**Discursive Representations of Loneliness in Human-Authored and
AI-Generated Texts: A Lexical Multidimensional Analysis**

This study investigates discursive representations of loneliness in
human-authored and AI-generated texts using lexical multidimensional
analysis (LMDA; Berber Sardinha & Fitzsimmons-Doolan, 2025). LMDA is an
extension of the original MD framework introduced by Biber in the 1980s
(Biber, 1988). Instead of using grammatical features as in the original
formulation, LMDA uses lexical features only, and the resulting
dimensions are interpreted as capturing the underlying discourses around
a particular issue as represented in a corpus. In this case, we are
interested in the discourses around loneliness; more specifically in how
loneliness is represented in self-disclosure posts in specialized
subreddits. For our understanding of loneliness, we rely on previous
work that conceptualizes loneliness as a socially mediated and
relational phenomenon (Ågren, 2017). Most prior work on AI and emotion
expression focuses on empathetic responding rather than self-expression
of an emotional state (Welivita & Pu, 2023). Typical tasks involve an AI
replying empathetically to a user who expresses sadness, distress, or
loneliness; the AI responses are analyzed usually via human ratings. In
this project, however, we take a variation-based corpus perspective to
the expression of loneliness by both human beings and AI through the
linguistic analysis of the latent discourses expressed when human beings
and machines talk about loneliness. Instead of relying on human ratings,
we rely on the dimensions revealed by LMDA to detect how human beings
and AI construct the expression of loneliness. To this end, three
subcorpora are compiled: a corpus of human-authored Reddit posts, and
two AI-generated corpora produced under different prompting conditions:
one guided by summaries of the human posts and one generated from a
generic prompt. To conduct the LMDA, we first tag each corpus for POS
and extract content words, whose counts are used for keyword extraction
by comparing each subcorpus against the other subcorpora. The resulting
keywords are tabulated, and these counts are entered in a factor
analysis. The resulting factors are interpreted as dimensions around
loneliness. In the presentation, we will introduce and illustrate the
dimensions, and will interpret and discuss the variation between the
human and AI discourses on loneliness.

**Discursive Representations of Loneliness in Human-Authored and
AI-Generated Texts: A Lexical Multidimensional Analysis**

This study investigates discursive representations of loneliness in
human-authored and AI-generated texts using lexical multidimensional
analysis (LMDA; Berber Sardinha & Fitzsimmons-Doolan, 2025). LMDA is an
extension of the original MD framework introduced by Biber in the 1980s
(Biber, 1988). Instead of using grammatical features as in the original
formulation, LMDA uses lexical features only, and the resulting
dimensions are interpreted as capturing the underlying discourses around
a particular issue as represented in a corpus. In this case, we are
interested in the discourses around loneliness; more specifically in how
loneliness is represented in self-disclosure posts in specialized
subreddits. For our understanding of loneliness, we rely on previous
work that conceptualizes loneliness as a socially mediated and
relational phenomenon (Ågren, 2017; Cover, 2016; Imrie, 2018; Oakley,
2020; Barreto et al., 2024), which contrasts with classical
psychological accounts that frame it primarily as an individual
affective state (Weiss, 1973; Perlman & Peplau, 1982). We are also
interested in how AI constructs discourses around loneliness. Previous
research has shown that AI can take on human personas, thereby
displaying particular human characteristics such as feelings and
emotions (Jiang et al., 2023). This goes beyond the implementation of AI
as intelligent machines: AI now becomes a feeling machine. We want to
know to what extent AI can generate texts that express loneliness. If
so, then the AI can be seen as being closer to a human being. Most prior
work on AI and emotion expression focuses on empathetic responding
rather than self-expression of an emotional state (Welivita & Pu, 2023).
Typical tasks involve an AI replying empathetically to a user who
expresses sadness, distress, or loneliness. In those studies, loneliness
is treated as input context, not as the *voice* or *stance* the model
must inhabit. Consequently, the output is evaluated for appropriateness,
supportiveness, or perceived empathy, usually via human ratings. In this
project, however, we take a corpus perspective to the expression of
loneliness by both human beings and AI through the linguistic analysis
of the latent discourses expressed when human beings and machines talk
about loneliness. Instead of relying on human ratings, we rely on the
dimensions revealed by LMDA to detect how human beings and AI construct
the expression of loneliness. To do that, we collect three subcorpora: a
corpus of Reddit posts (the human corpus), and two AI-generated corpora
based on two prompting conditions -- one where the AI was presented with
a prompt that included a summary of each human post and asked to
generate a Reddit post based on that summary, and another where the AI
was only told to generate a Reddit post on loneliness. To conduct the
LMDA, we first tag each corpus for POS and extract content words, whose
counts are used for keyword extraction by comparing each subcorpus
against the other subcorpora. The resulting keywords are tabulated, and
these counts are entered in a factor analysis. The resulting factors are
interpreted as dimensions around loneliness. In the presentation, we
will introduce and illustrate the dimensions, and will interpret and
discuss the similarities and differences between the human and AI
discourses on loneliness.
