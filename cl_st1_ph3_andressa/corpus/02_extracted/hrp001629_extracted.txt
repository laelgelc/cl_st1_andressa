I have spent most of my life in complete and utter loneliness. I had emotionaly abusive and absolutely emotionally neglectful parents to the point that I felt completely invisible. Had close to no friemds most of my life as I am autistic. Had to go through all the hard times on my own and had zero support as a child. I made my first good friend when i was 21 and now he lives in another city.

It annoys me that i cant ask for support and people assume my life is easy or fun. I feel like i am left with no choice, i cant complaim because things are not bad enough. And i cant feel seen because i have to pretend life is great because people act like i am just not supposed to feel that way regardless of circumstances.
