I’m 25, and honestly, I’ve never really had a genuine female friend. Not that I’ve never spoken to girls , I have , but it’s always been the basic “hi” and “bye” type of interaction. Nothing real or deep like the kind of friendships I see others have.

I often notice people around me , guys and girls , who share such genuine bonds. They talk, hang out, trust each other, and it all seems so natural. And then there’s me, wondering why it’s never been that way in my life.

The funny thing is, I’m not a bad guy, atleast i don't think i am. I genuinely care about people. Whenever someone needs help or advice, I’m always there ,no hesitation, no expectations. I listen, I support, I help however I can. But somehow, that same energy never comes back to me. It’s like I’m only valued for what I do for others, not for who I am.

Maybe it’s because I’m an introvert ,I don’t open up easily or push myself into people’s lives. But sometimes, I wish someone would just see the effort I quietly put in and be there for me the same way.

It’s not just about girls, though. Even with guys, I’ve realized most people talk to me only when they need something, maybe my help, knowledge, or skills. Rarely do people reach out just to connect.

Sometimes I question myself, is it something about me? Or is it just how the world has become lately? Do others feel this too, or am I the only one who feels like genuine connections are getting rarer these days?
