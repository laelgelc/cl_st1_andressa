I’m a 20-year-old college sophomore and I’ve never really dealt with my mental health the way I should. I get depressed sometimes, stuck in my own head. But the one thing that always pulls me out is my friend group. There’s six of us who all live together in a small 1000 square foot apartment and it feels like some movie-type friendship I never thought I’d have

Whenever I get in a hole mentally, I come home to laughing, music, random conversations, someone cooking, someone knocking on my door and it takes me out of it. I don’t think I’ve ever stayed truly depressed for more than a day because the house is so alive all the time. I know how rare that is.

Sure, a lot of people I know live with their friends, but I noticed they all have separate “circles” of friends outside of their house and do a lot of stuff without each other.  None of their groups are even close to how tight we are. 

It’s almost always all of us together, and somehow there’s never any issues.  No sub-groups, no people being left out. It just works and everyone is happy.  Some of us do have our separate (not as close) friends but we mainly just have each other.

And recently I started thinking about studying abroad because I love adventure and trying new things… but the thought of losing 6 months of the little time I have left with them hit me way harder than I expected. It didn’t just make me think about being gone but it made me realize all this friendship is temporary. In two years we are all going to move out, graduate, spread across the country, and I’m going to have to live alone. And that terrifies me.

 I don’t know if I’ll ever find another group of friends like this again. And thinking about how eventually I’ll be coming home to an empty house makes me scared that I’ll spiral or feel unbearably lonely.

It’s like studying abroad opened this door in my mind where I suddenly see how fragile and temporary this all is. I just feel really lucky but also really scared for when it ends.
