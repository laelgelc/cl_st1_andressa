A little over two years ago, my last remaining friend invited me over to hang out at his place, long story short, he ended up spending the whole time making fun of me with a third person (a friend of his and an acquaintance of mine), even said that my old highschool crush sent him nudes and that he's willing to share them with me (he knows how badly she rejected me), I realized then that I never really had friends... I was delusional, since I was a kid, my so called "friends" never kncluded me on anything fun... Furthermore, I was the butt of their jokes, I was being bullied my entire life and just living in denial, because the idea of having friends was the only thing that distracted me from my loneliness and depression.
