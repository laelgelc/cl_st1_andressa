Hello yall i just wanna say I think we all can agree being chronically lonely is the most ass thing in existence. I already deal with serious mental illness (if ur wondering i deal with extreme mood cycles for weeks on end)
but the worst part about that is all the friends I thought I had couldn't be bothered to check on me like at all.

Its bad for me because im so prone to have multiple voices inside of my head.

Online I try to talk with my "friends" and get kicked out of vc every time, and in real life I dont even have a social life. Not from anxiety but from a brutal self acceptance that im not normal and i feel a disconnect with most people who are normal. I feel like a skin walker 

My whole life I've basically been alone or looked at with pity and condescension from my peers. Not even kidding everyone thought I was autistic or simply just the R-Word.

Ive been left on read for months by people i thought I can open up to.
I poured my heart out to my mom about my issue yet cant get professional help.
I try to make friends with other youtubers and artists always fails. 
I try to do the right thing irl yet nobody likes me 
Nobody likes me at all.
Not even my own family I get ignored too by my moms boyfriend.

Whenever im in a high state of mood for weeks I cant sleep well I basically get zero. In turn I cant function. Then I blackout whenever something or someone gets me mad. Makes my organs feel like its dying. Boosts my sexual drive up and i cannot stand it mixed with depression.
So yea I hate my loneliness and mental health failure.
