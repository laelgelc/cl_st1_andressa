I went through a divorce and my parents moved out of state. As we are approaching the holiday season I am trying to get ahead of the curve of loneliness I know is coming for thanksgiving Christmas and new years. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what a single guy in his late twenties in a new city can do to enjoy the holidays as much as I can. Thank you!
