Some of my(31M) interests:

Cooking (I like experimenting. Turns out, dehydrated eggplant grinds into a very fine, fluffy powder.)

Video games (pokemon, Warframe, animal crossing)

Writing (Recently, I've been writing mostly MLP fanfic)

Books (Scifi/fantasy mostly)

Anime/manga/LN (Slice of life, Isekai, romcom)

Fanfic (I've been craving a good Naruto SI fic)
