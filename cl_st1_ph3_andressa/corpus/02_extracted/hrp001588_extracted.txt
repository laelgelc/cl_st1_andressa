Hey guys 19 year old guy here - I'd say I'm pretty naive and inexperienced in terms of life I feel that I've been pretty sheltered to a lot of things, so now I'm kind of curious about relationships.

I'm seeking a connection to find the right girl for me 

Someone I can talk to anything about, some intimacy

And to tell you the truth I'm kind of addicted to pornography, I think I'm addicted to it because it tries to emulate the feeling of intimacy. 

Part of me feels like I am missing out with the whole thing of relationships but part of me thinks that its not everything that life has to offer 

Am I missing out?
