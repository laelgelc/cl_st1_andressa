I'm already 25 and have very high difficulty when trying to socialize, I'm basically blind to social cues and body language, I have childhood friends but they are already settling in their own lives, we barely see each other anymore, I have already come to terms with the fact that I will be lonely for the rest of my life, most of the time it doesn't bother me but today it hit me again when the second of my college friends sent me an invitation to his graduation ceremony, it hurts because if feels like it was just yesterday we all met in discord because of covid, we used to spend all night talking and laughing, it was one of the few periods of my life I could say I was truly happy, now they will graduate and I know we will hear very little from each other again, I was already lonely before but now, it will go back to highschool levels of loneliness, where I spent 5 years (it was a technical highschool and I repeated one year, that's why it took longer) alone, needing to talk to myself to not go crazy.
