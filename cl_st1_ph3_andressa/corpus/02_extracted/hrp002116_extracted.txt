So, it's been a busy week sorry busy month. All the workload kept me super busy. But today I got a real holiday. A holiday without any work. And as anybody can guess it came back. Made few friends but I can't seem to hold them down. 

I don't even know what I want to say this time. It's just empty. Well I finished re-watching Dexter. Was giving intense hours all week. Escapism is the temporary help but that's all I can get.
