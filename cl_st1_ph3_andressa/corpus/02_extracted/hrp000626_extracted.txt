Hii,im sam,and hate myself for being stupid when I was younger I think I was being molested while being on ADHD drug that really shifted my mental state its hard to explain but because im not good at explaining things,but long story short ever since I lost a friend that i was really that like a brother to me due to events, ive just been on downward spiral but to be honest  I think the pieces to spiral were all there before we met,all my other friends have there own lives which I respect but im tired of caring for people and being there slaved get nothing in return,im tired of fighting people who ignore me,but its my fault for being to nice,so its whatever,im going to jump off bridge so this probably my last post.....bye I guess
