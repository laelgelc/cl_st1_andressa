Nothing really changed , I'm still alone and to be honest I kind of gave up on finding the one, surrounded by people that cannot understand me and I don't know what to do even going to a psychologist doesn't help I can't figure out what's wrong with me feeling so burned out every girl that have any interest in me disappeared after a month I'm not pushing them or do anything just pure love, I am obsessed with the idea of somebody loving you deeply since a really young age , is it that hard to find love or I'm just a freak
