Since she blocked me, she will not see this, so I can say it freely.  
Nothing of importance has happened, but still.  
A girl contacted me here, as a reaction to one of my posts here. We’ve exchanged a couple of messages. For some reason, she had a big problem with AI. No, like „either you give up AI for the rest of your life, or I’ll block you“ kind of a problem.  
I said my stance, about hoping the AI bubble will burst and so on. Apparently, that was not good enough for her.  
I even told her there is no need to block, we can just…calmly say out goodbyes and go our separate ways. Nope…  
I feel like I am in the kitchen with someone, and I calmly explaining stuff, and she just yells, is violent, while I am just…me.  
The problem with people today is that they cannot handle bit of difference. You hate AI? OK. I can talk to you, even though I use AI from time to time. I talk to people, who do stuff I’d outlawed, if I could. IDK. I’m 37, I grew up in different time, I’m also (thankfully) not from USA, I probably have different mentality.  
It just got me thinking, that is all. A lot of lonelyness is because of lack of tolerance. And from my experience, the spaces and people, who claim to be the most tolerant, are the most radical. You cannot have a different opinion, you must be exactly like everyone else.

Not that many people will probably read this, but if you read all of this and got here, take 1 thing away: don’t block people for the dumbest reasons.
