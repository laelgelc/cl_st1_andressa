I dont have many friends, im not the greatest at conversation, iv only just got reddit and i put a post up looking for someone to talk to and a girl messaged me around my age (21)and immidiatly got accused of being a b0t less than 10 minutes in, how bad do you have to be at conversation for the other person to draw the conclusion you arent eve real, crushing man.😢
