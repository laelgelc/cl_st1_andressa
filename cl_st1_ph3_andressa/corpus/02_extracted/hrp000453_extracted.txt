Like When I'm alone and feels like I'm not even a live or existing. Does anybody else feel this way like you never get any text messages? Nobody messes you on Messenger to see if you're even still alive, nobody cares you exist, what's the point of existing if you're just so alone? I Have no success with dating dating apps don't work, women treat me like I don't exist and invisible. This has been going on for 7 and a 1/2 years doesn't seem like it'll ever change. Can't Make any real world friends try to make friends on here and peep on here. Treat me like I don't exist and stop responding. Just like always cause, I'm not entertaining them enough wish I could have real friends and a real girlfriend that actually desires me what it would be nice to actually feel desire to not be alone anymore. I don't know only in my dreams and the same repeating day that I do every day is getting old. No motivation for any of this anymore.
