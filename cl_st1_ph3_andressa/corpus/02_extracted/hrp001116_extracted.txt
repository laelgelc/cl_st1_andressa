what is one to do when day in, day out I am alone. I am 22M years old and I have very little family, the family I do have I see maybe a couple times a year and when they reach out I barely have the strength to reply. I have no friends, no significant other, and I take care of my mother who has MS when I have the strength to leave my room. I go to work and come home, even at work I am alone as a delivery driver and do not talk to anyone at work. It has been like this since about 2019 and I am tired. I'm tired of feeling empty and alone when I know life has more to offer, am I a damned soul? is this my personality? am I not trying hard enough to connect with others? I'm not sure what this post will do, just seeing if anyone has had any success navigating through the meaningless (or meaningful) existence of consciousness.
