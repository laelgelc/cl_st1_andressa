I love my family and they love me. I love my job and the people there are just great. My friends are great. Everything is fine right now. There’s just some money issue but i am taking care of that.

I live alone nearby my office.

When i am in office or at home or with my friends, its good and i have the time of my life. 

But when i get to my room and i am alone it just sucks. 

How do i get over it? Wtf do i do? I need to get over this feeling and i’ll do anything for that to happen. 

Help me out y’all!!!
