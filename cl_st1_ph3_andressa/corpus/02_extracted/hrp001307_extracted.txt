Houseplants are my companions. The most recent count for what I have is 85. I don't have close friends so I've been putting my energy into them. Mostly coleus.

I have been raising slugs, and my Limax Maximus had roughly 30 babies hatch. they're such a cool creature to observe. 

I'm watching family guy. S2E5. Lois called Bonnie, Debbie. 

Don't mind me, I just needed to communicate with someone.
