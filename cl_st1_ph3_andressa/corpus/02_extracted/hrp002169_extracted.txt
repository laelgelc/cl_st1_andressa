I've been lonely for the past 4-5 years now. When I'm in large crowds, I feel..like an outcast..an outsider. Like I don't belong..even though every part of me yearns to fit in and to have just one person come up to me and say hi..(like in the movies lol). Or just one friend to be there for me when the thoughts become too much to bear, and the weight of the world seems heavier than usual.
