This year has been a real eye opener and I'm not gonna lie, it's scared the hell out of me. 
I'm 27, and my father died this year. It's always been my dad, grandma, and my self. But now it's just the two of us. It's not like she's in particularly bad health, but I'm scared of when it's just...Me, and it feels like I'm paralyzed now. I don't know if this is even the right place to be talking about this. 
I don't have any romantic interests, I just go to work and come home. I have friends sure but we are scattered in different towns and have our own lives your know? It just feels like if it's this bad now, what am I gonna do when it's really just me. 
I don't have the money for therapy or I would probably be in it already.  Any advice?
