Being the younger brother and seeing my older brother just drive to his different friend groups and have fun while im just at home with my parents is so depressing. I try to convince myself that im better alone but I cant see that for myself. Hes always texting someone and laughing while the only “friend” i truly text is him. I cant convince myself that im better off alone, i can’t convince myself im happy when Im at home and I know where he is. I have friends but none of them are outside of school friends, and honestly its just really depressing for me and im lost at what to do and how to deal with it.
