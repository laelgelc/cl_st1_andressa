at this point i’ve genuinely given up on connecting with people, i feel like an alien wearing human skin whenever i’m around others. the autism makes it impossible to get past the “acquaintance” phase and the depression makes me not even want to bother. i don’t know how to keep conversations going and it makes me feel so nervous like i have to write out a script. 

i’m incredibly jealous and upset when i see girls my age with friends because i tell myself that will never be me. i haven’t had a friend since i was like 10 years old and even then i was always still left out, ive never been the “best friend” 

it makes it worse how i live in New Zealand in a small city, i feel like once you’re my age you should of already established friends so its impossible to make new ones. let alone with autism, i would love to have a friend i was comfortable with because i have no clue what that’s even like…..my only friend is my grandmother.
