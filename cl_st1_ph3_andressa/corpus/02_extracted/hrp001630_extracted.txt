I'm 30(F), INTJ-T if that matters. The past few years I've started experiencing reminiscing episodes about my high-school and 20s years. They start so happy then turn to painful nostalgia. It can get triggered by listening to the first ten seconds of a song. Very difficult to avoid triggers. 
Some context:I used to be social, then after lock down and four cases of covid I developed bad social anxiety. It seems I've lost all my friends, and it seems like everyone I used to know are flourishing, moving forward in their lives. It doesn't help that I tend to hoard memories of happy times. It's not a conscious decision. 

I really want to overcome the anxiety and try salvage old friendships. Unfortunately, I don't live in the same city as many of them anymore. So, meeting new people and such would be ideal. I really want to overcome the social anxiety. 

Maybe worth mentioning, I live in South Africa, I struggle with depression and anxiety in general, I study full-time online (ironically to become a counsellor) with almost no contact sessions. I also got bad burnout in November and December. 
Lastly, I've gained quite a bit of weight, which really affects my self esteem. However, it has definitely made me more sympathetic to others who also struggle with overeating. 

Alcohol used to make me social and feel comfortable and fun around people. I stopped drinking a few years ago because it messed with my antidepressant sporadically, I could never manage it in such a way that I could prevent embarrassing drunkeness and such. Also, alcoholism in the family is scary to me, I'm scared I might start the night with one drink and end up drinking way too much like I used to. Lowered inhibitions have negatively affected my life in the past, and I'm a more devout Christian now.

The intense loneliness and nostalgia is physically painful. 
ANY advice is greatly appreciated!
