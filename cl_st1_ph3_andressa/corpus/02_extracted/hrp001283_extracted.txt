4 relationships, more than 15 flirts and i am done. It's going nowhere. I am tired of ghosting, neglecting and ignoring. I do everything, literally everything but my smallest wish is bothering her. I am tired of this. All i want was having a peaceful life but i believe it's impossible.

I dream travelling, living together with somebody who understand me  but what i have is a huge zero.
