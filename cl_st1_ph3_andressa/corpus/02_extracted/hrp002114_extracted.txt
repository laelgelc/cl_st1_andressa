Just for context M 32 nearly 33 single Dad, never been one to tolerate people BS but seems to have put me in a position where I’m alone a lot. I have one really good friend who I can talk to regularly but even that’s a struggle  because he’s married and busy which I get but he puts effort in which I appreciate, I can never seem to find luck with dating, and even trying to reconnect with old friends seems impossible now a days. How do you folks deal with it??
