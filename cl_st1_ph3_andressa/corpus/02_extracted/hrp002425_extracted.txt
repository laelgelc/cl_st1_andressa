So, I've tried to use the internet to meet new people & find friends; sometimes I do so by trying to find people who have similar values/worldviews, sometimes I try to find other people who mention lacking friends & struggling with loneliness.  
  
The internet can be a shitty, toxic place; sometimes I clash with people like this, even though I thought they and I might be able to get along. It costs effort to find people and again to be vulnerable. I've noticed a pattern with people-- their go-to parting insult tends to be some variant of "no wonder you're alone."    
  
They also tend to belittle my attempts to reach out. Most recently, someone called me weird for reaching out to him because I'd searched google for keywords related to my interests & worldview, and saw something he left in a public forum related to a game I play. And then when I said he was unfriendly and didn't want to talk anymore, that's exactly what he said.   
  
The point isn't he said she said; people are allowed to not like me & vice versa. In my opinion, this exact insult though is really fucking mean. It makes me question what the point of trying with people is. And I know people will say, don't bother with the internet.. but the reality is that many people find online friends, and it's not like people can't be utter horse shit irl, too.  
  
I think this is about as fucked as using someone's family member's cancer as an attack or laughing at their dead pet just to spite someone. "No wonder you have no friends", to someone who took the risk to try to say hello to you with the sole intent to talk and maybe become friends.
