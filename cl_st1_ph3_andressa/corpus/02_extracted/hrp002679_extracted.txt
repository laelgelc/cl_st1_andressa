Since Grade 8 when my acne starts to appear until now ( Grade 12 ) cuz its on our genes, i don't know what to do it affects my confidence specially now online class and open cam, I always think if they stare at me on their phones and teasing me in their minds, Its so hard to deal with acne, its not a joke. But its normal to everyone, Some of my friends tell me that i should take a bath and i dont have a proper hygine like im a dirty person and it makes me really sad that even my friends thinks im a dirty person just because i have acnes. To those people who have friend that has acne or any skin disease support them don't tease them because having this kind of problems is not a joke, AS A FRIEND YOU SHOULD LIFT THEM UP AND NEVER DRAG THEM DOWN.
