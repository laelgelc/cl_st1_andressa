I have been feeling like this in my entire life. It always feels like a chore when people call me over to an event. When I go, half the time I enjoy the event a lot but I still want to go back home early. It is like I constantly desire what I do not have at that moment. Or could it be because I choose wrong people? I do not really know.

I have had many close friendships in my teens and early 20s but I moved abroad and people grow apart. I am still connected to many of them, but I do not have any in-person friends that I meet regularly. This hits like a brick, especially during winter times. I work, work out and sleep in in a cycle everyday for the last few years. Feels like I am waiting for my life to start and I am killing time in the meantime.

Looking back now I realize that I acquired all my friends through school/university. Feels like it was always under forced circumstances or another person "adopting me" as a friend.

I hate this. When I am home, I am constantly missing having close friends around that I can truly be myself with. But I have zero mental mental energy or motivation to cultivate such a friendship.

I am also 30 soon and I am single so I am starting to realize things are not going to get better.

Anyway, just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading.
