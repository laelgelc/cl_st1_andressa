I (Female, 18) feel as though I can relate to men who are loners, I see lonely men all the time and it seems normal for men to be alone. I have never ran into a single female like me though, women tend to have a group of friends or at least ONE person they can talk to, I have no one. High school was hell, I was the only girl in my entire school who sat alone at lunch, I went for weeks not saying a single word and keeping my head down, most people didn't even know my name. From grade 10 to graduation I didn't have a friend. I am in my first year uni and I want to make these years count, but Im so scared its gonna be a repeat of high school... I personally find it much easier being alone but I hate the embarrassment of it. I want to know people, I want to have friends. I feel like an outcast.....It would be so comforting to hear from another girl with the same experience as me.
