I think I'm just imagining things in places that aren't there. I've been alone for a year now, and from what I've seen and experienced, I'll be alone for another year. I've had a rough life since I was little; it got worse when I was 12. I've always suffered from heartbreak, and you know, I remember my last girlfriend telling me, "I just want to see you with someone else, I want to see you happy." She already has someone with her, and that doesn't bother me, but I tried to pursue other relationships, and nothing happened. I just wore myself out mentally, and my brain can't take it anymore. My brain and my emotions are at rock bottom. I try and try, and nothing. But lately, I just go out on the street and see other people happy, and I ask myself, "Can I go on alone?" or "I hope that guy is happy." The truth is, I don't know if I'll keep walking and moving forward anymore. Slowly, I've felt something for someone, and I already see that little bit as something bad. She reacts to my compliments, we go out, she's just gotten over a breakup, etc. But I don't know anymore if I'm just a friend (like always) or something more. I just don't know. I'm tired of surviving like this since I was a child.
