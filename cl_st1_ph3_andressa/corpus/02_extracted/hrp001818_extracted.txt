I am struggling and I do not know where else to say this.

Most nights I cry. The thought that I might stay lonely my entire life scares me more than I want to admit.

I have friends. But when I try to open up, the response is always shallow.
“I don’t know what to say.”
“Don’t overthink it.”

That shuts everything down. I stop talking. They move on. I sit with it alone.

I am tired of being the one who always reaches out. I want someone to text me first. I want someone to ask how I am without being prompted. Right now, it feels like I only exist when I initiate.

What messes with my head is that I was okay not long ago. The second half of last year was stable. Then 2026 started and everything dropped fast. I wake up heavy. I sleep heavy. The silence feels suffocating.

I keep asking myself hard questions. What is wrong with me. Why does nobody check in. Why does it feel like I am easy to ignore. These thoughts spiral and I feel myself slipping.

I am scared this loneliness will consume me if nothing changes.
