   I don't want sympathy or advice how to be less lonely. It won't work. I'm autistic and disabled. I can't go to the gym I can't just suddenly understand social situations. I just want to find out how to not think about how alone I am all the time. I've gotten to the point where I can't watch or play anything with ANY romantic elements without it ruining my day. I used to be stoned 24/7 but after a year sober it still hasn't gotten better. I don't want to go back to that because it stops me from doing the very few things I enjoy. Any advice on how to start accepting it so I can still enjoy the few things I have left?
