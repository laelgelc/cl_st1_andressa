University has been one of the loneliest experiences of my life. 

I don't have real friends at school, only people I see briefly in class. No one texts or calls me (trust me, I've been the constant initiator). I go to class, eat alone, drive home, study, and spend most evenings by myself. Weekends are often even more sad. 

  
I crave connection and social stimulation, but it feels like I'm always the one reaching out and rarely being chosen. It's been like this since I started university, and it's slowly worn me down. 

  
I'm posting because I feel stuck and would really appreciate hearing from people who can relate or who have been through something similar. 

  
Did anyone else feel this isolated in university? What helped you cope when you felt invisible? Did things improve after this phase of life?
