I got invited anywhere fun. No parties, no night outs, no dates, or vacations. After every fun event or date she attends she starts telling me all her stories about the fun she had. How she's at a party or the club with her drunk stories and the attention she gets from guys the vacations she's been on. Meanwhile I'm stuck sitting there having to listen. Anytime I've mentioned that I wished I got invited out and went places she doesn't care and I get ignored. Even when she needs a ride home or needs something from me I end up doing it for her. Why should I have to sit here and have to listen to her talk about her fun? It's like showing off candy to a child's face saying "I have candy! But too bad you don't and I'm going to eat it in your face!!!"
