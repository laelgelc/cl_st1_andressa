TLDR: I am umemployed and live with my parents because I have health issues. I have 0 friends because it's hard to go out when you feel terrible.

It's been 5 years since I graduated highschool. My health took a turn for the worst in late 2021 and then I have stabilized. I do feel like shit everyday tho. 

I'm an only child and have been fine with being alone most of my life but not the weight of being friendless is hitting me. I am so jealous of people who have others they can share memes with and talk to when they are excited.

I'm starving for friends. I like LOTR, Star Wars, Warhammer Fantasy, cooking and history. If you are around your early 20s and are interested then please dm me 🙏

I want people man
