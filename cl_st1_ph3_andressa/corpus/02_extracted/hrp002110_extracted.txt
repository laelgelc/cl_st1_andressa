Guess I’m not sure what to say or do besides be a “right fighter” I just disgust myself anymore and it’s not that I’m a bad person it’s just everything eternally despite how stoic I try to be and strong just wants to crush the air from my lungs, normally by now I erase all this and never post it in the first place but maybe it will make someone feel less lonely. My current girlfriend moved in to greener pastures as I wasn’t what she wanted anymore I suppose.i get it why wouldn’t anyone wanna be with me let alone around me temporarily. I don’t even know why I’m complaining. It’s better that she should be happy with me than miserable with me right. Hell I’m miserable with me
