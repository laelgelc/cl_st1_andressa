Hello :) I hope you are all well. I'm currently based in Scotland but I've been in a lot of cities around the UK and Ireland recently, looking for somewhere to settle down. I like philosophy, music, MMA, football (soccer), gaming and YouTube. I'm not really a small talk person so hit me with some deep philosophical questions or hot takes and let's talk! I've just got out of a kind of long relationship so take that however you want to! I'm not really in a super popular part of the world but I'm down for meet ups, online chats, whatever floats your boat! I'll try my best to accomodate
