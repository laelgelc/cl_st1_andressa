I cannot even think of where to start. I’ve been feeling useless. I don’t know if people around me even love me. I don’t feel valued. I feel overwhelmed. My boyfriend has only ever constantly picked on my faults lately. I do believe that he loves me. I want to know I’m cared for and loved! Is that too much to ask? I never get checked upon if I’m fine and everything I do is always taken for granted. Everyone believes they are better and off without me so what’s the point of me living. I hardly have people around and it’s getting too hard. I’m just not sure how long I’ll be able to hold my sanity.
