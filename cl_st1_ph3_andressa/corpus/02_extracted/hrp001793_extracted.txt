Recently I've felt like I don't belong here on earth. I think of every possible thing that could happen in my life, if I move somehwere better, if I make more friends, if I find a good job, but none of that takes the weight off of my chest. I feel so alone and nothing seems like it will ever fix it. I feel so out of place everywhere. There's just this deep sense of despair I have that I can't see through. It's like there's no possible situation I can imagine where I feel happy or okay. I feel like I'm so out of place here.
