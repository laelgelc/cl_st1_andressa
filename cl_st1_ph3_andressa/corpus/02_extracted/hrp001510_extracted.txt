Im 17m, my past post have been really depressive and I thought that if I became more positive, take better care of myself that my life is all of a sudden gonna get better.
And it didn't, I don't have friends anymore they all talk about me behind my back, they make fun of my humor, my appearance and my mannerisms, the very few people I trusted 
Everyday is just another humiliation, im ugly.
Im so ugly all my proportions are all of, every time I walk by my mirror I just want to shatter it, every time I work out I have to close my eyes so I don't see my reflection in the mirror,
I can't trust people, I don't even understand people,I try and try but I just can't talk to people or communicate what I want to express, I think i might have autism.
I keep on getting into fights with my parents because I'm scared to go outside, I'm scared that someone from my school will see me and make fun of me with the other students.
Im so ugly im scared to love someone, every time I develop a crush on someone, it becomes an internal battle, I feel like a creep, im scared that someone would see me as like a lolcow like crisschan or nova online.
My grade are also horrible I might have to repeat grade 10 for the second time.
I just wish I can have someone I can care about, not even a lover just someone I can care about and unmask around and just be the real me.
Im pathetic I don't understand people, I've never had a partner, people find a reason to make fun of me as soon as I open my mouth, I'm fucken pathetic, I just want to be cared about.
Is that too hard to ask for.
I think I'll kill myself
