Honestly, I’m incredibly angry and disappointed. Yes, we had our fair share of arguments, breaks, and disagreements, but I don’t believe anyone deserves this. I trusted him. He was a completely different man years ago, made me believe that he planned to marry me, and now he’s changed completely. He’s no longer the man I met. I feel like he’s a stranger to me now. We’ve broken up, and it’s heartbreaking. I had hoped to get married soon. I’m in my mid-twenties, and I feel like my time is slipping away. I’m feeling quite down because this relationship didn’t work out. He even admitted that he doesn’t love me, and hasn’t for a while now. I don’t have any family or friends.
