I had been scrolling through social media lately and I noticed the blackpill content that has been going on and popular, which basically saw human's likeability based mainly on looks, and I think to myself, maybe this is why it's so hard to build a connection with someone in real life, because online, I'm doing fine, I even got myself a few handy friends online.
So, by acknowledging the fact that maybe it's all about looks, which of course, cannot be altered because its roots is in genes, I thought to myself that maybe I was not created by god to procreate, but for some other purpose, maybe to go out there and do something to the world, something to change and alter, like Travis Bickle's assassination of the pimp holding Iris, have you ever thought about it?
