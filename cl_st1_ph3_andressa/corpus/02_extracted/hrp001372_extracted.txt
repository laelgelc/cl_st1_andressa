I got s chronic disability due to it it makes walking hard,the doctors don't know the cause and I don't know what to do i was fine the first few months but after the 6months mark I started getting worse. I felt empty and lonely im stuck in my room all day I don't even have online gaming communities or anything I don't have anyone to play games with and it all hurts when im lonely i lookf for more stimulation anything to mask it i go deep into philosophy anime anything i even started learning new skills but i barely have people to share it with so i just sit here lost with no direction. I occasionally join streams but i don't want to make them uncomfortable. Anyways idk honestly. My family tells me to go outside but walking is so painful that i avoid it. Everyone graduated and is living theur lives my irl  friends moved away and are getting busy and feel like i shouldn't dumo this on them. The pain got really bad last year December when i graduated.
