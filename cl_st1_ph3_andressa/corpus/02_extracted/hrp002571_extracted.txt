It is in solitude where the most beautiful ideas form. It helps you find yourself. When I say solitude it means hours without social media or any mundane social conversations. Obviously one to one conversations help, but hey, how often do we find it. Besides the only person who can improve our lives is ourself. Some people may want body, money, etc. If one door (social connection) closes, why keep looking at the closed door? Look at the other doors you've opened. You can focus more on that tree on your walk which you might've missed if you had gone with a friend. And so on and so forth. Social interactions are craved because it stimulates dopamine. It gets like an addiction. And withdrawal is loneliness. Occasional necessary loneliness is enough. Just like limited amount of sugar. Plus true happiness comes from fulfilling what you previously promised and owe to your future self. If you have people you owe, for them. If you are alone, for the greater good. The child you once were and the old grumpy elder you'd become. Life is like a long marathon where we choose to run it alone and without having onlookers. The satisfaction level remains the same as long as we put the effort. All the best. We'll all in this together placed in different space and time.
