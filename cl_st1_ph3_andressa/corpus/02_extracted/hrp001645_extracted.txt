I am free as a person. I can do what I want but I feel imprisoned by myself. I am in a prison and have been long enough. the reason why i am imprisoned is the fear i have of a person. the person themselves said they destroyed my confidence because they didn't want me to reach my highest potential as it scared them.
I think it's awfully cruel to do so as I feel trapped and can't depend on my own judgment nor do anything about this problem. Idk if there is someone out there that feels this way, but please if there is tell me that I'm not alone as for now this horrendous loneliness is getting to me.
