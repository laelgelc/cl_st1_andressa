Not trying to jinx anything... but I (M20) am genuinely so happy right now, I had to get this off my chest. 

l've never dated anyone before. For the longest time, I've craved what it would feel like to have a girl like me, not just in a shallow way, but in that mutual, fun, warm, I-like-you-as-you-are kind of way. To be able to give love and receive it, to feel like someone genuinely wants to talk to me, laughs at my jokes, and cares about how my day is going.

Well, I've been talking to this girl (F18) I matched with recently on Hinge (we moved to texting within two days of just talking), and I don't know how else to say it... But things are actually clicking. She's funny, sweet, and thoughtful, and I feel like we're both putting in the effort.

Every message makes me smile like an idiot, and I can't help but replay our convo and just feel good. Not anxious, not overthinking every word... just happy.

I know it's early (It's been only three days so far). I know it might not last (I hope it lasts for a very long time). But this feeling, this hopeful, giddy, soft excitement, is something I've waited a long time for. I am so unbelievably happy right now. And I just wanted to share that, because if you're someone who's been in that same waiting space... I promise, your moment can come too.

Thanks for reading. 🫶
