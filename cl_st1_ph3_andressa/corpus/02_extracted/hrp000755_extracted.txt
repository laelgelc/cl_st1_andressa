I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 9 years. He has cheated on me twice by talking to other girls. When I found out, he apologized and asked for another chance, saying he truly wants my forgiveness. I love him deeply, and even after everything, I’m struggling to let him go. I’m not on good terms with my family, and he’s the only person I have in my life right now — that’s what makes this so hard for me.
