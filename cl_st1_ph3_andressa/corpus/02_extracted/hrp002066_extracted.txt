Ive chosen to be alone all my life (21) and I want to say im miserable but im just empty. I made the decision to be alone unconsciously over many years, never putting the effort to maintain, grow and learn friendships. Leading me to make unfulfilling relationships that poisoned my perception of self and made me feel i was better off staying away from people.

It's funny the self imposed isolation feels like a sevice to everyone else. Thoughts like I have nothing to offer to people or any time spent with me is better spent doing anything else make selfish desires to protect myself from being received into noble martyrdom. Even writing this i know it's absurd to think like this (still do it though).

I feel like anyone else put in my position they would just get a grip and try to do improve themsleves to live a better life. I feel that I have lost all fight to try to be better. It makes me sad thinking about this as a better life is out there but you have to make the first steps alone, I just cant bring myself to help myself.

Dont really know what im trying to say but better out than in
