I really hate how I am always always always get hurt the se way over and over and over all because I want to heal the little me? 

I am always the calm and patient one but since I started getting in tune with my feelings I just keep getting heartbroken 
Each time I am ignored breaks me into so many pieces  I don't know what to do anymore 
How can I stop feeling hurt over rejection...
