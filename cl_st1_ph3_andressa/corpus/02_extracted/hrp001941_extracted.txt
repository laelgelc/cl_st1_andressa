I watch them, and they're just so... normal. They have drama, they have emotions, they're... happy to be together. None of them are weird, none of them are freaks. None of them are like me. It's such a foreign experience, seeing people together, seeing the way they laugh and joke, seeing the way that they get to feel... comfortable in their own skin. The way that they know how to belong. To fit in. And it all makes me mind-numbingly, soul-crushingly jealous. I want so badly to know what that's like. To fit in. To belong. Yet, here I am. Alone, at the end of every day, like always. None of my friends come looking for me. Nobody is... hoping to see me, or hear from me. They might be happy to see me, yes, but that's... a pleasant suprise. That's all I ever get to be. Maybe it's selfish but I just want, for once, ever, someone to come looking. I want someone to think about me without me having to be right in front of their face. But, I guess, clearly that's asking too much.
