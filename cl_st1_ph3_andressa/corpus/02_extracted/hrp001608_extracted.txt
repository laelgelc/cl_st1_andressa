Yeah. I saved up money, taking care of my health. I can travel, adventure. Who cares about finding a girlfriend? That's not my problem anymore. I'm getting older and the older I get the less romantic I am anyways.

Animals almost always fill that void better than humans do. I respect them as individuals. They do their thing and I do mine.
I will be in the shadows observing things while waiting to die patiently.
