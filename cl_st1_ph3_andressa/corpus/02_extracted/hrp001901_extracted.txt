Hi, I've been feeling kind of lonely lately. 
A year ago I moved to a small town because I moved in with my partner. I never had friends, I mostly hanged out with my family, but after my mom's passing 2 years ago I slowly drifted away. Now I live almost 200 km away from everyone I know. 
I tried making friends here, I took ukelele classes, started pilates and also going to the gym, but this being a small town everyone knows each other and it is not very welcoming. 
It's hard for me to go visit my family regularly because I cannot drive (I have no license and driving terrifies me). During the first couple of months I took a bus regularly to see them, but it drained me. 
I don't regret moving here, I love my partner, but he works rotative 12 hours shifts so we barely see each other.
I would really like to have some virtual buddies to chat with, video call, watch movies or shows, play videogames, but I don't know any platform I can get into to know people. Any recommendations? I tried randochat but connections are rare there.
