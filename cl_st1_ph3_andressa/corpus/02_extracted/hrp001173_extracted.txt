Why like 2 days i feel happy my mode is good i can easily laugh i have energy to talk to people but the rest of the weak my energy fades a way i dont have energy to do any thing  like doing some coding work. Which iss something i love doing it feels heavy, even talking to my family it feels heavy when anyone ask me about something i just give him short answer, maybe because i have been isolated and kinda lonely for the past 2 years but it affected my social life i cant make new friends idk even if i want to because ik it will need talk all the time and that drains me and also i fear someone call me boring but also i want to know new people i iwant to live my age but how to do that alone idk, i tried once to go out alone because i heard that its fun and got bored then returned home, not wondering why idont have friends even me got bored from my self, does anyone gone through the what im in rn? Or its just me?
