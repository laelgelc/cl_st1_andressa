As someone who has always been a quiet and introverted person, making friends has never come easily to me. My husband was my best friend. We were so happy. We have been married for quite some time now, I can't help but feel increasingly lonely in our relationship.Days go by I can't help but feel that I'm  being completely ignored, we don't talk anymore and I have no one to confide in about this. It's a heartbreaking realization. Reading some of your posts make me feel not so alone.
