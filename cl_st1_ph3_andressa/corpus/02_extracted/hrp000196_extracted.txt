Last year I thought I could. I was getting promoted at my job, had a good amount of friends, a beautiful girl was interested in me, and I was finally getting my life on track. Then everything went to shit.

The promotion never came cuz of high turnover. I started school so work and school together ruined my social life. A lot of my friends slowly lost touch with me. The girl I loved was in college on the other side of the country but was moving back near me soon, so I was excited to see her again and ask her out. But turns out she was just trying to fuck and when I told her that I liked her and thought she liked me, she simply responded that ‘like’ is a strong word and she doesn’t catch feelings for people. 

So I quit my job at the end of last year and lost my friends I had there. And I lost a girl that was everything to me because it turns out I was nothing to her. And I stopped working out because of my depression I fell into. I cut myself off from the world.

Now I’m trying to get it together which is terrifying. I got a new job which seems cool enough but the people there kinda suck. I’m back to working out but I can’t lift anywhere near what I could a few months ago and my body is in deep pain. I’m gonna go back to school in the summer. But no real friends besides a couple roommates. Not a great relationship with my family. A significant other seems laughable to me at this point. It just sucks because I wanted to die for so long and stopped caring. Now I’m slowly trying to get my life together, but the pain is still there and there’s no signs of it going away. No matter what I just get the feeling that I’ll never be seen as worth anyone’s time and not be good enough for anything I try to do in this world.
