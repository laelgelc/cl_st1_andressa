You know what it is when it is what it is.

I don't go to bars.
I don't go to clubs.
I don't ask coworkers out. In fact, I assume most people at work don't want to be asked out because it makes them uncomfortable.
I might go to some meetup groups but mostly, I've stayed back because of the inconvenience of driving 20+ miles.
Nobody owes anybody anything; that means, if you're sad and lonely, too bad. Society doesn't owe you anything.
Been there, done that with complaining about being lonely in my younger years. No one needed to save me.
I'm close to 40. Never had anyone, and didn't die. That proves I never needed anyone to feel whole. I didn't even have my mom given I lost her at age 3. 

Who cares about the declining birth rate? I'm gravitating towards cosmic extinction the way I look at society these days. Who cares about the male loneliness epidemic. Maybe things are actually meant to be this way.... probably because it just is and there is no recourse?

I'm just here, on this earth, with people I could sometimes care less about. Still, though. Cool shit. See shit, eat food, travel, play video games.
