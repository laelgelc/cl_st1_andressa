I’m a 30F looking for a logical and honest answer, away from idealized ideas.

Is it actually possible for a person to live their whole life alone and still be strong, self-confident, and happy from within?

Is solitude a truly sustainable and healthy choice, or do humans naturally need a life partner to feel fulfilled and stable?

I’d love to hear real opinions and experiences, whether they agree or disagree.
