I recently met an 80 year old woman who just lost her sister and husband. She’s writing a book and has a recipe website she’s been working on for over a year. It would make the world for her to get some likes on her website, she was overjoyed with just one like. Please check it out, life is short and one like will make the world for her. And she’s got some fun recipes.
