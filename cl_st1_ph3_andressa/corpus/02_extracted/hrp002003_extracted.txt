For a bit of context I've (27 M) been alone for about 10+ years, no family, no friends. Moved to where I live right now about 5 years ago and literally know no one.

  
But in the past 6 months I've been trying to work on myself, go out of my comfort zone. Past weekend I went to a local anime convention in my city. It was okay, walked around, 2 people commented saying they liked my jacket which was nice (It's from a video game/anime).

Then near the end I sat down in one of the main halls waiting for the final panel. It was pretty packed and I sat on the edge of a row, so when this girl and her friends were trying to find a seat, I slid to give them room to go by me. Then she saw my jacket and commented on it, and sat next to me.

We talked for the next 1-2 hours, I honestly forgot how nice it feels to talk to someone with similar interests. It felt so natural, and we just flowed from one topic to the next. As it wrapped she asked to trade info to keep in contact (on the purple messaging platform that I can't write here). 

I was super excited when I got home, kept waiting for her to add me, then she did. I waited a bit and then sent a message, and then waited... and waited... sent another just checking if she was getting them.

It's been a few days and still no response. And here I was dumb enough to think I finally made a friend. Makes me just want to crawl back in my hole.
