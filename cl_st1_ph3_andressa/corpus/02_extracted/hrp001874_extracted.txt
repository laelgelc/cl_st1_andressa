Nothing crazy, just a friend. A real one, that wasn't online. One that I could go do stuff with. One that enjoyed my company. She laughed at my jokes and enjoyed listening to my ramblings. We could hug. 

It's been so long. Most of the time I feel like I'm fine, but when a dream like this happens, it kinda rocks me. I miss having somebody.
