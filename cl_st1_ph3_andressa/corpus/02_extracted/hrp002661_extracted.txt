Some people I mean. I like being alone. I always have since I was a kid. That being said, society has only made me enjoy being alone more. 

A lot of people associate it with being depressed and lonely. I have great friends, I just prefer to be alone. It’s peaceful. Solitude is bliss. I haven’t hung out with someone since maybe February? Snowboarding. 

It just irritates me when I’m at the gym or somewhere, just minding my business, listening to music and doing my thing, and I can see/hear people sometimes judge me. 

For instance the gym staff have nothing better to do but gossip and I can sometimes hear them. Not only there but also at work and reading people’s comments online. I hear things like “he’s weird”, “maybe he’s gay” from women, “he must be a douche”, “he’s awkward”. “You’ll regret being alone eventually”. “Loners are stuck up”. No I will not regret it because I’ve found great people and they understand that I like being alone. 

I know I shouldn’t care, and for the most part I don’t. I’ve achieved tranquility alone and don’t constantly thrive attention nor do I need an ego boost.

It’s just annoying and closed minded. Everywhere I go. Why can’t everyone just mind their business and move on? (Rhetorical). I know society in general is like that. 

I just enjoy being alone. 

Anyways, just venting to other loners out there.
