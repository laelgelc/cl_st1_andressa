Being alone doesn’t always feel like silence. Sometimes, it feels like a slow echo—your own voice ricocheting off the walls with no one there to catch it. At first, solitude offers clarity, peace even. You hear your own thoughts more clearly. You remember how to breathe.

But over time, that same silence starts to sting. The walls close in. The mind, unchallenged and unchecked, becomes a cruel mirror, reflecting every flaw, every regret, every missed chance. Days blur. Your voice grows quieter because there’s no one left to respond. You forget how to be seen.

Loneliness doesn’t always scream—it often whispers. It convinces you that no one cares, that you’re too much or never enough. It rewrites your self-worth. It makes you afraid to reach out, and even more afraid no one will reach back.

And slowly, without realizing, you become a version of yourself you don’t quite recognize. Hardened. Guarded. Tired in a way that sleep can’t fix.

Being alone for too long doesn’t just change you—it erodes you. Not all at once, but like water against stone. Quietly. Constantly. Until one day, you forget what it felt like to be understood.
