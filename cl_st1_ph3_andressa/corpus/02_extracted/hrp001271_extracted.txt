Yet another New Year’s all alone. 2025 hurt in so many ways. I thought I found some friends but they turned out to be using me, hanging out with me out of convience. And I haven’t been on a single date. Not a single guy showed interest. Swell that’s a lie. Guys showed interest in sex. But not in me. I’ve re-downloaded and deleted dating apps so many times in the last few months. But nothing ever happens. 

It’s hard not to feel like something is wrong me. Considering how hard I tried not to be here in the beginning of the year, I’m not optimistic about 2026. My whole life has been pain. Why would it stop now?
