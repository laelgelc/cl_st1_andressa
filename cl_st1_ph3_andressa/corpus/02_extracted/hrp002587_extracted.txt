Or used to be.I 18F used to be VERY depressed for 4 years and just now started fixing my life. Because of this I isolated myself a lot(no friends at all that 1 friend is an recent upgrade) and now I have only one friend that doesn't want to go out and would rather stay in...But I LOVE going out and walking and seeing other people. Social interactions irl make me feel more alive.But I have no one to go out with!!And my social skills are shit😭

Anyone else that is like that?Maybe we can start chatting and talk about ways to become more social.
