I'm looking to chat and meet a guy who's into gaming. I am into super skinny , skinny, scrawny, geeky, nerdy gamer guys. I also don't mind meeting up eventually. All ages are welcome .

If you aren't interested romantically, we can def be bros/friends. 

I am African American, male , 28, career professional. 

I play HellDivers 2, Fortnite, Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals , GTA 5, and Black ops 6 and 7 on Ps5

I'm interested in learning MTG/DND as well. 

DM me or comment if interested.
