I'm 27 and I have a couple of friends I met in middle school but don't hang out with much anymore. On weekends, I try to go to places where I can meet new people, but it's so hard to get close to them and talk to them; the anxiety is blocking me. Do you have any suggestions on where I can meet new people and talk to them without feeling like a nuisance or awkward?
