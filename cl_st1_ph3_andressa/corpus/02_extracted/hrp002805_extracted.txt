I don't like socializing every much and the fundamental reason I feel like is that I don't find social interaction as beneficial. I don't seem to feel emotional comfort or the happiness that comes from social interaction.

I've been wondering the cause and it seems to boil down to parenting. My mom was very controlling and I always thought she was abusive and unfair. I think from this repeated interaction I've come to think about people in a negative way. My parents never came to my school events or cared about life milestones like graduation or birthdays. This kind of atmosphere at home made me also neglectful of others and I've come to think of social interaction or even having tight group of friends as unnecessary. Even now I don't really understand if it is neccessary to have birthday parties or even celebrate it. 

 My parents also tend to try to limit my social activities by devaluing my relationship with others or being critical about my friends and other kind of relationships. This has made me somewhat distant from people in general. 

So I don't know. Does this sound similar to your experience?  I generally don't feel uncomfortable being a loner but sometimes wonder why I am so different in feeling less positive/indifferent about socializing or being in a relationship or any intimate relationship.
