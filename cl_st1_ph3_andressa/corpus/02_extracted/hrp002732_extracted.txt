I’m looking for more friends, I only have 2... I’m gonna be very active, if you want I can add you back. My interests are music and acting and I really feel like this sub fits for me because I’m also an introvert not just a loner. I’ve been alone for a really rough period of my life but everything is getting better now and I want to share that with more people, so that they can see that life can be good to you, that loneliness the empty feeling isn’t gonna swallow you or make you worth less than others. And that what you are in school or what you were to people where you live doesn’t define your whole life or your future as a person. What do you guys like to do alone for fun? Comment please, I can add you back.. My hobbies are acting and singing I’m about to be in a short film this year and I’ll be travelling in february so I’ll try to post daily. Check out my reddit page too if you want to see what I’m about, if it interests you
