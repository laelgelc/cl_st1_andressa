Anyone else noticing this? On social media, you often see people that are making the best of their life’s (especially women from my experience) You see how much meaningful social moments they have and the great social networks they have. This is a burden to me personally,

Social media makes me feel unwanted and invisible. I see how much people on there socialize, but i always felt like i’d never be accepted there, just like irl. Those people don’t even know I exist. Sometimes I just wonder why I can’t have a happy, meaningful life like that. What makes me less deserving of meaningful connections and activities than those people? Why do they get support and attention spontaneously, while i have to actively maintain everything or else it dries out. It just feels unfair and it’s hard to deal with this FOMO.
