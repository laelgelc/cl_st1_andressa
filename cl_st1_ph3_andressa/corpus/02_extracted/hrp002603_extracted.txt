When I was a still a child, my father got into an accident due to which he is unable to work but we still get the money from the government. I feel that my mother should have worked and then atleast we could atleast live a dignified life as opposed to the misery we have been through and the burden felt by me because I have basically lived my entire life on the money of the govt when that money could be put to good use.
