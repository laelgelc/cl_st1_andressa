I hardly ever post on Reddit. I'm mainly just a lurker. Lately, I've been having a nagging question:
Is it normal to be a lonely loner? I'm fine most of the time but, as my SO works more and more and I'm stuck at home with our very energetic toddler when I don't have to work, I can't help by ask myself, " why are you like this?!". I literally have no one. Just to be able to text atleast one person from time to time would do some justice but when I do find someone, I usually avoid them? Why? I have no idea. But this just can't be life. I just don't understand .
