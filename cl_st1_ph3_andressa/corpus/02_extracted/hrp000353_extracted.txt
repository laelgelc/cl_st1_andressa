When plants need water,

they do not protest the sky.

They wait...

through days, months,

sometimes years.

No panic lives in their leaves.

No begging rises from their roots.

They release what they cannot sustain

and devote themselves

to what truly matters.

In scarcity, they choose.

In silence, they persist.

Every dry day

presses their roots deeper...

They do not ask why.

They do not complain.

They simply become stronger

where no one is looking.

Perhaps they die...

yet even then,

they do not fail.

Their bodies return to the soil,

becoming what once sustained them

.

In quiet decay,

they nourish roots they will never see,

shade flowers they will never meet.

Even in ending,

they participate in becoming.

Nothing is wasted.

Not the waiting.

Not the suffering.

Not the loss.

Even death

knows how to bloom.

Oh, I wish I were a plant.
