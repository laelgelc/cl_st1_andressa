I’m 37F and have never been in a relationship. Every year that passes by makes me feel like it’s never going to happen and that I’ll be alone forever. I hate dating apps and have had a hard time meeting people in person. I’ve tried all of the things - going out, being social, talking to strangers in stores, dating apps. I want to give up but I want to find someone to share my life with. What am I supposed to do?
