There's a whole wide world out there! Sometimes you may feel as if you don't belong or have nowhere to go, but that is far from the truth. Try to explore your city and discover new places you haven't been yet or visit familiar spaces, but with the intention of being present (being on your devices the whole time can actually make you feel lonelier or more isolated than you are. So please leave the headphones behind). You'd be surprised by how many people you can meet if you are intentional and consistent.
