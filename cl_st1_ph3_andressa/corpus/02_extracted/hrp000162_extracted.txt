So i been alone my whole life, my family didn't like me. Girls dont like me for some strange reason and right now my entire friendship group dont really talk to me and have their own lives. The one person I had as a support has a BF now and I feel like I relay on her too much to be my only social contact. So want to find other people to talk to and make friends with.

I love board games; I am a Christian, I watch anime, and I play a lot of tennis. You know someone to talk about life with....hit me up :)
