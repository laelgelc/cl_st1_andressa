One of the biggest fears that I have is the fact that even when I do more things by myself, I'll still feel more depressed and lonely at the end of the day. Which I feel like makes sense, because the more passionate you are about things, rhe more you want to show them to people. Human beings are social creatures right? Then it only makes sense that we feel the need to socialize and be with others.  Its not that we should feel pathetic about it right? It's how we're wired, so to speak. I don't want my friends(when I get friends) to be my emotional crutch.  That's kinda why I wanted to get hobbies, too keep myself busy, but also so that I could be able to enjoy myself without having the need of others around. Because what im doing to find friends doesn't seem to be working, or maybe im just not trying hard enough.  Idk. But im 26, and I dont want to get to 30 or 40, and realize that I never did anything exciting. That I never did some crazy shit that threw me out of my comfort zone(like hang gliding, ziplinig bunny jumping...karaoke). Sorry if this post is nothing but a walking contradiction or if im all over the place. My question is(my fear) is could I still feel lonely after I get hobbies and all that,and try to be more outgoing?
