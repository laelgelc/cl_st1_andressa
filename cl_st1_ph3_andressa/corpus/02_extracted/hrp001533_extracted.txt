I may delete this later since it’s so embarrassing to admit. I moved country because I’m gay and would love to gain more freedom. But despite all, it’s very difficult for me to find friends and dates because I’m neither “cool” nor good-looking. People seem to like me, but I’m never their “person”. In the end, I’m just that “kind foreigner”. What keeps me alive is my sense of duty towards my family and my parents - I do feel a strong attachment to my heritage. But they’re severely disappointed in me because I’m “not normal”. I’m terribly lonely. 

I genuinely hope that I will be reborn in a better position in the next life.
