Well, I've always been a lonely one since childhood who's live revolves into thinking about families. I belong to lower middle class and a close knit society. We used to shift from one house to another because the owners would insist we get out of their homes due to reasons like they want to increase the reason or they just don't like us. So as a kid I used to keenly observe and was made to feel so cautious of everything i do. My siblings well they r too competitive and their outlook kind of seep to me too and I can't take it with a pinch of salt. Unlike many child, all I think of a kid was to have a better life, dignified one. Had very low self esteem. So growing up I could barely make friends:1st I don't like the friends that I can have, 2nd I never get to bw friend with those friends i like. I do have a good friend but I was never satisfied. I want a smart, well to do friend..not just kind and loyal. So I push really hard and has begun to perceive friendship as "friends for benefits" as my siblings told me that nobody is your friend if you don't become someone in live. So I was very insecure and I only realise how lonely i was until I get some of these validation. But I had lost many friends. Even now I feel so lonely because I don't get to be around people I like.even now I do have friends but just not my people type.. and well I also never attend much social events as I have to study always.
