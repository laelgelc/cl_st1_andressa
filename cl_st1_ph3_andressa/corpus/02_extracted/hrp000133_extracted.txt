From the outside I am this very sweet girl who is always smiling but on the inside I know I am always trying to fit in among groups who I know are not my kind of people. Throughout my college life I have been in relationships because of some childhood traumas. It had become my coping mechanism. But because of this I didn't really make good friends. I did not invest much time in my friendships. I used to feel confident that my partner is enough for me. But then we broke up eventually and I was left all alone. I did have some friends but I wasn't really close to them. We just talked occasionally. Then I made a good friend in my post graduation. But I am just a good friend for her and not really a close one. We do talk sometimes but our bond is not like I can go to her in my vulnerable moments. I also do have a nice boyfriend but we're still new(5 months). So I don't feel comfortable enough to be so vulnerable with him. I don't want to be the girl that runs to her boyfriend at every minor inconvenience just because she doesn't have anyone else. Now when even my post grad is complete I feel completely hopeless. I feel like I will have to live like this forever, without any real friends.
