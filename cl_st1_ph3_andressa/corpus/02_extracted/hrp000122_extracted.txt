How do you go about asking someone for something to chat on? I talk to someone on a certain day a week not every week but most week they live in another state so I don’t see them beside that one day but I like talking to them but I feel like if I ask them if they have any social or number or anything they won’t talk to me again not for any reason they have given me but because it’s the way my mind thinks. how would I ask them for something to chat on during the other days?
