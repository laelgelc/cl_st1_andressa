I,26F, don’t want to continue this life anymore
I want a fresh start
Where i am loved
And chosen
By my parents
By my grandparents 
By my partner
Where I am not such a massive disappointment to everyone
Where I can be myself without being a burden to everyone else
Nothing can set this life right
Each day is a painful - to pretend to talk to people, to friends, to pretend to be happy
I don’t want to do this anymore
I want freedom
