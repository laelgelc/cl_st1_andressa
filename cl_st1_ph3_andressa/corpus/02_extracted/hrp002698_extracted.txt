I'll preface:

For most of my life I had the same circle of friends - we often had a lot of drama between us and I will admit I was part of it a lot of the time - I can't remember the amount of times we'd sworn to never talk to another friend again only to awkwardly pretend nothing happened a few days later.

Well, after a decade, I've finally just broken away from them. It's a mixture of events that transpired - some 'randoms' mocked me online and made youtube videos about me which I discovered to be two friends that I thought were close because we'd never really had any 'full conflicts' like the others in the friendship group. When I found out I confronted them, two of them began to punch me in a half-jokey way, but I knew it was my time to get the hell out.

Well, I did. Then my school was placed on lockdown and now, a few months later, it's my time to head back to my school. Though, my only anxiety I have is that I'm going to be alone now. I'm in a school where everybody knows everybody and I'm essentially acquaintances with most people, though just not friends - mostly because we respect one another but don't have really anything in common. I only have a year and a bit until I graduate and go off to college (I'm in Britain) so I can't bring myself to focus on making any new friends.

My problem is, a lot of my acquaintances often remark when I'm alone and ask me where my usual group of friends are. I don't want to explain anything to them as to not rehash old stuff so I am unsure how to respond. Plus, my year/grade are all kept in the same small chunk of school (as per corona restrictions) so my usual hang out spot will have many people in it who'll notice I'm alone.

How do I divert attention away from myself yet still be alone so I can just do my own thing?
