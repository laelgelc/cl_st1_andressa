Every time i get into a relationship, it’s with the most temporary, uncomfortable making person and it’s like i’m always the boyfriend in the relationship, i’m always  the one giving, the one holding them when they feel lonely or sad, but when it’s my turn it’s like boom your the strong husband no cuddles or belonging for you and i’m single right now and i feel so, so lonely because at the end of the day i just want to feel like i belong, i want to be held by a tall handsome man, i honestly don’t care if they’re conventionally handsome i just want a medium ugly cute guy that’s taller than me, that knows how to cuddle, and warm me up with his words, i want him to write a poetry about me and read it to me, i want to sing him to sleep and cuddle him whenever he wants, i want to bake and cook for him and dance dance to music with him, i want to talk to him and have deep conversations pouring out what we feel, but i just have no idea where to find this because all boys want is sex nowadays but i want a real man.
