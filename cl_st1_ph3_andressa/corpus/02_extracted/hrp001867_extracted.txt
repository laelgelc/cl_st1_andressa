People be like, they show you all the interest in the beginning, make you feel important, make you feel seen… and then one day they just let you drown in their absence.

I don’t understand is it about the interest or the person? Or does nobody actually like anyone in reality? Is everything just masked-up love?

Every time I get attached to someone, it’s like they eventually show me what ignorance really is. And I keep wondering, was that ignorance there from the beginning and I just didn’t see it? Or does it grow with time?

And if it grows… why do people do this to someone who’s most attached to them? Why hurt someone who cared?
