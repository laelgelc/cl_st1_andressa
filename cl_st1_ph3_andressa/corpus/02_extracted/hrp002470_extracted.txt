I won't go into much detail.

43m, worked hard all my life, I have money, I'm on good shape, I look great on paper. The only thing is I have no real friends, I'm not close to my family, and simply put I'm numb to it all. I just really don't care much about anything anymore. To be clear, I was never a jerk to anyone, I just kept to myself and slowly drifted away from everyone.

Thinking of just buying some land far away from everyone else, getting a few dogs, and keep to myself for the rest of my days.

Anyone else in the same boat, or am I just an anomaly?
