Good evening, everyone. I don’t know if it’s appropriate to bring something like this to the group, but here it goes. I’m a very lonely person, and I hardly ever leave the house. I really miss forming connections — not that I have trouble creating them, I actually connect easily — but I miss having people who are available to me at least a few times a day, for a few hours, every day. People think I’m some kind of creep, that I’m always chasing sex or women. That’s not true. I’m just in need of affection. I wish I had someone — a man or a woman, even though I’m straight, gender doesn’t really matter — someone who would check in with me in the morning, “Did you sleep well?”, and at night, “How was your day?”, without the whole “I don’t have time because I work” excuse. You see people opening a discussion on the internet, even here on Reddit, about any mildly controversial topic, and complete strangers will argue for hours. So is it really a lack of time, or a lack of interest? It feels like no one wants to build connections anymore. It’s hard to be a sensitive person these days. And I’m willing to develop something loving with this person too, and to give them my affection, whether they’re a man or a woman.
