I have trauma with women as every girl but one had been a bully or back stabbed me in someway. Eventually I’d like to be friends with more girls, but it’s hard to just feel trusting with them anymore right now. Also I have issues getting alone with people my age in general. I just can never relate, almost every time I meet someone my age I’m just never the right genre. I’m a furry, a home body, I have no job or drivers license, I’m not in school and live in a very rural area. I live with and depend on my father for everything. The only people I get alone with are older men. I’m talking 28+, and I’ve got three friends I talk to, but obviously; they get busy, or are in different time zones. I tried making a post to make new friends, and the only guy who actually messaged me, called me his “baby” within 48 hours. Told me he wanted me to move in. Why? Why is it so hard to find a guy friend who’s older, and just actually have them as a friend? I’m sure it’s because I have a shit relationship with my older brother and my father, I’m not looking for a sugar daddy or anything like that. It’s just for some reason older men make me calm. I feel so fucking weird for that too like, I feel immediately sexualized for it. I don’t know, I’m not expecting anyone to actually read this,  but I really would like older guy friends. I’m tired of playing games solo. I’m tired of being in the house because I can’t go anywhere. I’m just tired of being isolated.
