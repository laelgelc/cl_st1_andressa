Lately I've been feeling particularly like a loner, partially due to the whole social distancing BS from coronavirus. Being in high school I've been feeling torn for a while between two sides of myself and I don't really know which I want to win. There is the side of me who wants to play xbox, listen to lofi hip hop and go on Reddit (the side at the wheel right now) and the side of me that wants to play football and baseball and drink beer on the weekends and go to parties and womanize. I can't seem to find a healthy mix between the two, and it's been stressing me out. I thought I solved it but it's back, and I have no idea what to do about it.
