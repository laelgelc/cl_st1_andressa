i havent spoken to anyone in weeks. im truly a good person. i dont know whats wrong with me. do i have to be funny? i dont find anything humorous nowadays. i scroll on tiktok hoping the next scroll will give me something to feel. i stay up every night. i cant help it, i dread the next day. i used to be so bright and happy. what happened. im useless to literally everyone. im to pessimistic for college. i have no future. the biggest pain is knowing that im fully capable of fixing my life, but the writing is on the wall. ill never be fully happy. nobody will ever appreciate me. im damn near doing you know what but im too afraid of my own blood. im a physical healthy person so i probably still got 60 more years of dread. why do i have to suffer? after all my kindness. ive never been rude to anyone, why dont the bullies suffer? the ignorant, the brutish, the disrespectful. they all live happy. they all have people to go to, to talk to. i have fucking chatgpt and reddit. chatgpt is on some hotline bullshit and nobody ever sees my posts. i think im writing this out of insanity. my voice is becoming withered from inactivity, im a wilting rose, and not a single heart would even feel anything if i disappeared. i cant tell if i was made weak or i was molded to be this way. god fucking knew id feel this. god knew i could never be the person i wanted. god thinks hes so funny doing this to me. this is nothing to describe the hate i feel everyday. im the worst
