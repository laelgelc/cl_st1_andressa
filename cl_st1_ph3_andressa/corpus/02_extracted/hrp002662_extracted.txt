I think I'm a loner 'cause I never felt like I fitted in any kind of group. I had friends, small groups in school, but there was a part of me that never connected. 
If I socialize too much, I get tired, and at times, I kinda start disliking people,at times I found them annoying.

I noticed when I was 16 years old, in my birthday when I realise, when my friends did a little party gor me:  "wow, this party sucks. Why can I just spend the day by myself and watch some movie in my room?"
