I have no one left after devoting my entire life to my family. I'm 49, and totally alone. No family left at all.No friends. Living in a dv shelter. I'm completely alone. There is no one that knows me, that I've cherished, cared for, loved...that knows shared history, shared jokes, shared anything left. Everything and everyone is either dead or gone or unsafe to be around. I'm not sure why im still struggling to recover a life. Perhaps in the future ill help others who lost everyone or suffered like I am. Its hard to persuade myself there is the possibility of people to care for, love, cook for, worry about, and share things with. I was meant to play rage and bloom with my beloved family member this summer, I've been looking forward to it, but now they are gone, the apartment is gone, everything gone.
