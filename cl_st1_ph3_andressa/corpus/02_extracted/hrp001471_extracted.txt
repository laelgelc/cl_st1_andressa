I'm a 30 year old man from an hour north of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, rural Western PA. I'm very successful, and work as a field service technician, repairing large machines for a fortune 500 company. I'm pretty well off, have my own place (3 bed, 2 bath), brand new company vehicle (my job is nicer than it sounds), I'm materially set for life pretty much, and I love my job, I did "work on myself" so to speak, and I'm financially ready for a partner. 

I have been single since late 2020 after my ex cheated on me, got pregnant, claimed it was mine the whole time until the DNA test revealed that I'm not the father. 

That definitely left me with some serious trust issues, and only in the last year have I felt comfortable resuming dating. I've gone out on a few dates, but none of them led to anything, can't really blame anyone, just didn't vibe. 

I also lost all of my friends too, the whole situation with my ex led to me being a pretty unpleasant person, and I had a falling out with both of my best friends. They don't want to forgive me, I'm not counting on it, but I at least want to find a girlfriend soon, I'm craving the company of a woman, and I have severe FOMO. 

I really wish I didn't have social anxiety like nobody's business, makes it hard to connect, especially when I'm constantly busy working. I really want to just find someone already, online dating is terrible, and IRL is hit or miss, hopefully someday soon.
