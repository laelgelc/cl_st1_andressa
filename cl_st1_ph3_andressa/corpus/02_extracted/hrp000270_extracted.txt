1- Don't hate me.
2- You can give your own meaning to loner like I am a loner -really- in the way Tennouji Koutarou is. Yeah we know he is far, far away from being a loner, but he is kinda one, he says that too. He is a loner because he has only one close friend at the first and the rest is just people he talks to half-assedly. To be cheerful! Like, I am being rebellious to my own self. I don't even have Kotori and since I didn't search an answer for "What is youth?" question it hasn't been much cheerful lately. So... That's the loner I am! -sobs- 
3- Well, I don't want loners to leave me right now.
