I learned at an embarrassing age that "we should hang out" does NOT mean they want to hang out. I don't understand this. There are pleasantries with people who are strangers/you don't know very well, but I don't understand when people say this specifically. Honestly it bothers me, because not only do they not wanna hang out, in many cases they get irritated at you for trying to make plans. 

I thought I had this all figured out in my head that when someone says that to you during a conversation, they don't mean that. But what I've just had happen is an old friends hit ME up and then say oh I miss you we should hang out. But then when I say oh that's great I'm free next Saturday, suddenly I'm weird??? Literally after I said that the next thing they said was a message that included a lot of "oh ummm" and "lol". Like wtf?? Is this not how conversations go? Like why was I meant to feel weird about this??

It's one thing if someone says that to you if you randomly run into them in a store but this person initiated contact with me??? Like excuse me for thinking YOU contacting ME and saying to hang out makese think you wanna hang out. 

I'm just venting because this shit happens to me and I don't have any friends I talk to on a regular basis. I don't understand what I'm missing. I just feel like giving up and I've isolated myself so much because I just can't take this
