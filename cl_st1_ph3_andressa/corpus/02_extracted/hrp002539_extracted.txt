hi :) 22f



i'm agoraphobic, rarely leave the house. i have an online job. its been pretty hard to make friends.



i've been very lonely, a problem i have is not having someone to say simple things like "goodnight", "how are you?", "howd you sleep". this makes days feel pretty heavy and i dont look forward to them. 



i have panic induced agoraphobia, first i started going places less, then only on weekdays (when i know nobody will be there), and now i've completely dwindled my social interaction to liquor store exchanges. the last time i went out, i had a panic attack at an empty movie theatre. since then ive had nightmares of this reoccuring. i dont know what to do anymore. 



my online job is okay for now, but i need to figure out a new job soon. i dont make much money. 



the last time i talked to a friend was about a year ago. my only social interaction has been with strangers online.



i dont like being sober, i smoke constantly and drink more than my wallet would like me to. going to bed alone has been the hardest. i just want someone to spend my life with. most of my day i find myself day dreaming of random domestic interactions. 



i dropped out of high school very early on in freshman year. i havent been held or kissed in so long. sometimes it feels like a myth that people actually go home to someone they can touch and hug.



made this account for this subreddit actually! i was interested at the fact that other people feel this alone too. thanks for reading
