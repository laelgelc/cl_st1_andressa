Hey, y'all. This is my first time posting in this sub. Does anyone here used to be relatively social before becoming a loner? For my case, although I wasn't the life of the party so to speak, I did remember being a bit social with my friends back in school, but in my teens and later adulthood, I just became less inclined with socializing and making new friends in high school and later college (though it's safe to say I consider them acquaintances) and I was just focused on doing my own thing, though I still kept in touch with my old friends on occasions. I don't know how to explain why I became quiet, but I know I've gotten used to it and I find being alone more comfortable than being with people, because it gives you more freedom in general.
