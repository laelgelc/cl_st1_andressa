Hi fam. I wanted to post this here, in case it helps anyone. It's modelled off Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and is helping me to understand why I feel lonely even when I have friends and company.

Obviously these are my personal needs and won't be the same for everyone. For context, I am neurodivergent, demisexual and a socially anxious extravert.

Anyway, most people seem to hang out on the bottom two levels, lacking real emotional connection, and it just feels so shallow and fleeting to me.

I'm no closer to having a fulfilling social life yet, but at least I understand the issue better now... I'll keep hunting for my people ❤️
