I feel thats the main obstacle. I have no problem talking to random people wherever I am socially. The problem is its only in that moment and its not enough time to actually get to know them and suddenly they're gone from your life.

I realize you have to see people constantly in order for something to happen and it feels way more natural.  The problem is there's only a select amount of people you can choose from at work/school/hobbies and you might not even gel with anyone in those places. I feel like I can't win.
