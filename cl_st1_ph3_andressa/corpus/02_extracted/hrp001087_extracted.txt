One thing i struggle with is wanting to be around other people, doing things with others.

in the sence of once i do something with someone its hard for me to go back or do it alone. a few weeks ago my talk doc asked me to take my self to the movies- something i have never done before, since it was a movie sit and watch it was a little uncomrtable and akward at first but i did it. its like when i go driving and exploring- i like doing it with other people and not by my self. 

  
its hard being your own best friend somwthing my talking doc has told me to do- be my own best friend. since i dont have many physical friends just online. 

  
I want to get better at talking and meeting people in person, puting my self out there physicaly and not just online which i am pretty good at- any advice or things you have done.
