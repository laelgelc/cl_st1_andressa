I have a lot of strangers cross the street or make a wide berth around me on the street. 

I get it, it's a safety thing. I'm a big tall male, and strangers are unpredictable. But it still stings, and makes me feel like im repulsing people away before I've even made eye contact or opened my mouth.

Doesn't help the self esteem and confidence to try and make friends when I feel there's something so inherently wrong with me that even people that have never met me want nothing to do with me. 

Anyone else?
