I plan to take a year off from dating (no boo's, no hookups, no commitments whatsoever). I also plan to refrain from friendships as well. I pretty much plan to love myself and be my own friend before I re-enter that part of life again. Any suggestions on things that would possibly give me a sense of fulfillment as I venture my world alone?
