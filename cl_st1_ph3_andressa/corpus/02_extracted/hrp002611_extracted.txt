Why? Why am I the most content  when I'm on my own? when It's just me and my pets, I find people just bring me so much mental anguish and make me feel so exhausted, Every relationship I've been in makes me miserable, and I don't know why I'm like this I know it's not healthy, but I just really want to be alone. Anyone else feel this way?
