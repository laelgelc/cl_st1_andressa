Alone. 28 years old, recently separated from BM for a second time. 3 kids involved. No car, no place of my own. Sleeping on my alcoholic dad's couch. BM is so angry and petty that im not gonna see my kids today and dont know when I'll be able to. Have nothing to do, nowhere to go, no money, no *positive friends... Merry Christmas
