Hello all, I have deleted all posts and comments on my account to hopefully minimize anyone I know IRL seeing this.

I am feeling very dreadful for my birthday tomorrow, It is my 29th birthday (which I know the older you get the less it matters) but this seems like it going to be a rough one. I have spent the last 4 birthdays away from family cause of the military, I am out now but no one seems to want to do anything with me. I spent last years birthday alone as well because my (now ex) wife left a few weeks before my birthday., (after planning an incredible birthday for her a month before) for a man she met while I was deployed overseas. I think last birthday I was too sad and focused on that situation to even think about the fact I was spending my birthday alone, but now that I am divorced and that's in the past, I am feeling the loneliness this birthday. 

  
I don't even know why I am typing this, I am probably not going to respond to people on here as it just makes me anxious. I think I just wanted to get it out there somewhere, get it off my chest. If the mods want to delete this feel free.
