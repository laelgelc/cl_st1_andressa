I'm a senior in college, 21 years old. I transferred here my junior year and had zero friends for the first semester. I made friends last spring and we got really close and hung out every day. I studied abroad in the fall and we still talked and I made more friends abroad. Now that I'm back at my college, I wasn't able to dorm with my friends and I haven't seen them at all and we barely talk. The one friend abroad I still talk to barely responds to me anymore. My roommates are either never around or we're all just in our rooms. And in classes there's always an open seat next to me even in crowded rooms. I don't get it. I take care of myself, I smell good, I look friendly. I don't get why I can't meet anybody. Why nobody wants to talk to me. It's a horrible feeling when you think you're the problem. Like you're too boring for everyone or too ugly. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 15. Haven't even hugged anybody. No matter what I try I am always alone.
