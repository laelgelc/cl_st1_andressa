This year everybody forgot my birthday. I can't stop thinking about how I no longer have anyone who is truly part of my life. I'm simply exhausted of feeling this way, I'm 23M now and I'm on therapy and I know it's possible to make new friendships and change my situation but it also sucks seeing how I have created a life so lonely. That's all, I'm feeling miserable.
