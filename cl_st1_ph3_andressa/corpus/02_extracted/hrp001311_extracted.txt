I know my post don't make sense to anyone usually but I still have to ask, and it feels so stupid to try and ask, but I figured I may or may not get an answer. I'm not even really sure.I guess my question really is anyone out there who isn't all fucked up on drugs cause i feel like I don't even have a real friends except 2 I guess im trying to find people who want friends that won't lie nd say o no im not here for drugs I have literally lend money or help someone find a fix for them to even drop a single thought about me nd people who I've known for years now nd they know how i am about people I care about but to be treated as a piggy bank nd tell me thats not the only reason you're there until the money is gone nd no one is around for you then I had been right the whole time and everything is fake so wtf i guess for now I'll see f*****, if I do f***** if I don't
