I want to be wanted so bad. That someone will approach me in a library or a park or any kind of event and want to get to know me. But thats just a dream. A fantasy i play in ky head over and over and over again in the hope that maybe someone is out there for me. And seeing everyone around me being with the person they love, seeing strangers walking with their significant other. All the while I have no one, not a single person like that in my life. I think im just going to that one friend who'll never find that person. That all those dreams of being married and having kids and living the dream just will never happen to me. I wish I could be different. I wish I had what they wanted. I wish for alot of things. But I just want to be wanted.
