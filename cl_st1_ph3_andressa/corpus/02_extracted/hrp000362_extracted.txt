I don't think I'll ever find anyone. I don't think I'll ever have anyone in my life who will stick by my side and cherish me. I genuinely like people having, I wish someone wanted to do the same for me. I don't want to be lonely anymore, it's so suffocating when I look at my phone all day and have no one.
