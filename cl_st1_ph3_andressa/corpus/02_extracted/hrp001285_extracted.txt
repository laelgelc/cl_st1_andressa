It's excruciating. As an adult, you can't make friends at work, because it makes things tricky, especially with somebody with a different position than you. You can't let those people know you or they'll screw you over, most likely.

And I'm done with school, so now what?

I go outside. I go anywhere I can think of. 

Discussion and literature clubs are mostly old people.

Whenever I meet a young person, we exchange info, but they never maintain contact online and it fizzles out.

I can't find any community I'd fit. This isolation has been going on for six years. 

Six years of having mostly nobody in my bloody life, no real friends, no bonds, nowhere I could exist as a part of something.

I don't know what else is left to try, I feel out of options, I am sick. 

Maybe I just don't belong in this rotten country. 

I don't know. 

I just need life to happen, when did life stop happening?
