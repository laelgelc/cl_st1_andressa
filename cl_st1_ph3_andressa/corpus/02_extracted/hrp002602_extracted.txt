I am so far fucking removed from the "normal" human perception and experience of the world I feel like an alien.

My social battery, at full charge, is 1%. I love being alone and socializing is the last thing I want to do. I'm just not built for it. I've finally realized that after multiple exhausting, pitiable, laughable attempts to try and be something I'm not, but no more. 

When they see you isolated (no friends and/or no partner), they're so fucking quick to parade you with "hUmAnS aRe SoCial AnImAlS", and "studies have shown the negative effects of living alone and isolation," but guess what? I don't give a FUCK.

Pretty much everything's bad for you in one way or another. I don't care what happens to me; just like the social-life-needing monkeys who are quick to drop "being alone all the time is unhealthy" yet ironically destroy their bodies with booze and drugs every weekend having a "good time;" just like the autophobic schmucks who criticize you for being alone when they go through so much in their relationships. 

Sure we function as a society, but that doesn't mean I have to go and have scatterbrain conversations with everyone I encounter; and ***MAINTAIN*** relationships with others, when I'd rather be working on things at home. People are just way too exhausting for that. Sure being alone has the disadvantage of having no one to depend on when shit hits the fan, but I'm done caring. I take care of myself physically and mentally and manage my own finances and live a frugal, simple life.

It's time I embrace what I am. No more talking just for the sake of talking so I'm not called out for being quiet, no more feeling pressured to talk, no more forced emotional expression when I really couldn't give a shit, no more feeling bad rejecting the invitations of others, and no more questioning my reality anytime I hear someone shit-talk being alone. No more masks. 

I'm silent, I'm deadpan, I'm a listener, I'm asocial, I'm aloof, and most of all, I'm alone.
