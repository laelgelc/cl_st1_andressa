Tried watching a movie last night to cheer me up. Saw that The Addams Family (1991) was on paramount and decided to give it a watch, always loved the movie when I was a kid. The movie was expectedly hilarious like it always is but when Gomez and Morticia would be in the scene displaying unbound levels of love, it reminded me I would never, ever have sonething like that. That im going to die alone in this fucking place and I have to will myself to live every day. Been going to the gym for the past few weeks to lose weight so I can be atleast more visually appealing but who am I kidding, who would want to even look at me anyway. No matter how much weight I lose or how much I work out I'll always be the same loser who can't even get one date with a woman without being ghosted.
