I chicken out at every new conversation. I blocked the numbers of the girls from my residency. My remaining online friends have been spamming me wondering if I’m okay.

I don’t know. I want to have friends. I want to be out of this rut. I want to have people that don’t think of me anymore. 

I want people I hurt. I can’t see myself with others. I don’t know how to talk to others.

And people try to reach out here but I can’t reply. I’m too scared. Too disinterested in talking to other people, and yet I scream and beg for them anyways. 

Sometimes I think being alone this long has left me without empathy. I can’t find a love for my family, the remaining friends I have, myself, how I view each situation. I know if I join something, I will find a way to sabotage it. I can’t do it for I will hurt too many in the way of trying.
