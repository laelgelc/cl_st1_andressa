was forced to drop out of college due to a perfectly bad storm of circumstances and now I can't afford to go back, and even if I could, I could never do anything while living with my abusive mom again(I lived in dorms before). 

I'm about to start my first adult job, but coworkers aren't, and can't be friends, if they want anything to do with me at all. 

I have no friends from college, no old friends from highschool... and like, I don't even know anybody. I genuinely can't think of a name of a person outside my family. 

and at least in college, there's like different clubs and stuff to join and meet new people. as an adult, no such thing, and, in my country/culture, people refuse to talk to anyone outside their friend group like it's a cardinal sin. 

so yeah I'm doomed and I'm thinking about doing the worst because of it tonight. and of course my dumbass refuses to sleep while feeling like this so I'm just doomed like this the entire night ig
