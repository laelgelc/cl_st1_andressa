I was a socially apathetic child. I just didn't have the drive, I still don't as an adult. For a long time being by myself was enough. Recently, over the last three years, I've developed a feeling of loneliness after never feeling it before. I've been rejected all my life, and I don't think it's an exaggeration when I say I'm a pariah. I wonder what's so different now that I think about it. Maybe the othering has gotten so intense that I finally gained the emotion. I was born to hate, I didn't like it, but in private, I thought nothing of it. I think I only get lonely around people, and feel this profound loneliness when I see others effortlessly get positive attention, a thing that has alluded me all my life.

Because of my disinterest in others and bullying, I never developed proper social skills. I never learned to make friends, or how to mask my defects to be appealing to others. I think I want a friend now, but when I try to talk to others online, I can't fight the disinterest I feel or the distress I get from the interaction. It'd be nice if I didn't have to provide value for someone to give me love and attention, akin to that of a loving parent to their child, something I didn't get.
