It's my 5th new years eve spending alone, in room, watching any random videos on youtube while eating chips or garlic breads. I'm so tired of this... 

I'm seeing people at outside, having fun with their friends, loves, families and etc. i get happy for them so much then also remember how lonely i'm.

I wonder when they sleep or just any random time they being thankful for people in their life ? 

Happy new year everyone 🙏🏻
