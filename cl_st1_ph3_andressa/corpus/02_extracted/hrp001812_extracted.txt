never thought i would come to this but here i am
i pretty much live a life all by myself keeping myself busy in work or movies or video games i have no person in my life i can freely talk to yes i do have friends but ut always feel like they talk only at need basis and im not exaggerating 
when ever i feel lonely theres a pain in my chest 
its like someone is squeezing my heart amd pulling it down
i havent dated cant hold conversation or start even roam places by myself (i dont hate actually its peaceful)
but when i go somewhere i see ppl sharing stuff that hurts me and makes me wish i had that
maybe my story not worth your time but i just wanted write 
thank you
