I’m 18 years old(F). Iv recently been having bad bpd episodes and Iv been isolating much much more. I have these friends but they’re much closer to each other than they are me and in my head I know it’s so stupid to be jealous, but it’s also like… no matter what I do I’ll never have my own person. I’m just alone. A room full of people and I will still feel alone. 

I get told all the time that I’m young and I’ll be ok and I’ll find my true love… but what happens when love never comes? That’s a possibility. I don’t want that to happen to me but right now that’s what my life’s sounding like. It’s like people refuse to let me yearn. That I need to be patient and can’t WANT something. But I do. Omg id love to have a nice boyfriend / OR FRIEND who likes me for me. Who tries to know me and I do the same. But instead im told to be strong and just wait… why do other people get it and I have to wait. Whats wrong with me… I don’t wanna be alone. I just want to feel normal.
