I always think its painfully obvious that I'm  lonely but my therapist told me thats part of the reason you're dealing with it and that nobody can tell. Its the craziest thing to think I look fine in other people's eyes because deep down inside I'm  suffering. Guess I'm  that person that you really don't  know what they're  going through and I hate it so much.
