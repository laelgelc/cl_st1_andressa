I like being alone most of the time like for example I just prefer being alone but also at the same time I like being with my friends, yet I still prefer being alone. I’m not introverted since I love to socialise with everyone but i feel like every time I’m with someone I have to turn on my switch and act nice and stuff which makes me like being alone more and rant about things in my head I also have a problem where I get mad over things that are tiny which is when I’m around people so that’s basically why I’d be alone most of time then be in public.
