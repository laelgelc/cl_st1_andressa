Yelling out to the figures that walk amongst me not a single look in my direction. Was I seriously being ignored by people I didn’t know. 

I was Walking down streets of town. It had been a lot Busier than usual, the cars were roaring as they make their way down the streets. I stared longingly into the distance carrying the weight of what had been done; the invisibility I had felt my whole life had now became my reality right before my very eyes. 

My voice now hoarse from my heart aching cries I go to grab the nearest figure; gazing into the the figure Infront of me  full of hope I reach my arm out 

grasping for anyone to notice my distress. My hand going right through the human like figure as if it was only a projection caused me to lose my balance and fall to the gritty pavement lightly scraping my hands.  

Noticing I jump back pulling my hand into my chest wondering what had just Happened. Suddenly this empty feeling almost as if I’m actually alone stranded on an island no one can hear my screams. 

Immediately this feeling takes over and I am left feeling empty stuck longing for someone anyone to notice. Is my life over and this is my punishment? Questions I don’t have the answers to haunting me reminding me that I am nothing more than a ghost to society.
