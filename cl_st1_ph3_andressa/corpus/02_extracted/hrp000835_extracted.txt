Today I lost the last person who truly cared about me. My girlfriend broke up with me, because I objectified her. I regret it so much. I had such a beautiful time with her. She was incredible, but I messed it up because I couldn't control my lust. I'm want to kill myself. I have no one left anymore. My family members are gone, I have no friends, no one. I've lived long enough. I've seen beauty, and I've seen pain and destruction. There's nothing left for me. I want to die. I have nothing left to lose. Goodbye.
