A life of lies, bullying, discrimination, human rejection, pain. Since I decided to be alone I admit was the best decision I ever took. Being alone means protection from others humans, no more pain, no more discrimination, I put rules on my life. However such isolation due to cruelty made me insensitive to pain and careless about rest of humans. We need definitely to be separated and apart from humanity so rest of 8 billions are happy without me and Im happy without them. No more interaction besides when is really needed, no friends, no lies, no pain, no beasts.
