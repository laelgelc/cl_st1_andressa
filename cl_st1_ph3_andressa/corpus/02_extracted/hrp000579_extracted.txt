My boyfriend called it quits over a text about a month ago now, I’m SO miserable. I think about him every day, almost every moment. I hate having to keep functioning and pretend everything is okay, pushing down my feelings to get by. Nothing helps, nothing matters, I hate having to continue living. Therapy doesn’t help, I can’t get help if I don’t want to help myself. I don’t want to be okay with losing people in my life, I don’t want to forgive men for giving me all these hopes and promises for a future that never ends up happening, just to eventually find another dude to do the same with. Where’s the authenticity now? It’s all just words at this point, lies, and yet I keep believing them. I don’t want to keep hearing that I should “learn to be happy on your own” or “you’ll find someone else” - Im SICK of the social acceptance that we can fuck anyone and form a meaningful relationship with them just to lose it and then get over it to try again. I don’t WANT to be happy on my own. I can do things I like, but they don’t mean as much without my best friend in my life. Professionals just don’t grasp this with me and it’s exhausting. While I love the people in my life, I’m sorry - pets aren’t enough. Friends aren’t enough. Family isn’t enough. Hobbies aren’t enough. They just aren’t replacements for the one thing I crave most in my life - intimate, personal, long-term love.

I’m just so fucking alone. I’m so angry, I’m so sad. I hate being alive, waking up, wasting the day, wasting money, fearing the future and financial/independent stability, and then going to sleep by myself again and again and again and again and again and again I’m so OVER IT I’m fucking MISERABLE
