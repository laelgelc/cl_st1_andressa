I'm not really sure if this is where to post this but I figured I would try. I've always had a hard time making and keeping friends but I had this best friend who had been my best friend, J, for 7-ish years. In November we had this new girl start at work and we hit it off instantly and became what I thought was friends. We would hang out outside of work and text all the time and we had inside jokes. Then at the beginning of December I found out that she was trying to get me fired. She made up an awful lie about me and got me placed on final warning at work after years of a clean track record. I was obviously hurt by this but I thought I still had my best friend, J, so I was grateful to at least have her. We had a rough patch in December but I thought we were fine after we talked it out and we went out to dinner and had a good time just before New Year's. But for the last month or so J won't talk to me much. I asked if she was okay and she said her family was having some health problems so I expressed my sympathies and told her I was here for her if she needed anything and I thought we were fine. I've tried talking to her numerous times and she reads my messages and doesn't respond. I have a really great opportunity coming up this next week, I lost a long time beloved family friend to cancer this past week, and work has been h**l on earth and I just want to talk to my best friend. I totally understand she's got her own issues going on and I sympathize with her and I want to be there for her. I'm just feeling really alone right now...

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent.
