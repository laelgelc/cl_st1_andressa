Hello Everyone, 
So, I am a uni grad now working a corporate job. B4 COVID I was unhealthy, fat and depressed but after I got healthier but my depression hasn’t gone. More noticeable if my loneliness, I am more confident than before but I don’t know how to make friends anymore. What affects me more is my inability to get women, I just don’t know how and maybe I’m just being a bum. I have tried to be more involved in events but I tend to feel more lonely cuz I don’t have anybody to be with. I know people but not like anybody  needs me in their company. And my job is affecting me too, I was steps away from taking myself anyway from this world once. Although this is primarily because I know I don’t have a serious social life and I don’t know what to do. I have amazing parents but not having serious friends or a girlfriend sucks and being an only child doesn’t help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.
