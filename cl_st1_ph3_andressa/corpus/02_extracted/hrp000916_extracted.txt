Its just that, I have around 7-8 friends I talk to almost consistently. But when im with them I just put on a fake smile. I laugh when im supposed to laugh, I crack jokes when its appropiate and I act like im having the time of my life. But the moment im not with them the whole curtain just drops. I dont smile, laugh, or cry. I just feel empty, to the point where I question if im just with my friends for a sense of normality, the fear of losing them or to chase the feeling that I once had when I first met them. 

Like today, I was with 3 friends, and I didn't bother putting on the mask. I didn't laugh, crack jokes, or act happy at all. I sort of just sat there and watched if any of them would notice if they'd ask if I was alright. None of them did...

I just dont know anymore. I dont know if I like being alone or its something else. I just dont know
