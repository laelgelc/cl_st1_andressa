I was thinking about high school / early college when staying connected was basically group chats and hanging out. Now it feels like everyone exists in this feed environment where you *see* them but don’t really interact. I don’t even think it’s anyone’s fault. Just feels like the system changed. Do you feel closer to people now, or like things got more surface-level?
