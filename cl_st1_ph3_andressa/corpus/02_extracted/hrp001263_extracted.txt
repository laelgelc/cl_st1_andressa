I’m lonely in a very literal sense. I live alone, and I go days without talking to anyone. No messages, no calls. Just long stretches of silence in my apartment. After a while it starts to feel unreal, like I’m watching my life instead of living it. Around my family, I mask it well. Too well. I show up calm, functional, normal enough that it’s easier for everyone—including me—to pretend I’m okay. I think the topic of my loneliness is uncomfortable for them, so it never really comes up. It’s easier to assume I’m fine than to open something none of us know how to handle. Because of that, I feel like I’m on my own with this. Not abandoned—just unsupported in a way that’s quiet and unspoken. What makes it worse is that I technically have freedom. I’m an adult. No one is stopping me from changing my life. I know what I want to do. I know the steps. And still, I don’t have the courage to do them. That freedom—having full responsibility for my choices—feels like a prison. There’s no obvious obstacle I can point to, so the blame turns inward. I feel like I’m wasting time. Like I’ve failed at something basic everyone else seems to manage. Each day I stay stuck, that feeling gets heavier. I wish I had someone to lean on while I figured this out. Someone who could just sit in it with me so it didn’t all feel like it rested on my shoulders alone. But it doesn’t feel like that’s an option. It feels like it’s up to me—and I don’t trust myself enough right now to carry it well. I still function. I work. I eat. I get through the day. But underneath all of that is this constant sense of being trapped by my own life, frozen by choice, and quietly disappointed in myself for not moving. I’m not posting this for advice or reassurance. I just needed to say it somewhere honest, because holding it in makes it feel unbearable. If this resonates with you, you’re not alone in it.
