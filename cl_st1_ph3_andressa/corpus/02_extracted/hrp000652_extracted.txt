I have friends, but they all moved away, I go to work but still feel like an outsider, I come home to an empty house, on my days off I stay at home just struggling with the fact I don't know what I'm doing anymore and I feel like I've just lost control of everything in my life. I just feel so alone like all of the time. And I never feel like I have anyone to talk to. I've tried therapy, I've tried antidepressants. How do I just convince myself that I am worth it and I deserve nice things, I just feel like what's even the point anymore. My partner moved in with me this year but due to our work schedules I get home to an empty house as they work nights and I work days, I feel like there is so much pressure to do stuff with my life but I just have no idea what I'm doing and it just makes me feel like I'm a failure and I don't deserve nice things. I just don't know what I'm doing anymore.
