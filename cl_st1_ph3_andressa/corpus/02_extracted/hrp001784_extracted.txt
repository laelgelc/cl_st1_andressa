Even in grade school, I was shunned away or ignored by other kids, my teachers, etc. 

I remember the only friend I had was a kind old cleaning lady who would be the only one to talk to me during recess. The other kids wouldn’t pick me for dodgeball or kickball, whenever I tried making friends in art class, the kids would just ignore me and keep talking amongst themselves.

During my teen years, whenever I tried making friends or socializing, people would just keep things very superficial or forget to include me activities. 

No one invited me to a graduation party. Nor did anyone show up to mine.

I never had anyone reciprocate the love or effort I showed them.

This continued later into my life during university as well, where I usually sat alone in the computer lab in the basement of a lecture hall. 

The very first date I ever went on, the girl ghosted me after 3 dates after being excited about the 4th.

I tried therapy and even there, I haven’t had any success. The first therapist I had, said he could not continue the engagement anymore and wished me the best of luck after 5 sessions. The 2nd therapist I went to ghosted me after the first session and never scheduled the 2nd.

My attempts to have a meaning relationship with family members always stays at superficial levels no matter how hard I try to have deeper relationships and connections. Same at work.

At this point in my life, I don’t feel any emotional response toward rejection or being ignored. It’s gotten to the point where I assume that will be the outcome of any connection I try to make with others and I am pleasantly surprised if that isn’t the case.

My only friends are my mother and father.

If you read this far, thank you and may you be blessed. Take care!
