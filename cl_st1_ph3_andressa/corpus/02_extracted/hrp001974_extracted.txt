Basically how to understand loneliness? Is it just being alone, or do you feel lonely even when you are surrounded by other people but still have the feeling that no one truly gets you. 

How is it affecting you mentally, physically, and emotionally? 

I'll start. To me being lonely is about not having anyone with whom you can share your true self. Yes you can do small talk with colleagues, some deeper talk with close friends and family but still none of them will ever know the real you and who you really are. Not being able to share how you truly feel and how vulnerable you are at certain times. 

How does it feel to be rejected again and again by people that you are interested in? How do you get the conviction to try again? Sometimes I feel I'm better off being alone and being comfortably numb instead of opening up just to be rejected. 

While I want to gather the experience of people over 40 as I'm in that same demographic, but everyone is welcome to share their experiences and thoughts.
