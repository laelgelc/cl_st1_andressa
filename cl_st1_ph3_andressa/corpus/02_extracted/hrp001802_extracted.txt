No friends can ever replace the ones I had. I don’t want to give up on the friendships I had in highschool even though they’re waning, if I don’t have those then I have no friends.

I don’t WANT to make new friends I WANT the ones I used to have. I don’t want to give up or abandon the ones I’m trying so hard to maintain. No one will be as good as those ones.

Don’t tell me to just abandon and replace them. I either have these friends or none at all.

Sorry I sound really repetitive but I HATE when people try to tell me to ‘make new friends’ when I ask how to cope with my current friendships weakening
