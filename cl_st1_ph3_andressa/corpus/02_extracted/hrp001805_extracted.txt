Nobody hits up my phone
I refresh my email and it's just bills nothing else 
My mom calls once in a while but that's about it

I don't know what it is but I seem to not be able to carry friendships or keep anyone interested enough to keep talking to me

Feel chronically alone

Looking for some advice on the matter as I'm not the only one who deals with chronic loneliness

There's nothing particularly wrong with me, but I am a quiet type

What do lonely people do to stop being lonely (without coming off as needy) ??
