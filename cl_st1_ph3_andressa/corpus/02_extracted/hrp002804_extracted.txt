I remember when this facebook post used to go around saying something along the lines of, "we're adults, we don't have to hangout/talk all the time to care about each other. Call me if you need me." I have that with my closest friends and I fucking hate it. Granted they all have kids or serious relationships, so a lot of their free time...well doesn't even exist. My best friend has both those factors, and I see her once every 1-2 months on average. For example, the one day I had issues with my car she offered to help right away and came runnin. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that. But if I could trade it for availability and frequent quality time, I would. I don't need people's help and if I do, I would ask my father or something. Same girl bailed on me on my birthday, actually I saw 0 of my close friends on my birthday but hungout with the casual ones. Like wtf??? You know that brand new song title, I think it's "if I ever need attention all I have to do is die," I feel like that's ME LOL. BUT I DONT WANT IT TO BE. I just want to hangout on a Tuesday and eat chipotle maybe go for a walk??? I don't even know what to do about it anymore, I'm 24 and I have pretty much just accepted that I have to do everything on my own over half the time unless I end up in a relationship and my partner does it out of obligation lol. 
Feeling very whiny and jaded about it today, blah.
