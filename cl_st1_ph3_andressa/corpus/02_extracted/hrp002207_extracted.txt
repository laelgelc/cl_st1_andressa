Hey.

Not really sure why I’m posting this, but I guess I just need to get it out.

I’m 24, and lately I’ve been feeling really lonely. Not just “I want company” lonely, but that quiet feeling like you haven’t really done anything meaningful yet.

From the outside, everything probably looks fine. I work, I try, I keep going. But inside it feels like I’m standing still while everyone else is moving forward. Careers, relationships, confidence… it feels like I missed some kind of memo everyone else got.

I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel proud of. Some days it’s hard to tell if I’m actually building something, or just distracting myself from the feeling that time is passing.

I’m not looking for pity or attention. Just wanted to be honest for a second. If anyone else feels like this, you’re not alone. And if you’ve been here before and got through it, I’d honestly like to hear how.

Thanks for reading
