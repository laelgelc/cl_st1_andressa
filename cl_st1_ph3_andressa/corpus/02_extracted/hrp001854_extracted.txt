I hate feeling alone and seeing clips online of friends gaming together having laughs being kind and seeing people dicuss their hobbies without judgement and also hate this time cause seeing couples around my area increases the loneliness but im used to it since i never had a valentine never in school always saw everyone get a rose or specail gram and instead i got rejected
