I wish my culture encouraged or at least accepted honorable self terminus. I mean, after 46 years with almost no friends and 1 significant other(this was an online relationship,  but we net once here for 8 days and once there for 10), its obvious Im a drain on the community. I look forward to the oncoming void.
