hi im 20F and i’ve found myself completely alone. Not because of crazy fall outs with friends or any big issue, mostly mental health and self esteem struggles. i started to really work on myself in 2025, trying to understand why there’s so much distance between me and everyone else in my world. isolation consumed my life for years, and i can see how that’s majorly halted any growth i should’ve made socially. i don’t feel that different from people around me, but when i interact with them it’s like they can sense something’s off about me. i can’t connect to anyone around me, and it’s really starting to hinder my overall well being. i crave community but lack the social skills i guess. i have a couple childhood friends and thats it, i’ve lost all ability to form new friendships.. i broke up with my bf in august and it’s been 6 months of only having myself 

i’m so miserable.
