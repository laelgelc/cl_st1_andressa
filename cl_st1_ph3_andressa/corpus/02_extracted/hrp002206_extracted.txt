What’s the point in life if everyone is just ending up ghosting or leaving you for someone else. Why did I have to end up in a world where everyone has each other and I’m just sitting here wanting to get that feeling of being loved but no all my life every time I’m just outside everybody who’s inside and having all their life be filled with joy.
