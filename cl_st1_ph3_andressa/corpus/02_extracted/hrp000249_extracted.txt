I have a Japanese test in two hours and a part of me doesn’t even want to leave the house even though I know I need to if I want to get better.

Making it a goal to also get back in touch with the psychologist was seeing, even though I’m doubting it’s effectiveness. Some scars simply don’t heal.

I don’t know whether I want to curl up in a ball and die or scream from the rooftops, just let everything boil over and revel in the catharsis of it after the fact.

I feel lonely today, just gotta put on that face again and act like everything’s fine in this pseudo-dystopian world we’re living in…

毎日がむずかしいですね｡でも、頑張って下さい！
