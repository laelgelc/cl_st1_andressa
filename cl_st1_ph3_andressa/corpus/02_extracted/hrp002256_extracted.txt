(23M) I just started texting this girl I’ve known for a while like a sister but always thought because of the way she texts that she didn’t like me. (Takes long to respond and leaves on delivered) but recently told me that isn’t the case.

My problem is that I have had zero people outside of my house to talk to in 7 months and no job just depression, adhd, and Anxiety. So I feel awful when she doesn’t respond despite knowing the truth it doesn’t help.

Anytime we do talk it’s genuine, deep, good conversation but it’s the hours with no response or even 10 minutes when I’m hyper-fixated that cause me to send multiple more messages and I start to get a million negative thoughts that flood in.

It’s stealing my focus and keeping me up at night because it’s sadly the only thing going on in my life worth a damn and makes me feel even worse to think that I’m just 1 part out of 100 of hers.

Any chance anyone else could relate or give advice on irrational obsessive thoughts?

Edit\* Not into her romantically, always thought of her as a sister
