before we get to into it let me tell you a story. i was born in a dreamy world. all the time i thought i could do amazing stuff in the world. one day when i got 20, i decided to start learning music. Suddenly the whole world told me: 
- hey pal, you sure about that?
looked at him and said: yes
- you know that it aint gonna be easy?
-i know
And my life found a new purpose.i had a dream. it took me long to get instruments and when i started learning seriously it took 5 years for me to find myself and get in love with my dream. now im still a beginner but im on that path i always wanted. 
you gotta know that its not easy but you promised that little boy you were before, that you'll make that dream come true. and im trying my best to do that.

this is what this picture represent. its not an advertizement. its personal and deep down there, i think they'll speak to people.
