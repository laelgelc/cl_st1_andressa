I don’t know what’s going on with me lately I just feel like I know nothing not who I am, not what I want, not even why I’m here It’s like I’m living but not really living I wake up go through the day most of times alone and even when i talk to people it feels weird, and it’s all kind of empty.

Sometimes I just sit there and realize I don’t even know what “me” means anymore. Like there’s no real person behind all this, just something trying to keep moving. I try to care about things, but it doesn’t really work. I try to connect with people, but there’s always this wall.

It’s weird because I want to feel something real, I want someone to understand, but I also feel like no one would really care that much anyway. I don’t even blame them.

I don’t know. I just feel like I’m lost somewhere inside myself, and I don’t know if I’ll ever really find my way back. And u know I really just need something cus I feel like I'm losing
