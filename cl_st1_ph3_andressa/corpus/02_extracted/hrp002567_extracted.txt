So I'm turning 21 next week. I recently moved to a new state and I really don't know anyone. My family are all in another state. I have a few work acquaintances but I'm not super close to anyone. I don't know what to do or if I even should do anything. Maybe just go out for a drink and go home? It just seems kind of depressing but I'm not sure what else there is to really do. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated!
