I know I have more than some and less than most, at least in my part of the world. however I've always had an issue getting and keeping friends, more often than not I can keep one or two people around if it's in person but I fail to understand how to talk to someone long term, unless I'm in person with them and they persist. I feel like some people might relate but I know part of it has to do with the fact that since I've grown and turned 18 I've been moving every couple of years at least cause of my job. It doesn't necessarily get better with time for me because everything has just become surface level since the main driving reasons I could make deeper relationships in the past are long gone. I guess in a sense I'm asking more in terms of how to keep a friend rather than just make an acquaintance then just not talk or not get close to them again. actually there's a song that goes with that a bit 

"Time is gold and it only goes by in waves of strangers

Along the way sometimes strangers make your friends"

I'm just drinking a bit and considering my own circumstances
