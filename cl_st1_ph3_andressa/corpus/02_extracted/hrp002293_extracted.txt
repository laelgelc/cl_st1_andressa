 never thought I was a loser, I just kept convincing myself to run away. Every time I messed up, I'd say "not now", "later", "it's the circumstances". Until my life became full of \_laters\_ and empty of now. I lost people who were honest with me because I preferred being comfortable over being real. I'd laugh with them, but alone, I'd feel empty. One day, I stood in front of the mirror and didn't recognize the person looking back. Not because my face changed, but because my intentions did. I realized my biggest mistake wasn't falling, but lying to myself that it didn't hurt. It hurts, and it leaves scars. If you don't face it, it becomes a wound that doesn't heal. Now, I can't fix everything, but I can admit. I can say "I messed up", no excuses. Maybe this admission won't change the past, but it'll change the path ahead. And honestly? It's the first time I felt lighter, not because I'm perfect, but because I'm real.
