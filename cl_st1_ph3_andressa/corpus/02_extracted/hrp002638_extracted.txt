I’ll start: I enjoy being alone because it lets me hear my own thoughts. 

Here’s an example:

Humans are social animals, which makes me think, that being a singular animal isn’t very strong. Like: a pack of wolves is stronger than one; but an equivalent case for the singular wolf is strong, because it can survive as a one, and its competitors as a pack. But in really it isn’t; because a singular is obviously outnumbered by the pack or social group, and one is forced back into a social role in that group. I view it as a weakness to society. And I don’t know why. 

I feel like I’m being swamped by social obligations I never asked for, so long as I be a loner; I push the boulder, I’d Sisyphus myself towards the absurdity. But that boulder, is only larger; that mountain, is only steeper. As I fight against my own identity of being a loner.

And so I hate my own privacy; as much as I love it. It’s a carefully complex issue, being a loner for me, but my position is against I think: Being a loner is a weakness in society. But I love being alone an equal amount.

Obviously this is only what I think. any for arguments for being a loner? 

Tl;dr: sell being a loner to someone. Or sell someone ur life, what do u enjoy most of being loner?
