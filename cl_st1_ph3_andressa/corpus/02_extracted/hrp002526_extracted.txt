Just needed somewhere to share this since I dunnow, feel like the world is playing some sick joke

I am one of the few people in this world that survived a usually lethal infection know as necrotizing faciitis. This infection is nasty enough they dont allow pics of it on Google search, its really ugly

I was put under in a coma for 6 days, ventilator, feeding tube..

After said harrowing ordeal, pets passed away... someone who i thought loved me simply blocks me and leaves, I struggle to trust and its just the feeling of the world kicking me while I'm down. 

I just worry that I'll break one day and not come back.. I don't know how to even deal with this
