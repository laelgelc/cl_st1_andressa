I'm 29 and about to be 30 in April, my  20s were full of lonely days in my room and friendships that didn't last. I used to have hope when I was in my early 20s I'd find my people. Now I'm kinda in a position where I'm starting to have more people in my life but I'm so cynical about how I waited this fucking long to have this. I feel it's too late for me
