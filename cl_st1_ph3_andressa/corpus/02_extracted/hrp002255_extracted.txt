I have tried calling 988 too but I get dissed and no one truly wants to help me out...

I simply want some new friends. My depression holds me back from making new friends in person....

I just need help getting out of my dark thoughts and almost everyone ignores me and the other half ghosts me.

I don't know what to do...
