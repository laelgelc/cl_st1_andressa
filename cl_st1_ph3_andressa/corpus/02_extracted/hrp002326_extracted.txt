Its been months since I feeled this way. Just got back  from the gym, showed and while I was seeing myself in mirror it suddenly hit me (thought). Idk what was it and Idk what to say of that. But i have been feeling kind of down afterwards. listening to some sad songs. and its been 2 hours and I dont think this mood will wear off soon. 

I have fought enough for my peace and I dont want to go back to the times where I used to spend my days in a room listening to sad old hindi songs from morning to night. I hope this feeling fades away with the time I wake up. 

Thank you for reading
I will see you guys in the next post
Bye
