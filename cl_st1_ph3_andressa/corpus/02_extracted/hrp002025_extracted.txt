Hi i am 20 I moved countries for Uni and I have been living alone for a year now and like my life is so quiet , like i go to class , back home , go to work than home . I am working fast food the shifts are so exhausting after every shift i just wish to have someone waiting at home just someone to be there when im just dead .

I dont really like people anyways i made a few friends here but again thing is im just shy and scared to reach out plus i am a bit clingy like if im hanging out with someone i would never want it to end and like i only like certain people , but like overall i have nothing i just do everything alone idk i feel like maybe this is how life is meant to be
