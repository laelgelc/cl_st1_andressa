Hey, are there any girls here with a savior complex? I really need that right now, just for general information. I’m 22. I can draw, do 3D, even make games. But I haven’t left the house in the last two years, so I really need help getting back to normal life. I’ve completely lost the desire to do anything, and it’s fucking not okay with me.
P.S. It’s kind of depressing that most of the replies here come from grown men who are clearly looking for support themselves.
