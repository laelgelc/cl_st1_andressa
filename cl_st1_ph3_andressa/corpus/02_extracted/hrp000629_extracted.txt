Every day I feel like I only live to support others. Every night I feel more alone and lost. I don't even know what I want in life. I can't make friends, the few I did have just faded away and stopped talking. My girlfriend is uncommitted to me and doesn't make me feel wanted, only really talking when she wants something out of it. Just a husk of a person living for others until they eventually don't need me. More tool than human
