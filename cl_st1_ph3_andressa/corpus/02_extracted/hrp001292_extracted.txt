Hey everyone, M24 here. Hope you’re all having a good day, wishing nothing but peace to all my brothers and sisters out there.

Before I start, let me say this: I love women. I genuinely believe they’re the most beautiful creations God ever made. Every curve feels intentional, like real time and care went into shaping them.

That said, I’ve never dated anyone. My DMs are always empty. It’s not that I haven’t tried, I just never got the outcome I hoped for. I can play multiple instruments, I have an accounting degree, and I’m working at one of the biggest firms here.

I don’t know, man. I just needed to let this out. Twenty-four years of loneliness really shows you how different your world can feel compared to everyone else’s.

Thanks for reading g, wishing everyone a good day.
