idk if context is needed but i'm 18. I'm in college rn and results just came out. I got a whopping 2.93/5 for my GPA and to maintain my scholarship, i need to obtain a 4.07 minimum next semester.

for the first time in my life, i am very, very close to failing. and i've never failed this bad before. highschool was filled with As and medals. I don't know what happened to me when I got to my dream university in my dream major. all of it just... evaporated. all of my motivation just disappeared, and i too increasingly wanted to disappear along with it.

i have a lot of people around me. good friends who i can reach out to. my parents. my sister. my boyfriend. counselors and advisors. but i always feel so alone in facing things for some reason. i can't seem to connect with people regarding my mental health, and it has just been declining over the years. i can't bring myself to even mention my struggles in passing. i seem to just wait in silence for someone to notice, even though i know i have to reach out. i have so many people around me and yet i have never felt lonelier.

i dont know what to do. i never failed before. i dont know how to deal with it and how to ask for help. i dont know where i am going. and i dont even know if i have the strength to keep going. i want to cry but no tears come out of me. just endless discomfort and i feel big emotions wanting to come out but they aren't big enough to, and they are bothering me so much that i cant think clearly.

and yet, even with all these struggles, i could not bring myself to be honest and reach out. i am tired.

sorry if this is kind of a rant. i just dont know what to do anymore, and i dont know who to talk to. but i know i have to tell someone to have some space to think and to know what others think..
