I always feel for young girls abandoned by their fathers and wonder how difficult it would be growing up and in the future how will they repair broken relationships.

But as a grown up with decades of looking up to my father as my hero and now finding out he had long years of yearning to be with another woman and was actually willing to abandon us he had the chance back in the day. He now having this stupid online affair because she's married but searched for him when she leaned about my mom's passing. He is speaking ill of my dead mom and her family to the harlot. 

Idk how to feel sometimes.
I hate him, I think I am more of don't care anymore. I just want him to leave me alone but he acts as if I am the one who's wrong and ungrateful. 🤷 

Tbh, I just want my mom to come in my sleep and take me with her, somewhere where there is rest and where there is peace. 
I should go back to sleep.
