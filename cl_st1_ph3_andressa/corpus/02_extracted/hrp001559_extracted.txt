Hello everyone, months ago I had another account but I have deleted it and made the new one which is my current account. Before I was talking to a girl on this platform who actively reads this community it is the only community that she reads and from time to time posts here so this is the only way I can find her to get back in touch with her because I don't remember her username I tried to search for her but I can't find her. I remember that once she published a post here about how no one could dare to be her friend Nicolelo because she is She is unfriendly and she is sincere and honest but the truth is we have talked and she is not as rude as she seems haha. I am not sure if this publication is ok with all the rules but please I hope that the moderators do not work and I hope that this girl is posting and contacts me because it is really the only way to do it the only thing I can say is that she will remember me because I am a girl from Spain who wrote in Spanish and I do not want to reveal any of her personal information for privacy reasons. Thanks to everyone else for reading and a hug for everyone.
