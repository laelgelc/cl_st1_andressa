This week was the culmination of a sequence of events in my life that led me to an effortless letting go option.
My father hates me, my wife betrayed my trust, my debt is sky high and I don't have enough income to pay it even slowly.

I caught dengue yesterday, I have a series of complications that will just let me go if I leave it unchecked.

Just wanted someone to know I'm not able to fight anymore.

Oh, I believe it's called breakbone fever in English.
