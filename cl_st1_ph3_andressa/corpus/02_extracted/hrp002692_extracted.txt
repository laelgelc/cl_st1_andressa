I want to move out from my parents house asap. I'm 17 but in September I'll be 18 so I guess I can do whatever I want and is legal. But even if I think I could make it because I don't need anything special, just food, music and enough money to rent a small apartment where I have water and electricity, people tell me it's not possible. Did you guys manage to be completely independent financially and live alone?
