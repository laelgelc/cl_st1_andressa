Just lonely...

So yeah I’m just really feeling lonely right now and would just love someone to talk to and play the creative response game (I don’t know if it’s the actual name of the game but I just made it up. The actual game already exists since I read about it in a book about stories from Haiti). The game goes as follows and requires two people. Person A gives Person B a keyword. Person B has to answer person A’s questions using the keyword. Person A wins if Person B fails to answer their question using the keyword. Person B wins if Person A cant ask anymore questions. Here’s an example since I suck at explaining things.

Person A: The keyword is Cake. What’s your name?

Person B: Venellope Von Cake

Person A: Where do you live?

Person B: Cakeland 

And on and on until someone loses like its stated above. You can ask all kinds of questions! 😊
