hello idk why im here or what im even posting for but I just feel really bad rn. I got out of a 3 year on and off relationship about a year ago. im not over it I dont think ill ever be, I loved her so much and she doesnt even think of me not at all. she didnt block me but I wrote her this whole essay a few days before new years about how idk I was sorry and that she meant so much to me and I promised to never text again, she never even opened it :( 

its just stuff like tjat I feel like a waste of space and my life often feels like a waste of energy. its really sad and I havent really got any friends either. not any that are there when I need them but when they need me im there no matter when and where, that takes a toll too. im just doing really bad and im just really sad and I dont know what to do with myself anymore I just sit alone in my room in tje dark all day. and I live with my dad and he just doesnt like me, he tells me to go away and get out of his house all the time (im 20) and idk I just really feel hated and like if anything happened to me its debatable if it would affect anyone. 

im sorry for talking so much idk why i did
