Hi, 
I’m a 27F. I’ve been feeling lonely for years. A year ago, I moved to a new country thinking I’d feel more comfortable and happier here but I still feel the same💔
I don’t have anyone here; no family, no friends, no partner, no one. The only thing different from being in my home country is that I have a job but it doesn’t feel like enough. I miss my mom so much but I don’t want to go back home. I honestly don’t know what to do.
I know life exists, but I don’t think I’ve ever really lived it or that I ever will.

That’s all I wanted to say. Thanks for reading.
