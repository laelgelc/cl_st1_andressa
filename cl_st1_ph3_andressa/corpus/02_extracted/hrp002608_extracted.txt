So latley I’ve been wanting to be a loner much in school, just got done with spring break and going on spring break tommorow. Been wanting to just do my own thing to mind my buisness and stay out of any drama or anything, I know I still might be dragged into drama but I wanna be in my own lane kinda you know but away from people.   PS—- my friend group To be honest are people on the PlayStation party that I knew in real life already that don’t go to my same school, some even across the multiple states. Any advice to stay in my own lane?  Like alone and not bothered much. When it’s not class group work or anything like that just to focus on me and my future and passing kinda.
