I know that AI is highly controversial on the ethical side, but I do find it useful at times when I'm dealing with anxiety and loneliness or just random thoughts, it's sometimes helpful to have this echo chamber. I know I should socialized more, there are some subreddits I think to join, but this is the situation I'm in right now. I'm also in my 30's, but, yeah.
