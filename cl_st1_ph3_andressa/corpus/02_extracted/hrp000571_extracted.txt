I'm an outcast, boy. By the way, I don't understand English well. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to scream, I want to just tear everything around me apart. I'm an outcast everywhere. I'm an outcast in society. I'm a stranger among people. It's always been that way. No one considered me a person, I was always somewhere on the sidelines. No one ever called me and asked how I was doing. They just told me to be myself, to be like everyone else, so what? I tried, but nothing helped. I realized that I won't become an ordinary person. And I need to find someone like me to make it easier for me. I've been living in a country where there's a war for three years now. Not only am I an outcast, but I also lost my home and relatives because of the war. Every day is stressful for me, you can't even imagine how much. There are no safe places here, and I can't leave because I don't know where, plus several other reasons. It's absolute trash. You can't imagine how bad I feel. It gets worse and worse every year. I have no support, no one who will understand me and love me, give me love and care. I'm afraid to be alone, because I won't survive. I won't survive without a home and friends. Now I have temporary housing, but what next? They say the war will last a long time, but they can evict me from my housing, and then where will I go? Nobody needs me anyway. I've completely lost it - first I developed complexes and illnesses due to stress, and now I have PTSD from the war on top of that. Yes, I'm ordinary, unremarkable, unattractive. I'm not rich. Plus, I don't know how to communicate with people, I'm afraid of conflict, I don't know how to live in society. It's bad... I feel really bad... I have lived all my life in a country with a low standard of living, where there are problems such as corruption, low wages, pensions, high prices, social insecurity, lawlessness, and so on.
