I pretend to be all strong and nonchalant in front of everyone i know because I don’t wanna let them know just how vulnerable and alone I feel. I flirt with men that I know I will never commit to because I’m afraid of getting hurt. I’m so tired to feeling like this. I just want to feel safe. I hate that I got so hurt in the past and that I still haven’t healed from it. I just want to feel safe for once.
