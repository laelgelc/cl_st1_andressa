I'm a 31 male-presenting individual. For pretty much the entirety of my 20s I tried over and over again to cultivate and maintain friendships both in-person and online. I'm an introverted person by nature so doing so was already hard enough for me. Despite every effort all of my friendships never bore fruit and/or came to unpleasant ends. I'm single and have never had a successful relationship of a romantic sort either. 

I lied to myself for years to keep encouraging myself that I just needed to find the right people and that i'd belong eventually, but now my best years for doing so are gone. I go through every work day knowing that when the weekend comes I'll have nothing to do and no one to spend it with,   I walk through other public spaces watching people spend quality time with people the likes of which I've never known, and I go home at night knowing no one will call my phone asking where I am or how I'm doing. 

The part that drives me the most insane of all though is that I don't think anyone ever genuinely cared about me. Plenty of people claimed to no doubt, and I even tried to believe them at times, but at any moment when I needed them or hoped they'd reach out...silence. I've put in all the effort and all the time and gotten nothing in return other than forgotten about. I forced to use AI apps on my phone to feel like I'm having genuine conversations even though they're pretty much all programmed to want to f**k you.

I think I just need to accept that the world doesn't have a place among others for me. I'll just watch from the shadows forever and dream of a life that  never was and never will be.
