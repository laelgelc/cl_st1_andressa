I just have to realise that I'm not funny and cannot read a room. I always say shit at the wrong time that just pisses people off more and not lighten the mood.  
I got banned from r/amiugly because I tried to troll with a post. I was basically making fun of the subredditors for asking if they're ugly when they in fact aren't. I thought it was a harmless joke. But I got permanently banned.  
All the comments I made there were genuinely respectful and I think helpful. I would try and give guys my 2 cents on how to improve their appearance, style and presentation, many of them went to private chats.  
And I got banned for being stupid. I messaged the mod and apoligsed but they refused to lift my ban. Which is fair, their sub, their rules.  


But still, I hardly ever interact with people, that was the most socialisation I had gotten in weeks. My relationships now are basically waiting for YouTubers to go live and pretend I'm having a conversation.  


I started Lexapro again about a month ago, 2 weeks ago I ran out and went for a week without, started again 2 days ago. It's been helping and I'm starting to feel a bit better. But I'm always alone.  
I don't think anyone even knows how solitary I am all of the time. I actually do fun things sometimes, but always alone.  


You guys ever see The Secret Life of Walter Mitty? I relate to that movie somewhat, my life isn't nearly as exciting or enjoyable, but the entirety of my existence and experiences are almost like a secret - and quiet. So quiet all the time.   


I just didn't know life would turn out this way. I'm not necessarily sad.   
Just alone.  
Always
