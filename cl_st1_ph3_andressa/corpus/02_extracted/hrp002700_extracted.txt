I’m pretty reclusive and have few friends.  I just don’t talk to people due to my cynical outlook.  I don’t think people are motivated by virtuous things.  I think people are more likely to find flaws in others and expose and prey off of that for their own amusement or to cover up their own insecurities.  People just seek to humiliate and degrade others so they themselves can feel better.  I don’t talk to people because, I know if I mess up somehow, they’re just going to antagonize me for it assuming they don’t simply decide to ignore me.  Anyway, I’ve been thinking lately about how people are in relationships and I’ve realized that I’ve never had any desire to be in one.  I’ve never felt love toward another person in a romantic way.  I don’t really feel anything in general these days, but even back when I did I don’t recall romantic love ever being something I felt.  I’m wondering if there’s something missing from my life.  I look descent, I’m in good shape and I take good care of myself, so I don’t think I’d have trouble finding a partner.  I’ve just never bothered to try even once.  What do you think?  What should I do?
