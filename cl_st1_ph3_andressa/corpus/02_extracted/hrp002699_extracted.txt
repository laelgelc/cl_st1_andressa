I do have friends, but I don’t have friends
I think they love me, but I don’t think they do
I don’t know ? I’m just always lost in the thought of them not liking me and me being just a burden when I talk to them about shit ?
I always felt and I’ll always feel lonely
And at this point I’m just stuck between two options
-accepting the reality that no one understands me and that no one really cares about me or really likes me, so I just gotta isolate myself, give up and accept the reality of me being a loner 
-making effort to get closer to people and try to get them to actually appreciate me etc
