i was on a spree looking for a potential partner and a friend, and let's just say that it didn't end well. i invested a lot of my time and effort into building relationships and connections but i just ended up neglecting myself and my school responsibilities. part of me has regrets but also a part of me is grateful because ive survived 2025.
