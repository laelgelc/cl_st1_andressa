Hey my name is Cole I could really use a friend rn some just to talk to

I'm just....I just feel so alone especially since my SH relapse I've realized no one actually gives af. I've been really trying to open up to people since the start of year and I've met two people who I began to trust then they said things, things with the only purpose to hurt me. I tried talking to some of my school mates and well they don't give a shit about me at all they just want to use me and move on. My family life has problems (who's doesn't to be fair)(nothing abusive).

I just need someone to spend time with or at least give me a chance and let me feel cared for a bit I swear it won't be only one sided.
I'm just so tired of struggling alone and would really appreciate it if u would contact me either via Reddit or something else I prefer insta(coulton.05)

Ik most people won't respond and in that case I'm sorry for bothering you and hope u have a great day/night
