The one where you have so many people around but are so full of loneliness? 
I (F23)am a mother of a two year old and my husband (M24) works 6 days a week. 
I am alone most everyday unless I am cleaning a clients house which is the only time I get babysitting from his side of the family. My side offers 0 babysitting because of various reasons. I’ve talked to him about combining resources with friends or family so we could all have some land and not have to hustle day and night. 
He is a Taurus and I am Aquarius. I didn’t believe this shit in the first years but here almost 5 years in I am thinking maybe these start signs have a bit of truth behind them. He doesn’t want to share land. If he does he wants to be the sole owner and be able to kick anyone off at anytime for any reason. And while I understand his position of ownership, I also don’t care about owning the land. If ownership was split, I would just be grateful to have some help. I’m so tired of being the only one that cleans, and takes care of the house. I’m so tired of having just a few hours with him a day and we never get to talk about anything deep. I am craving human connection and maybe my expectations are too high in this society. I don’t want a big fancy house or expensive things, I just want a community with common goals that I can be apart of and not be stressed to the max 24/7. I feel maybe he has repressed certain emotions in order to be able to function in the capital society. But I cannot pretend I’m happy. What do I do?
