Im 35f and ive dealt with really bad lonesomeness before, and its because i lack more people around me to hang out with.
Im very social but Ive had ALOT of problems with anxiety through the years, but Im managing ok ish now👌

Anyways, im sick of ruminating on loneliness tonight, so fuck it! Heres a cartoon strip from the far side. Hope it brings a smile to you all🙂
I guess its my time to play the accordion😝
