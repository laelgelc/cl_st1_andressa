Hi won't say my name so I was in relationship with a man whom I loved so much that it was him everything for me he used to care,love me so much but then after sometimes things started to change he changed be became agitated stoped calling blocked me always I am very sure he don't have an affair or anything but this sudden changes started kill me hurts me abused me verbally so many times I never even knew abt his whereabouts he either kept me in dnd or directly block me if I called him Or threatened me to block or permanently remove me from his life 



These things started to kill me internally because I blind trusted him and overly loved him

I started to beg cry self harm and what not started having panic attacks yaa



But at end when he left me idk what happened to me i switched off my phone when he last texted me broke I didn't argue nothing just smile and single tear dropped then I didn't turn on my phone 

And till now idk what is happening but I am not able to think anything and neither crying 

Why I am so normal idk I am not able to understand what is happening to mee

I saw him infront of me because we live in same area just in front of each other I saw him  smiling and laughing I also smiled seeing him happy but then just hid myself behind door when I thought he was abt to see me

He seemed happy without me in just few days 





Idk what is happening to me but... At the end i still want him but no courage to even turn onn my phone what if he didn't text me these thoughts are killing me 



I couldn't tell anyone what is happening to me bcoz I have no one to tell so 



nevermind I might never get online ever again here after posting this
