I got out of a 4 1/2 year relationship a couple months ago, and it was nice for the most part. My boyfriend was kind to me and I felt loved throughout most of it, but towards the end, I was definitely doing all the weightlifting when it came to initiating a physically intimate relationship. That wasn’t the reason we broke up but now that I’m single, I’m definitely reconsidering how important intimacy and feeling sought after in the future.

I feel like I really let myself go during the course of my relationship. I am trying really hard to lose weight and get fit and feel both physically and emotionally attractive. Because in my current state, in my skin and my body, I feel so uncomfortable that I don’t think anyone I would find attractive would find me attractive. I don’t feel worthy of love or yearning or intimacy…and it’s pretty lonely.

A few years ago, while I was dating casually, a guy told me that I wasn’t allowed to be on dating apps until I hit a particular weight… I ended up losing a shit ton of weight well below the bar that he had set, and my experience with dating was exponentially more successful.

So I know that I have a lot of work ahead of me, but in the meantime, it sucks to want what I want and feel so undeserving of it. I know that that’s not a great mentality to have and that’s also something that I will be working on but the frustration is real and for anyone else going through something similar ..I feel you, it’s a champagne problem but still hard!
