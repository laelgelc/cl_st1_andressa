I’m 18 years old and just graduated highschool a couple months ago. I used to hangout with friends quite often usually multiple times a week. Now I’m lucky to hangout with friends once every month. I usually spend most of my time with my girlfriend and studying at school. I would say I’m an introvert but still outgoing somewhat. What upsets me is the only time I hangout with friends is if they ask to come to my house or if I ask them to do things or invite myself. I rarely get an invitation to anything without asking, and it’s to the point now where I’ve stopped asking at all. I feel like at my age and with the personality I have I should be out partying or hanging out with friends a lot, but that’s just not the case. I did have a lot of friends in highschool and my girlfriend was jealous of me because she didn’t have many friends. But now the roles are reversed, she spends a lot of time with her friends while I spend close to zero time with mine. I don’t understand why I choose not to put myself out there more and ask people to hangout but it’s just not something I do a lot anymore, and most of the time I choose to spend weekends and nights by myself. I just wish people were more attracted to my personality and would want to hang out with me more. Could it be that I’m just a boring person? I don’t think I’m one of those people that peaked in highschool I just feel like I’m not doing as much things as other people and fear I’m missing out on a lot of things.
