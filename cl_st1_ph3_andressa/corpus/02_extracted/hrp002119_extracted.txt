I'm 21. I've lived in a rural part of the southern United States for all my life. In high school I was a depressed loner. I didn't really have any friends, and all the people I actually did talk to at school ended up moving away for college. I'm one of the very few that stayed and, to my knowledge, I'm the only one that stayed here who didn't get into anything illegal and who isn't conservative.

I live in the middle of nowhere - the nearest towns are like 10 minutes away, the nearest towns with anything to actually do are 45 minutes to an hour away. I don't have anywhere to go to make friends and due to my progressive beliefs I don't think I'd get along with other people here.

Life in a rural area isn't really conducive to socialization especially for people like me. I'd like to meet some more people in my age group but there's just none of them here. These days all run together. Constantly just fog. No motivation to do anything and I'm tired all the time.

I work at a hospital like 30 miles from my house. I'll be a nurse in a little while but I can't afford to move anywhere until I've saved up some money. So I've got another 6 months to a year or so here, and I don't think it's going to get much better. I talk to my coworkers quite a lot but I feel like that's different. We're not really friends like that. I've barely spoken to anyone outside of work in months.

Anyone else experienced this? Did anything help, or do I just wait to move to the city?
