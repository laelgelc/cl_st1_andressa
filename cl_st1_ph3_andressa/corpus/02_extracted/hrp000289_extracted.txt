Ok so I know if you go back and read my past posts they’re sad and pathetic so like there’s my case in point…BUT I started talking to a counselor (not a therapist I’m on a waiting list here in my area for that and psychiatry) but she keeps talking to me how I need to think better about myself and speak better about myself. Now that I’m dating i definitely have many people telling me that often as well or that I just put myself down or I’m negative. But I don’t even think about it before I talk (well bc I never think before I speak bc I’m a moron) but it’s how I truly see myself. is it negative yes. but it’s like so normal at this point that I mean it is what it is? Almost like really depressed and hating myself is my base line. When I was at my pcp and we were talking how I answered 3’s across the board (iykyk) and I just told him it’s just my normal so I don’t even care anymore. If I wasn’t so panicked about making money right now I know he would have 302’d my ass. But I’m just trying so hard to catch up and can’t afford missing work. But yea I know people say you have to be a lone until you love yourself but like I don’t think I can. I don’t see these positives people say they see. I really don’t believe they’re real or even there.
