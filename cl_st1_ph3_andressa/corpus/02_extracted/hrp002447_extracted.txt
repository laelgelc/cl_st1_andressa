Years ago i used to be a social butterfly, everyone's around me and everyone knows me, i will not call them friends because they were just people around my age at school.

Then trauma happen, life ruined beyond repair, lost my few friends, that little butterfly also lost her wings.

I just want to be there again, i never felt lonely back then, i was happy and laughing unlike now faking everything, i wish i could get my life as it used to be before, i just wish for my friends to be here again.
