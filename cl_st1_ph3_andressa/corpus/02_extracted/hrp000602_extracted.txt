I’m so done with being a strong, independent woman. Lately, I’m feeling really sick — I have a fever and barely have the energy to get out of bed.. I can’t tell my family because they always overreact and go into panic mode after hearing such things. I’m in a new city, basically with no close friends who can come see me, or even anyone who can send some nice words over text. I feel exhausted having to do all these things for myself, with no one to look after me or take care of me for a few days. I just want to be dependent on someone without feeling like I’m a burden or awful.

Is it me or everyone feels the same!
