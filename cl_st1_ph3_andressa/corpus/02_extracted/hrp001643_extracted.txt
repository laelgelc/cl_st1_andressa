You know I really surprised at how life has turned out for me! I have one child not because I didn’t want more but couldn’t have anymore. I had 5 miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy but God blessed me finally with one daughter. There is nothing that I didn’t do for my daughter! She was my miracle baby. Today she is 33 years old and married. She lives in Georgia. This child has broken my heart! Her and her husband make more money in one year than I make in 10 years. She decided she didn’t think it was important to acknowledge my Birthday this year. It’s not about the money but the thought. She said she didn’t think we were buying each other anything anymore?? I never said that. I’m the only mother she will ever have and she just doesn’t care. She never calls me and I honestly don’t get to see he often. I’m just done being treated this way. I’m still married to her father but being married to him is like not being married at all he doesn’t touch me. I know that’s probably to much unwanted information but my life is so lonely! I just took for granted that I would have some grand kids like my friends but no I don’t think that’s ever going to happen. My mom died 9 years ago of cancer. She was my everything. I always thought of my mom on special days and bought her things all the time. I guess I thought my relationship with my daughter would be as good as my relationship with my mom but no! I love her more than anything but she has always been a selfish person. All I can do now is give it to God!
