Well,in my case,as an introvert,shy and not much talkative dude,i always had the difficulty to keep friends or create deep friendships or relationships,few friends from high school years that disappeared as they grow up improving their personal and lif in general.

I got the sympathy but not something more,i always was the weirdo guy and got the negative gossip behind my back.

Now in 38 yo,after diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder,there is nothing more to wait just that i wiill be whole life time alone,just nobody will care really.

Whatever i've tried so far failed miserably,from therapies or dating apps or hobbies.
