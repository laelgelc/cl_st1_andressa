I feel like I am having one of the hardest times in my life. I just feel like there’s a huge hole. I think about where that feeling is coming from and other then a few family members I really don’t have any deep connections. I feel like no one really knows me or cares to know me more than at a surface level.

Am I just overthinking? Am I stupid for even feeling this low because of that? I feel the most lost I have ever been and I have no one to tell that to…
