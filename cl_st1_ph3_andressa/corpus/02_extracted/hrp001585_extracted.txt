my last post was so misunderstood so i decided to write next one lmao.

i find it so concering that in subreddit where the majority of people is in a bad mental state there are people looking to take adventage of so many other individuals where they pretend that they are also struggling.

idk i was getting so many messages after i wrote some venting post. most of them seemed normal at first but after a while of conversation the qestions were getting so weird and sexuall and when i were telling these people that im a minor they didnt stopped.

I find this so frustrating beacuse it happens so often and its a big deal and i rarely see someone talk about this.
