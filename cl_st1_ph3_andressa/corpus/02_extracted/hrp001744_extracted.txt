I have no body that gives the slightest shit about me. My family likes to play like they care about me when they don’t. Second something doesn’t go their way they start saying the most obscene and terrible stuff possible to me. They like to play this hyper benevolent altruistic people, but that is only front of other poeple. But god forbid I don’t jump when they say jump. 

Second I talk with a smile, they convert the conversation to how much of a failure I am. Then precede to gaslight me about being quiet and not smiling. 

Friends never had those. Not that I don’t try. I will never forget names and stuff you tell me about yourself. I’ll ask you how you’ve been. Look at you with a genuine smile 

While no one will ever remember me or give a shit about me. Not that anyone owes me kindness just because I’m kind. I want to be kind because that’s the person I want to be, but still it’d be so nice if someone wanted me. 

It’d be nice if someone remembered me

It’d be nice if someone wanted to do something with me 

It’d be nice if someone was happy to see me. 

I am so tired. I’ve never had any normal experience. Never got social media cause you get it when your friends on it. Didn’t know most people don’t go to movies alone. Never woke up to text messages in the morning. Never had friends to sit with in lunch 

Maybe I’m just inherently terrible. 

Maybe being liked is too much for me? 

Each day my smile grows thinner, I am so hungry for something. 

Why is it so easy for people to have friends. 

Why is it so hard for me?
