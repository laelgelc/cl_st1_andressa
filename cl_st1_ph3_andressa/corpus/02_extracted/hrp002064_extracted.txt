I have friends, but I still feel so lonely sometimes. I’m intellectually and emotionally ahead of my peers, so I oftentimes don’t quite fit in. They always tell me that I’m a mastermind and mature. Therefore, I get along better with adults bcs I can’t find a teen that loves reading literature and talking about psychology. People mistake my age, especially online, thinking that I’m over 20 already bcs of my writing style etc. Being like this is so exhausting, nobody connects with me truly and I have nobody to have deep talks with.
