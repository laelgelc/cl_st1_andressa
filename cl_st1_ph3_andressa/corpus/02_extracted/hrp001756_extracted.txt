I 16F have struggled with friends for so long. People I used to be friends with hate me now and look at me like a pest. I do think it is my fault for being annoying and stupid but I just don't understand why I deserve to be treated as if I am a disturbance for existing. I would get so sick to my stomach since that is generalized treatment even with people I do not know. For example, I will just be trying to fix my disguistingly frizzy hair in the bathroom mirror and people will call me ugly and call me a "rat". The only way to avoid this is with more makeup but even then it still happens. I just stopped caring about my appearance or at least in comparison to how much I used to since it never stopped. I finnaly got my parents to agree to let me transfer so I am in an online school now but I am still so scared to even turn my camera on and am dreading the fact that teachers may try and get students to interact with eachother. Even my family seems to hate being around me. My brother (17) has had his girlfriend (18) over lately and I would play Mario Kart with them but it became more obvious that I was not wanted there. I do not think I am worthy of any relationships but I just feel empty, and I have become so scared of rejection and hatred that I have been avoiding seeing or speaking to anyone. I even get scared to share opinions online or even comment something positive on a post since I am so scared of people.

The times I have posted on this sub on a different account I got a lot of comments that were obviously from pedos trying to lure in a lonely teen girl, if anyone sees that please report it.
