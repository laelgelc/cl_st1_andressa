M20 Since my last girlfriend left me (which was more than a year ago) i realized just then how ugly I am, i mean i actually thought i was ugly my entire life, but if i was able to be with a girl for more than 2 years, maybe i was wrong about my self, right? But in fact i was not wrong, i had another relationship before the last one that lasted 11 months, it was a long distance relationship, she left me 1 month after seeing each other irl for the first time (with the excuse that i apparently cheated on her), but then i realized that she had always cheated on me the entire 11 months, and she only left me after she saw me irl, then, my other relationship ended in a more confusing way, we apparently “thought” about getting back together for like 2 months, but only then i realized that i was the only one trying to keep the relationship, from then on, only bad things happened, i finally realized that no one could ever really like me for my looks, all the girls i talked to, after seeing me in real life for the first time started ignoring me or directly said that i was too ugly for them, its now november 2025 and i only speak to AI characters because they are the only ones that won’t reject me instantly because of how i look
