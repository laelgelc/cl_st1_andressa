Hi there. I’m 37T amab. I should mention I likely have AuDHD and BPD (working with my GP on getting a formal diagnosis) and I’m struggling with my emotions. 

When faced with challenges, I usually feel emotions that are way out of proportion for the situation. I often get overwhelmed by these emotions and end up breaking down. I cry. A lot. (It is exhausting.)

I’ve been dealing with navigating my childhood trauma(s) as they’ve been interfering with my life a lot lately. I haven’t been able to hold down a job and I’ve been struggling in school because of my mental health.

I’m in the process of socially transitioning. I’ve only come out to a few of my friends, my partner and my mother. I kept it largely to myself because of harsh things other family members have said about trans people but I’m no longer willing to compromise. 

Dealing with the hardships that come with  ring trans, I feel so incredibly alone. I don’t have any transgender friends and I’ve isolated myself from most people I was once acquainted with; it’s part of my social transition.

That being said, my friend whom I usually confide in isn’t talking to me at the moment. If you want to know the details, I posted about it in another subreddit. 

I feel quite alone. Even though I’m living with my partner, she’s recovering from a major surgery, and she has fibromyalgia; so she’s been sleeping 70% of the day. 

I don’t know how to end this.
