I (25f) have recently been separated from my family. It's a long, complicated story and I'm sure I don't have it as bad as lots of other people. Yet when the sun goes down and I can't sleep I realize just how sad I am. Going no-contact with my parents and starting my life over from scratch is so hard. Worth it, but hard. If you're up at this hour (11:15 where I'm at) and you want to chat, send me a DM. I would really love to make some new friends. 💜
