i do online school and i have a job that i work frequently and i have never been more lonely in my life. when i join the meetings online everybody already had friend groups and nobody responded to my messages. when i go to work i have some people i talk to but they wont talk to me unless i talk to them first and i haven’t hanged out with someone outside of work or school in 6 years. all i want is just one person to pay attention to me and want to talk to me. the conversations i have with my coworkers are never more than “how are you, good thanks” and then they walk away or they start talking to someone in front of me and i just have to stand there and listen to them talk while standing next to me not asking me about anything or even acknowledging me. like today there were three of my coworkers standing around me talking about the football game and they literally just talked in front of me like idk how else to explain it but they were all laughing and having fun and i just had to sit there. i just feel terrible i always try and pretend i have lots of friends to make myself feel better and pretend that they care about me but i haven’t had a real friend since elementary school.
