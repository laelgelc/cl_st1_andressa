They may just be an online friend, and we only ever message each other, but I’ve known him since 2013/2014 when we were still in school. They’re the only friend I’ve had for over a decade now cause of my social anxiety. I don’t have any friends IRL. I don’t have any other online friends either, and don’t know how to make them. 

But I feel like he’s just not interested in me anymore. I always have to text first, otherwise it‘ll be at least 2 weeks before he texts me. And when I try to talk to him, he usually just gives me one word replies. I’ll say something and he just says “yup” and that’s it. No conversation like we used to do. 

My social anxiety is pretty bad and I don’t really know how to talk to people, and I overthink a lot, but idk if maybe I’m just not saying enough to warrant anything more than “yup”. I just don’t know anymore. It’s hard for me to think of what to say. It’s even harder when I’m not given anything more than a one word reply. 

It just really hurts. I’m already so lonely, but at least talking to him before would make me feel somewhat normal and human. I don’t want to lose him but don’t know what to do. He means a lot to me but I’m sure he doesn’t feel the same way about me.
