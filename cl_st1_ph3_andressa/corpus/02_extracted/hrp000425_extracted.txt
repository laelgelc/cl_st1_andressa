Hey there everyone! Hope you're all doing well and happy new year by the way.

I'm 41. Never was very popular with society. in my 20's Had two girlfriends in my life. A couple friends, but professionally, I was going nowhere in the city I lived so I had to move out.

  
I kept contact with everyone. Visit them from time to time, but never them. Where I live (still there today) I went out. Try to meet new people, but it never clicked. Tried to date, but was tired of hearing that i'm either short or my income won't follow her (happened twice for this one).

  
Been 5 years since I had a date. Been almost 10 years since I went out meeting a real friend. I just do my things in life. Gym, work, going out for a coffee etc etc and going back to school at the end of 2026.

I realized that I just don't want to try it anymore. That I gave my best shot, but things in life doesn't go the way you always want it to be and i'm at peace with this. Peace doesn't mean that I am happy with the outcome, but I know that the sad part is long gone.
