Hello. My name is Max, I am 27 years old and I am lonely. I felt that way most of my life and I didn’t even realize it. It was something natural to me.

Through my personal journey, I've come to understand how deeply loneliness can affect my well-being. It is like something sucking you energy out of your body.  
  
This realization led me to dedicate my some of my time to researching loneliness and its impact on individuals and myself. My goal is to explore this often overlooked topic and find ways to help myself and those who feel isolated.   
  
Maybe thats a way for me to do something good.

I am reaching out to invite you to share your experiences. Your insights will be very valuable.   
  
Please write your thoughts in the comments or/and write to me directly. Would love to chat with any of you.

Let’s make this world less lonely together!
