hi ?? im not certain about how to use reddit honestly. but i need advice and this seems like the best place. just a little backstory. i'm 16, i have no friends. i really hate this because i crave community and communication so badly. both of my parents are dead, so im kinda dealing with greif while being extremely lonely. i've already graduated high school but i was homeschooled for a year after i left public school. my guardian absolutely hates me, as in she refuses to let me get a drivers license or a job. she treats me as if i'm not even human and acts like i dont have needs. so given that, im trapped at my house all the time. i live in a very small rural town (which has no public transport or even uber). i've tried talking to people online, but it just isn't for me. i want friends that i could do things in real life with. in conclusion, im completely trapped. advice? or am i cooked until im 18?
