I wanna run away from my current life, college, friends and family, and just get off the radar. I want to start anew somewhere foreign but I just can’t. I’m under a scholarship, and if I do that I’ll be in debt for life and if I don’t pay the debt I’ll be wanted all over country. It’ll be impossible to return. I just want to get away from everything and everyone. I just feel so alone and I feel detached from everyone and it feels like no one truly understands me. I just wish I wasn’t so different or difficult or too complicated to deal with. Maybe getting a pet will help me. To finally know the feeling of someone loving me unconditionally and regard me as highly as I regard them.
