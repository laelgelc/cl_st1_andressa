I just developed a habit, I can't trust females. After one accused me of rape. And then my whole life changed. My father found out and then family problems. And then I was forced to spend long time in prison.  That women then said, it was made up. 

Now, I am 20 and I have no job, and have developed ptsd.  I have to live with my sister and her husband. Because my father think if I stayed home I would be a bad influence on my sister. I feel bad...I am this heavy bag my sister is carrying. I can't afford anything. I am just fucked.
