I have no idea why, for no reason I always get ignored at school, it happened since I went into kindergarten apparently, then it continue till elementary, and eventually high school. I did once get recognized at junior high, and it was the best thing ever :). I genuinely hope that one day I will not get ignored again. Maybe that day will come soon. :)
