I have 2 friends, very good friends, I'm really lucky but... If they are gone I understand that I will be alone forever. 

I feel invisible because never in my life has there been a situation where a person himself became interested in me and wanted to communicate, to get to know me better. I have these 2 friends because I met them in childhood, when it was enough to say "Hi, let's be friends." And again, it was I who became interested, it was I who took the initiative. As I got older, everything got even worse. I realized that I myself can't take the initiative because I'm afraid to meet people and communicate. And I understand that no one is interested in me yet. Being in any group, I feel like a ghost that seems to be there, but if it's gone, nothing will change.

Because no one has ever been interested in me in my life, the fantasy that someone would like me, that someone would confess their feelings to me, or even just come up to me and ask to meet me seems absolutely fabulous. So fabulous that it’s disgusting. I just don’t believe that something like that could happen in my life. I still hope that I won't be alone all my life, but again, only if I take initiative in everything.
