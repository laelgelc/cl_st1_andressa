I nearly made friends throughout my life, but it never got to the point of actual friendship. I didn’t have friends as a kid, I said it would be better through elementary, high school, college, post college well into my adulthood. And it never did. It never will. I didn’t want it to be this way, but I have long accepted and have gotten used to it.
