 Hello everyone,

I posted about 2 weeks ago about developing a simple website to help fellow lonely souls out there. The idea was to allow a lonely person to report their loneliness anonymously and share their location on the map so that other people visiting the website can see that there are lots of people across the world going through the same thing.

The engagement was fantastic. There were over 700 visitors and more than 150 people reported being lonely. We actually saw people from all 7 continents - Antarctica reporting loneliness. 

If the website was of any small help or consolation for anyone, I wanted to do more to help out. 

I since added a limited chat function so that people can share why they feel lonely, and how they are coping with it today. People who do not feel lonely can also contribute by sharing their past experiences and leaving suggestions.

I think the first part of overcoming loneliness, or any problem for that matter, starts from recognizing the issue and identifying the factors leading up to the problem. I hope The Lonely World can help people with this first part.

Please feel free to check out the website and share any feedback.
