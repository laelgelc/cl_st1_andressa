So, after nearly 3 years of working on myself, changing my outcomes and bettering my prospects I (M28) opened myself to sharing my life again, and I found someone (F30)who was worth waiting for, we were talking for a good while, we met a few times, we really clicked, but this last meet it all went sideways, her past wasn’t letting her move on, she was with her previous partner for 12 years, married for 3 and then divorced, and I was seen as a guiding light, which I was happy for, as I too saw a guiding light in her for myself.

By the end of this date she was crying in my arms, saying that she’s still messed up from the past, assuring me throughout it wasn’t my fault, but I can’t help but think I am.

I said let’s give it a bit of time and then revisit, and I can’t lie, this week has been hell, I want to check in but I also don’t want to press, it’s a awkward and awful mindset I’m in, but I just want to make sure she is okay.

I guess above it all, cutting all coms made my world feel dark, I’m in a weird state of play of wanting to check in but also give space, I don’t know if I’m also being selfish about the whole thing.

This has definitely been one of the hardest relationship situations I’ve been in, never have i had a strong connection to someone so quick for it to just stop.

I know this is a lot, but putting into words helps clear the mind a tad.
