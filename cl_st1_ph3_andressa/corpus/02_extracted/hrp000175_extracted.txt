I don’t really have any friends to do stuff with, well at least the stuff that I like doing, my bf gets annoyed that I ask him to do it/go with me and always says I need to make friends (like I haven’t tried literally everyone around here only likes to drink, smoke or hunt) soo I want to be able to just do stuff by myself like go swimming at the beach, or go to the nearest town (2 hr drive) and do some shopping or stay at hotel for the night, or just fun stuff, I just have such a hard time being out and about by myself thinking that everyone’s looking and laughing at me even though I know they’re probably not paying any mind, so I end up just staying cooped up inside
