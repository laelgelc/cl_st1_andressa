The feeling of loneliness is slowly destroying me and whatever i try to do this feeling comeback i have no one to talk to i lost a girl i liked i lost a great friend and when i used to be with them i was so happy man but now they are gone this feeling of loneliness is destroying me i kept thinking about them and both of them is just enjoying their life but thing is i was just another close friend to them but for me they were everything. Will this loneliness ever go?  I dont want this loneliness man
