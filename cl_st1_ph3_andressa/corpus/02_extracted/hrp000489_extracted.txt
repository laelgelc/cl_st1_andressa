To be precise I am a single kid and I don't get along with my cousins as well due to family issues and I do have friends but I no longer feel the connection with anyone as if no one will notice even if I disappear except my parents of course bt being alone in another city (3 years now) I suddenly feel like I no longer exist...I don't even know why am I pursuing CA though it's too late now I am already in final and I no longer have the option to turn to something else and I don't even have anything to do anyway...life has become so empty that I started to think there is no meaning even it putting efforts...and no I am not anti social I do hang out with people and get along with them still it only happens if I put efforts and tbh even this is not able to make me feel other way...so is it same for every other single child with no sibling or friends to clinge on?
