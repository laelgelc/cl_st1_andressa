So the title is pretty self explanatory.

I'm lonely with a shitty job once a week, no friends, no social life, no relationship, depression, can't find any other work,

I completed the story and got 100% 3 times and not interested in online. So I go on director mode and drive around, change the weather, walk around, disable wanted levels and go on killing rampages, there's just something so immersive and escaping about being in a virtual world where you can do anything and cause chaos. I just love immersing for Just hours and hours to escape the hell that is my empty life. But at the end of the day I'm still a 20 year old who doesn't have life figured out and Is feeling hopeless and this is the only thing keeping me going.

I know this might sound stupid, some of you guys might shame me for not facing my problems and doing something about it but honestly idc.

Not to mention the game still looks stunning 10-11 years later. I really hope GTA 6 will be this immersive and successful and legendary and hopefully even bigger.
