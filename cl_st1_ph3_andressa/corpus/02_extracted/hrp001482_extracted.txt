Remember how loneliness used to be considered as an 'elderly problem', but these latest numbers from various data studies show a completely different picture.

A large global survey by NIVEA shows that:

* 1 in 4 people aged 16–24 feel lonely
* Only 19% of all adults say the same
* Over half of lonely people can't even ask for help
* Severe loneliness peaks between 15–29 years old
* Meanwhile, adults 65+ report far lower levels (17%)

And you may ask yourself, why would that be the case? When youth is the best time to be alive!

Well, psychologists point this issue to a combination of: a) Superficial social media engagement (Dr. Vivek Murthy: “You can’t scroll through a feed and know someone.”) b) Economic instability c) Hyperconnected but emotionally shallow digital spaces and, d) Individualistic cultural norms that weaken overall community structures

But the middle-age bracket isn't much far behind. U.S. adults in their mid-40s now show more loneliness than their counterparts in Europe or Israel; which can be traced back to a mix of career pressure, caregiving, debt, and limited social safety nets.

The more individualistic and overworked a society becomes, the more disconnected its people feel.

I believe that loneliness has unfortunately become more of a public health crisis at this point, rather than a personal one. And the research points the obvious, that: we need better community spaces, healthier tech norms, and support systems that reconnect people with one another.
