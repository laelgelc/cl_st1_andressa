sometimes I need help too. it's not something serious, but people need to stop ghosting others. personally i am fine with it, but just to reappear when they want some company is pretty rude. i act like it doesn't matter, but it does. sometimes they become a part of your life, and then nothing for months at an end. 

i have childhood friends too, very good ones actually, but they too are busy with their lives, and i respect their space, so it's not like I am completely alone or anything, but yeah things do get lonely sometimes. 

not sure of the point of making this post, but made it anyways. probably can sleep with a lighter chest .
