Hi. I'm 58, retired 2 years ago from being an English teacher. I didn't think it through because the job was becoming so bad that I didn't think of what I would be doing after retirement.  I don't really have a close circle of friends and find myself isolating more and more. I seem to lack motivation and can't really find happiness in the  stuff I used to do.  I struggle with depression and anxiety and not being around people is taking  its toll.  The usual, "get out there and do something, join  a gym,  a book club etc doesn't resonate with me.  I struggle to find ways to pass the time but just end up watching TV or looking for things to join in. I used to have a bunch of friends at work but because of circumstances I've lost them all. I'm looking for help. Not advice per se, that doesn't seem to get me anywhere for some reason.  Maybe just to make connections. Hope someone reads this. Thanks for your time.
