I just feel tired. I feel like everything is out of reach and right in front of me all at once. It feels like I’m frozen and unable to take meaningful action with anything. I push people away and then wonder why no one’s there. I just don’t really know how to form meaningful connections with people. If I don’t make myself the busiest person on earth then I’ll feel overwhelmed, but at least I’ll feel I have purpose. All I feel I’ve done is constantly waste time and make myself feel worse and less connected to other people. I have to constantly remind myself people are just busy and I’m not. That’s all it is. But I’m tired. I’m so tired of letting people walk out of my life that now I just push them to. I don’t know how to get close to people and I feel like I’m backsliding with all the confidence and self assuredness I had. I’m tired of feeling like I did in middle school wanting a scrap of someone’s attention. I’m tired of feeling like I don’t have enough going on in my life. I’m tired of not feeling happy or excited about anything going on because I don’t really have anyone to share it with. I feel hurt. I feel hurt at all the people who I thought would be there for me and just slowly faded out of my life. I’m just really really tired of being on my own and having to convince myself that that’s enough. I don’t let any person in romantically because I dont even know what I want from them even in the short term. I just want to feel respected and they hardly ever make me feel that way. I wanna just be able to call up a friend and tell them what’s on my mind. But I can’t. I don’t feel like I can go to anyone for anything and I’m tired. I am so goddamn tired of feeling alone.
