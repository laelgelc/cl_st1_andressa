I live with family and my only regular contact is my brother. I don’t feel particularly close to him besides in a familial sense… I don’t have any friends, much less someone I can just text about whatever and talk to. I used to have that, even if it was mostly one-sided and I was just a rebound… ugh. My mind is swarming with thoughts and emotions and I can’t talk to anyone. I’m tired of just having random people DM me, asking me to explain my feelings— I don’t need a stranger to vent to. I need a best friend who knows me and enjoys my presence. I don’t have that and so I just kinda recede into my unconscious mind and talk to myself as though I’m my own friend. 
I feel like a total lunatic for doing that but it’s all I have and all I’ve had since I was a kid. Making friends is so fucking hard and I’m tired of it blowing up in my face. 
I had one good year and I should be grateful for that I guess?

I know I should tell all this to a therapist but the whole “you can text your therapist any time for any reason” thing is a luxury I’ve never had. I’ve never connected to a therapist anyway .-.
