Hi I’m new here I never thought I would post in the internet but since it’s anonymous I feel more safe. I’ve always felt alone despite having family. I have no friends and I have no love. I honestly wish I had a boyfriend. I am gay btw so it’s hard to find someone. But I haven’t actively been looking for something in the past year. I just got disappointed and I feel like I gave up on life. I want to try again but I am so scared to fail. I am really scared of being a failure. I am a college student and I feel like I haven’t really learned anything. I am not smart. I struggle. I want to try again but I am really scared to fail. I don’t know what to do. I honestly have thought about dropping out of my college and just getting a job. But I’m scared what my parents would think of me and if they would be disappointed in me. I don’t want to let anyone down but I am just so done. I struggle to learn pretty badly it’s like everything I learn I forget. I honestly don’t want to keep wasting my parents money. They are paying for my college completely. And because of that I don’t want to keep wasting their money on me. I studied nutrition for a year and then I switched to accounting because I didn’t like it, but I honestly just can’t seem to learn as I have a hard time retaining information. What should I do should I go all in and try my best and if I fail I fail or should I drop out I don’t know what the heck to do. I’m also scared to date because I don’t want to date someone and then disappoint them if I end up dropping out of college. I honestly need advice and I am 20 year old male who’s turning 21 in a few months.
