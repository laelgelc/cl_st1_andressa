I am crying rn.  
I must have put it there when I was 13 and was looking forward to growing up.  
I'm over 10 years older now.  
I want to go back.

I am an old ugly man now. He had it so good back then, that young boy. I had my first crush back then. I still never had a gf. I am old ugly man now. There is no saving me anymore because nobody wants to save me and I have given up on trying to save myself.

The plushie is on my bed now.  
Maybe one day I'll throw it in the trash just to feel something again.  
I love you, stranger, I love you, mother, I love you, but this world is only for the egoists and rapists, not for men like me. I am drowning here, drowning, but everyone is too busy drinking and partying and fucking to see or care. I am sorry mother, I am sorry 13-year old me, I wish you could have been shown love by this world.  
I can't stop crying. I just want to be held again.
