Everyone i talk to always have their phones swarming with text messages, snaps and playing games with tons of friends. I always pretend my phone isnt dryer than the sahara desert. I dont know if i really have friends, just people i hang out with time to time. I dont know what im doing wrong tbh its been like this all my life
