I’ve been here 20 years and I still feel like I’ve never had so much as a best friend. I’ve never been in an actual relationship. People will pretty consistently be surprised when I tell them which I guess is flattering but it also just makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong. I always feel like I’m someone’s third or fourth favorite person and I feel like I can’t ever find anyone who can’t wait to see me. I go through phases of my life where I’m genuinely happy being alone waiting until I find that person but I feel like I’ve just been waiting for so long and part of me has started to give up on the idea of finding someone who picks me first.
