Hey everyone,
I  am in my first year of college, and this is the first time I’ve ever moved away from home. I was honestly really looking forward to the holidays so I could go back and stay with my parents for two weeks. I thought I’d feel refreshed and happy being back home.

But after just two days there, my parents started saying things like, “When are you going back? What will you do staying here so long? The rent is being wasted since you’re not staying there.”

It made me feel unwanted, so I decided to leave earlier and went back after 10 days.

Today, when I was talking to them, I told them that maybe I’ll just come home next year during the summer holidays instead of winter or festival breaks. But then they said something that really hurt me  things like, “What’s the point of coming for  one month? The rent will be wasted again, and the train ticket money too. Just stay there and eat from the mess instead.”

I get that they’re being practical and thinking about saving money I don’t blame them for that. But it still makes me feel really sad. My home and my parents used to be my comfort zone. And now it feels like they don’t even want me there.

I don’t have anyone else in this new city  no friends, no one to really talk to and hearing things like this from the only people I have in this world just breaks me inside.

Has anyone else felt something like this? How do you deal with it when home doesn’t feel like home anymore?
