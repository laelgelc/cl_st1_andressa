Hi , 21yr old started a IT job in a city 150kms away from home. Just ended my college and jumped to corporate majdoori. College was fun always being around with friends, but i always feel the absence of personal space. Now I am living in a 150 sqft rented space with less amenities but loving the silence. Now one is watching me . Want some fun and human interaction, go to the office. Want some personal time ? Come back home . Having family responsibilities? Yes . But constantly in the face ? Fuck no . Love the breathing space .
