So I want to start out by saying I’m 17F, and since I’ve entered hs I’ve had a very hard time making friends, I’ve probably only made like 2 irl so far…but only 1 I consistently talk to. 

I’ve tried even online for the past year to make friends, that doesn’t work either. There are like 4 scenarios that’ll happen here, I try to insert myself into a conversation (not rudely) and it doesn’t, it does work but nothing really comes of it, I try to ask to be friends with a person and it doesn’t work, or it does work and week talk for 2 days up to maybe 3 weeks then I never hear from them again. 

I don’t know why I struggle because I thought I was an interesting enough person? My one good friend thinks I’m really funny and loves to hangout with me when she can but I don’t want to bother her too much y’know?  

So I tried to make new friends, bad idea that did not work. So I’ve just been going through this cycle of trying to make friends, it doesn’t work, I get tired and stop, then get lonely and try again, because what else can I really do? I don’t chase anymore because that’s never gonna work. Even in communities where I have the same interests as people, same ole thing. People enjoy my presence but don’t really want to get to know me it seems. 

Even worse, I’ve talked about this very situation on multiple occasions online, and nobody really cared. So amazing. It’s turned into a bit of a self deprecating thing for me now. But still I will try again because what else can I really do? I’d love some advice…

(Oh yeah btw please don’t ask me to try to make more friends irl..nobody really walks up to anyone to ask to be friends anymore, that ended in elementary school..)

TLDR: struggling to make friends, end up getting ghosted/ignored. Need advice.
