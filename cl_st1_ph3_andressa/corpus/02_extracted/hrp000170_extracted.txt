I don't fit into this new society,I'm short , I'm ugly.
I never known love and I'm 28 years old , never had a first love  to understand what is love.
Is life worth living anymore.
I'm like a fossil in this new generation of situationships,hookups and one night stands.
I constantly ask myself,is life worth living anymore.
