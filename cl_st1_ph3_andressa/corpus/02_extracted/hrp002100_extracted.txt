i have friends, but only online. i cant find anybody who understands me in real life, its mostly idiots who dont think things through. i feel very lonely, even though i want to be totally alone. sometimes i would like to be immortal, because logic dictates i wouldnt have feelings. my feelings contradict my thoughts very often. my thoughts are rational, my feelings are not. thats probably why i enjoy philosophy. im great at making friends online (although its difficult to find the people im looking for), but in real life, thats a lot harder. and the people my age are idiots. the ones older than i am are, too. i dont like to insult people, but i wouldnt know how else to describe it. they dont think, they dont see the value in it, they dont care about it and sometimes they just cant think very far. im a teenager, so i'm surrounded by emotional dummies. i dont mean to offend, but again... how would you describe an idiot otherwise? what should i do? i cant think of anything i wouldnt be too timid to do, and i cant think of any online platforms where you can find people of above average intelligence.
