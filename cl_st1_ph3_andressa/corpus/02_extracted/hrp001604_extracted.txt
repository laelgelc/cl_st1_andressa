15 M, While I’m not lonely per say, I mean I have lots of friends, I feel the the only thing missing is that special someone, and it’s kind of sad knowing that nobody really wants me in that way. I just hope that it changes soon. Like school is really taking a toll on me and it really seems like nothing will ever change, it’s kind of compounded by the fact that I can’t talk to females either though, not sure what to do by this point. Even with my friends they are kind of on the sidelines and I only have 2 good friends for the most part. Everyone else is kind of just there. My mother gets mad at me for just about everything I do, and honestly, sleep is the only escape from my living hell. I need someone new in my life, I really don’t care who it is, I just want someone.
