I don’t even know how to explain this without sounding dramatic, but I feel lonely in a way that sits in my chest all the time.

It’s not just being alone. It’s feeling unwanted. Replaceable. Like I’m always the person people pass over, forget about, or leave behind.

I try. I show up. I care deeply. I listen. I give chances. I open my heart even when I’m scared. And somehow, I still end up feeling like I’m never chosen.

Rejection does something to you after a while. It makes you question everything—your worth, your personality, your body, your voice, your existence. You start wondering what’s wrong with you that makes people walk away so easily.

What hurts most is knowing I have so much love to give, but nowhere safe to put it.

I don’t want to feel bitter. I don’t want to close off. I just want to feel like I matter to someone. Like my presence is wanted, not tolerated.

If you’re reading this and you feel the same… I see you. You’re not weak for feeling this way. You’re not broken. You’re human, and you deserve connection just as much as anyone else.

Thanks for listening. 🤍
