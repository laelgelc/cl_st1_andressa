This is a throw away account. I am extremely lonely and depressed by the fact that i dont have any real friendships. I’m sick and tired of the fake friendships. I don’t know how to be a friend anymore i dont know what to do? Why are all my friendships failing? im the very same person they’ve known at first. I dont think i changed.. did they get bored of me? If they did, why were we friends in first place?
