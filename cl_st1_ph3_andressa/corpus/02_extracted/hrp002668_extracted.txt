I found this sub expecting a bunch of people who like being alone but, many posts seem more to do with loneliness. 

Does anyone like being alone? does anyone have plans to make themselves more alone? 

I find that the societal reality is different from my reality and is seemingly for lack of a better word “Toxic”

I know it’s ironic that I’m making this post as I’m trying to find someone like me while boasting about my “hermacy“. With things opening up (again) I’m at a crossroad (again). Do I even want that back anymore? What do I do with myself?
