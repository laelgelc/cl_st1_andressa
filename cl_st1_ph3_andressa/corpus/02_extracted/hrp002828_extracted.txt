All,

This week I edited [our manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wCEAX-oRxZyXqXdjpbVSYvNd6Hl_-EItjuK8siezewQ/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect some of our notes from last week's hangout.  I also created a [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IuIeUc1nJHuFi59pgrwlT2I0XDqRCcxeHHSR5t2JMo0/edit?usp=sharing) for outlining suggestions I have for running/starting a meetup.  Finally, I've drafted a [quick description of our subreddit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10lH7xiQg8k8f7nLXKbeGsLsTKNkExeot/view?usp=sharing) to replace the current one.

Hope to see everyone tomorrow afternoon/evening!
