I’m sitting alone in my car, just trying to breathe and reset my head.
One can of beer. Two cigarettes. Nothing dramatic, just a quiet moment with myself.
Life’s been heavy lately, and this is my small pause before I go home, eat dinner, and sleep it off.
So Reddit, light question in a heavy moment:
Should I finish the cigarette first or the beer first?
And yes, I know neither is a solution. Just a moment.
