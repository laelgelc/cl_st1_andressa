so i have a couple of friends   
most of them are online friends who i've known for a few years   
i noticed that when i dont text first sometimes we dont talk for days which is honestly fine cause u know life gets busy   
but i always treat my friends with care   
i try to understand them when they're talking about their problems and if for example they have something coming up like a test or something i always ask them how it went and stuff   
i try to share their interests with them   
but when it comes to me i dont get the same thing back   
they dont try to understand me so i just dont talk about anything anymore   
when i tell them i have something coming up they dont ask , im always the one who has to talk about it which dosent feel great   
and they dont share my interests with me (which is a bit upsetting but i cant force anyone to do something they dont like)

i've recently changed highschool programs and i told them about it but no one asked me how it went so i decided not to tell them anything unless they asl about it cause i hate feeling like they're not interested   
and the other day i was telling my friend i wanted to switch high school programs to something that will help better prepare me to go to college and major in nursing (which i already told her i wanted to do) so then she asked me (oh so u want to be a doctor?)   
i know people can forget sometimes or they dont share their care the same way i do but it hurts when im the person who always pays attention to small details about them  
am i wrong for not talking to them and should i just accept that my friends arent as caring as i am?
