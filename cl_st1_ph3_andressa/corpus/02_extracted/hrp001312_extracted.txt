I (29F) just feel so lonely. I'm mainly off from work for 2 weeks, which should be fun and should give some time to relax. And I'm using my time: doing some chores in my appartment, reading, going for a walk in the park, etc. But everything feels so empty. I feel like swiping like mad on dating apps, craving for some response from some guy, I don't even care who it is. I just need someone, right now, it feels very urgent. I know it doesn't work like that and I should learn to be able to bear this feeling of being alone. But it really feels impossible right now.
