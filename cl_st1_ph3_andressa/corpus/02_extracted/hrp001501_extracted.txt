Hello

I m not sure why am i decided to post, but i kind of want someone to hear my cry. I think there are people who are much lonelier than me, but just any way. Maybe i deserve a little attention to?deserve just someone to listen. 

I have friends, well i m not sure. Everything is good and nice when I am fine, but when my pain strikes everyone gets so annoyed. They told me that in my face few times. My problems are annoying. They can't stand them. Nobody can.

I am always there for them, I am always listening, but why cant they be for me? No i never waited it from them. I support them because I love them. I just don't understand why that a thing. Why am I have to suffer alone? Am i a bad friend?

I have big troubles with making friends. I never had friends before. And I can't afford any more to find. I am too boring for most of the people. 

I don't feel any connection with my family also. I know they hate me deep in theirs heart. Because i am a fag.

I am thinking about suicide more often. I started drinking, a little yet, but who knows. Yes, i shouldn't need anyone to do my own thing and live my own life, but i can't, I do want to have someone, who loves me back, who listens. I want to be supported too. This is so pathetic. I hate myself for that.

Why am I still not depressed enough to just die
