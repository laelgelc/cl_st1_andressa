I've been lonely for years to come now. Whenever i try to make friends i just look like a fool or dumb. i try to make friends but it always ends before we actually become anything. ive even looked into those stupid yt videos where they say "oh just be yourself and theyll come your way" well where are they? no one i know has the same interests as me. the only time ive had hope was when i was transferring schools so i knew i should get a new class. well when it actually happened there was 1 new kid who literally changed classes the first day. other than that i just have people i dont want to associate myself with. please help me
