So this is really it? Just work, come home, cook dinner alone, eat alone, do a few more things alone, and then go to sleep alone? 

Cooking has been fun for me, lately. But as always, loneliness sucks the fun out of everything. It's no longer fun or something that brings me joy. It's just something that reminds me that I'm alone and I always will be. 

And what makes it even worse is that everyone I know just tells me that it's normal, it's not that big of a deal. Meanwhile they all have significant others that they spend time with at home, and eat together with. 

Nobody cares. It's all just pointless.
