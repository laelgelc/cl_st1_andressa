People have their moods up & down, they treat you according to their mood. If they feel good they have fun with you, if they feel bad they act cold. Even a child has their moods. But isn't ironic that some people like me who has always been down, and we never get mood up.
Just sometimes feel like disappearing, seems like the world is looking anywhere but not at us. PEACE ✌️
