I move to california from another country and that was exactly 3 years ago today. And I’ve done this routine over and over and I’m tired. Wake up in the morning, go to work, go to my 2nd job, go home and repeat tomorrow. And I’m tired of the same shit but different day. Sometimes do laundry and sometimes go buy food at the grocery and repeat.
Why is it so hard to make new friends? I’ve noticed people that I try to become friends with either have their own close circle of friends or are not open to meeting new people. 
I need a woman in my life. Someone who when I return home from work will have some food prepared, I miss home cooked meals and she is eager to see me and ask how was my day. Someone i can ask advice from and have meaning conversations with. I’m kind of an introvert, I tend to stick to myself and I am not outgoing (there’s  your problem right there). And when I meet someone, it takes a while for me to be comfortable with that person before I show my true self. I also go for long walks alone the beach or hike on a trails which are a lot of here in LA. I just wish I can meet someone with the same interests as me.
