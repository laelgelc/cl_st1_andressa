I just don't understand why I feel so lonely.
I mean… I'm not ugly. People show me interest. I sit there and everything feels empty. It's like no one really sees me.

And I can't believe I think this myself, but... sometimes I wish for someone to swallow me whole. Not nice or sweet, but really… intense. Someone watching me, wanting me so badly that I couldn't escape even if I wanted to. I know that sounds sick.

But maybe it's just because I feel this emptiness. Because I feel so incredibly alone, even when people pay attention to me. I don't just want to be liked. I want someone to need me. That I'm not just pretty or nice, but... indispensable.

I know it probably sounds bad and crazy. I can't believe that I want something like that. But it feels real. And I don't know if that means I'm broken or if it's just the most honest version of me I can feel right now.
