Today i've had fits of pacing around my kitchen in a straight line or in random patterns, maybe out of stress or insecurities or something, but i think a big culprit is that i feel guilty when i'm not up and moving for an extended period of time and also the fact that i feel like i have no one to talk to or pre-occupy myself with conversation, i feel like the people i live with don't care truly and that has made me more miserable, what makes it worse is that my birthday's tomorrow (crumby, i know), i'm just so confused with myself- maybe somebody else is too?
