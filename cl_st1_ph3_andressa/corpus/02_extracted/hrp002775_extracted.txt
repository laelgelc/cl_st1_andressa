Im a only child and live in a whole other country away from my family (they feel like strangers that have your own DNA) it’s been just me and my mom since i was born. I never had more than 1 or 2 friends. Im used to being alone and being emotionally independent and enjoying my own company. But since I’ve started going to college and meeting new people it’s been weird because this girl that wanted to be my friend would demand 24/7 attention and would want to have 3 hour phone calls until midnight  and always go out with me ( we got the most different and difficult schedules ever) and i just kinda like my personal space, when im home after college i take that alone time as a break from society and its so comforting to me. But I’d never guess that  being this way would bring me problems with relationships. Like i had to break the friendship with her cause she would throw a fit ever other day about me not being open enough or not giving her enough attention or not calling(i don’t like to build friendships over the phone, i like bonding in person) and she was really nice but i just couldn’t handle it. Am i the problem? Is this going to keep happening? Was this weird?
