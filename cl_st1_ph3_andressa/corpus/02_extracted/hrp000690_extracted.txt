I need to vent. My life is absolutely shit. I literally don't have anyone to talk to. I need some friends. I just recently lost my mother. You ever feel like the world seems to be moving but you are in slow motion.  I am filled with so many emotions in a day. It's exhausting.  Honestly the last 5 years have been pretty bad. My depression is at a all time high. My medication is not working and I am at the highest dose. I need a friend to help pull me out of this. I can't do it alone. I do have people around me but because of certain circumstances I can't really be vulnerable with anyone around me. I am tired. I am so sick of literally everything in my life. I have cried so much I am absolutely sick of it! How did everything in my life get so messed up. I literally feel like I am screaming from the inside...alone and desperately want to get out of all this but how? Where? Is this greif? Depression? I just want to leave this life and start over. I can't take much more.
