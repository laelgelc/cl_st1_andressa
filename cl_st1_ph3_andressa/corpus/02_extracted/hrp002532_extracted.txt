I don’t usually open up like this, but I’ve been feeling really lonely and needed a place to express it.

I’m 24M and I’ve never been in a relationship or experienced emotional closeness with someone. Watching people around me talk about dating and relationships makes me feel disconnected, like I’m missing out on a part of life that seems normal for others.
I’ve tried dating apps, but they haven’t worked for me. Very few matches and conversations that fade quickly have slowly affected my confidence and made me question myself.

I’m also currently unemployed, which adds to the isolation and self-doubt. When you don’t feel settled in your career or personal life, the loneliness feels heavier.

I am trying to improve myself and move forward, but the feeling of being alone doesn’t go away easily. Some days I manage fine, other days the emptiness is hard to ignore.

If anyone here has felt this way before, I’d really appreciate hearing how you dealt with it or what helped you cope.

Thanks for reading.
