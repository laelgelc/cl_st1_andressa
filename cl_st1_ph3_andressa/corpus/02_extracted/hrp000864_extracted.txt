Throwaway because i don't want this type of thing on my main.

I feel like i've been robbed of what are supposed to be my best years. I see people my age and younger going to parties, hanging out with each other and dating, and it just crushes me knowing what i'm missing out on. As they lead normal happy lives i'm sitting in my room alone all day every day for years.

I wish when i was younger i had just bit the bullet and enrolled in public school or some other program, but my social anxiety kept me from it. now that finally have the motivation to put myself out there, i'm starting my senior year and i feel like its too late.

I plan to start a job in the next few months, but i don't know if i'll meet people my age and even then if i'd be able to connect with them. I feel like a total outcast when i'm around other people. like some part of my brain has been stunted 

I feel so isolated. If any of you have been in a similar situation or have any advice on how i can get out there and make connections with people, or advice in general, it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to live a normal life, but right now i find it hard to see a way forward.
