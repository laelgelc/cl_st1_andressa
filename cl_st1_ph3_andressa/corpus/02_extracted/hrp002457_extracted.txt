I should have abandoned this pursuit a long time ago. The idea that I’ll ever be able to be anyone or anything to anybody is laughable. I’ll never be anything other than alone. Everyone I love can go get what they need, what I am incapable of giving them, from somewhere else, and get it better there than I could ever give.

Why do I allow myself to hurt myself like this. I guess I feel like I deserve it. I deserve all the bad things that could ever happen. I deserve to never feel any true happiness, ever. I deserve to have it repeatedly shoved in my face that I’m nothing. And I’ll always be nothing.

And no one will ever look at me as desirable in any way. No one will ever want me. Not really. And why would they.

I will always have no one. I will always be no one.
