I never had friends growing up or spent much time with my siblings growing up. Really all I've had or the few relationships,  Few family members,  and my kids.  No relationship in about 9 years,  no more family members left, my kids well they moved out at 18 never to come back. I have no idea what I did to deserve this life. I hope one day all the pain goes away.
