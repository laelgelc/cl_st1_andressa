Specifically, ones that are beneficial.

For example, i've one of the worst nMothers (narcissist) of all time. See r/RaisedByNarcissists

There aren't words to describe the "abuse" i went thru as a young boy, so better not even waste time trying to scratch the surface.

That said, due to trauma bonding, some reason i always told her my secrets. Like cryptocurrency - i taught her about it in 2013 and i was on welfare. She invested $30k back then, now it's worth over $2 million. I thought she'd help, but even when i was living in my car and ran out of money, she told me to "work at McDonald's or something".

She had $2 million because of me and wouldn't even help get me off the street.

Fast forward to now. I saw a world class doctor constantly praising Vitamin D and it's beneficial effects. We'll finally i got some, and they effect is unbelievable. I was depressed, but it disappeared overnight. I can't recommend it enough.

Anyway, i went and started telling people random strangers and i just don't understand why i get overly excited to share beneficial secrets with people when they don't reciprocate to me.

It's like giving away secrets but i don't understand why i get so excited to divulge to people who couldn't care less about me.
