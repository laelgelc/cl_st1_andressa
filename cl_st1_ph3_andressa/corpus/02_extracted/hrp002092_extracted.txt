I don’t know what to do. I was on a call with my “friends”, I say that cause they tolerate me, but treat me like garbage, and joke around with me, but they are laugh at me, not with me. I used to have this group chat, and I had more than that, but things got complicated, and they told me to list all the friends I have. I only named about 3. So I truly am lonely. And I wish I wasn’t.
