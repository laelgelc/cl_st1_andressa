I feel good in my pain, I think it's becoming a habit? I don't have the words, I just wanted to write something to maybe express what I'm thinking or feeling, but the thing is, I can't really feel anything anymore... 
I wish I could remember what happens at certain times of the day, but it's a complete blank. 
Like I've taken over without really being able to control it, you know? 
Sorry to bother you.
