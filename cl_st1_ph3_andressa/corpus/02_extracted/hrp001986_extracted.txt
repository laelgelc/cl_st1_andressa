I am M19. I don't have a girlfriend, I have 2 best friends, one of which is busy due to his college and the other one lives out of city. Most of the times I feel tired, done with everything. I started to teach in my mother colleague's coaching centre, and I am preety good at teaching.
But something inside me keeps eating me, I am tired ost of the time, i don't remember when was the last time I was happy, i feel like my father secretly hates me and I can't do anything to make him proud, my mother's demands sometimes feels selfish, it never did before, maybe it's the laziness in me.
I had a girlfriend in high school, i sabotaged our relationship because I always thought that I will never be good enough for her, she was a great girl. I find girls flirting with me in college and I like that, but again the same feeling kicks in when I am about to make a move, the fear that I won't ever be able to measure up to her, give her what she wants.
