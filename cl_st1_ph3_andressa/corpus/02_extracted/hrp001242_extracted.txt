Anyone willing/interested in being online friends or something like that with me? I’m 23M from USA, and as for hobbies, it’s maladaptive daydreaming and chatting with people online hoping to get along. Feel free to dm or dig through my profile to get to know me and see my other posts.

Also, most guys I’ve chatted with online aren’t active with me a lot and I explained more about myself on my first post in r/nofriends which is pretty negative
