So I only ever had two best friends in my life which is my friend group including my sister. I ended it with one of them bc she is very toxic to us. But my other best friend did not end it with her because she doesn’t want to make it awkward. I understand that but if my other friend knows that the toxic best friend has always hurts me and my sister, and she hurts her too, I don’t want to be friends with her anymore either. The only reason why I’m still going to be friends with her is only for my sister. If my friend can’t stand up in-front of our toxic friend, then what will happen in the future. And don’t think we never encouraged her or supported her through it. The day we were going to tell the toxic one we were ending it, my friend didn’t come. I don’t want to be in that friend group or be with a friend who can’t stand up for themselves or her friends either. I am also drained from it bc it’s been going on for 6 years. As mean as that sounds I have to protect myself.
Will I be lonely after this with no friends. Yes. It’s either me or her.
