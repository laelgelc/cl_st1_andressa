Recently, I became more and more confident on the idea that I might have depression, but I never got diagnosed. Among the questions, I answered a 10/10 for how lonely I felt lately. 

It is not a problem of being by myself, I do enjoy my own time. But as someone that has never dated, I am starting to feel more and more as an impostor. 

Everyone talks about their relationships, or even just situationships, how do you relate when you never had something like that? 

I am starting to feel guilty, ashamed of my desires, for my need for intimacy. I crave the touch of another human, but also the connection, it’s gotten to the point that I can’t do anything to satisfy myself, because I end up crying. 

Turns out the people I speak most comfortably with are men around 4 to 20 years older than me (20f), it’s concerning. I can’t stop thinking, why? What is the reason that I only seem to be glad talking to them? I have no daddy issues, and no they are not people taking advantage of me, they are professors or colleagues. 

With my best friend, we often joke about how much of a loser I would be if I were a man because of my interests, but to be honest, is there really any difference? I am still a loser even if I am a woman.

The last manga I read was Inside Mari by Shuzo Oshimi, and I related so deeply i had to take some time to think. 

Today I saw someone that used to be my friend back in middle school, I didn’t reach out, neither did they.
