Does anyone else feel obsessive towards anything, characters , people's or something else? . An obsession so intense that u wonder what's the point of living if u can't get it. You probabaly know that maybe u can become better and remove the obsession but you don't want to remove that obsession. You want that thing. Does anyone else feel like everything they wanted was just an illusion snd that u can't get it ?
