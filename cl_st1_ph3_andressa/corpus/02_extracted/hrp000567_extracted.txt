Literally got 0 friends that i interact with irl and it sucks ☹️get 0 texts too and I usually get ghosted after a few days when I try to make a friend online. Been trying to distract myself but, lately i havent been able to stop feel so bad. Im not very handsome, smart, funny or talented and its hard for me to keep a conversation going cause I dont really do anything worth talking about. I dont know why im still here anymore. I wish I was someone else.
