First of all, I am not a native english speaker. So It can be not comfortable to read.

I am 23m in east asia, and I feel a loneliness

I feel I can't make friendship with woman because I have a little ASD and I think they are high nureoticisic and they have different political views (most of them)

Therefore, I feel I can't happily talk with them cuz different intelligence(not every woman but most attractive woman...) And It is really hard to find high intelligence woman in my condition.

I am not a hater of woman, I am a straight

So I feel loneliness from those facts.

How to do...?

Do I have to mask my real thought and feeling for making a girlfriend?
