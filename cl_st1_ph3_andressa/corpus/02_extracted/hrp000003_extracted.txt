This is the first time I make a post on Reddit. I am in high school, I am 18, and I have a small problem. 

Everyone around me seems to have friends they hang out with on their freetime, except for me. Its not like I dont have friends, I do, but I never hang out with them out of school. I do not know what to do, because I feel like its really weird to ask people to hang out with me. I have strict parents, so I think this is the biggest issue. Because of them, I am kinda "scared" to make friends or to hang out. I do not get invited, and I feel like I dont belong anywhere. I am not allowed either. My parents are really scared of people. And they think that all teens do, is to do dumb shit that can put me in danger.

Its so heartbreaking to scroll on snapchat on a Saturday night, seeing that EVERYONE is with their friends or partying, and I am just sitting alone in my room. I didnt care about this before, but lately it has been really bothering me, and its so hurtful. I do not know what to do. I feel like I am gonna feel like this for the rest of my life. Anyone else have this problem?
