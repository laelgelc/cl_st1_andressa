How can I find someone to love me when I don’t actually love myself 
I feel like I am waiting for no one 
I am too scared to ask because i am not worth it
So I put on this smile and pretend 
I walk through this fog going no where in life 
Nothing to show for it 
If I keep this up I will actually become the 40 year old virgin except with no happy ending 


Yet maybe this is supposed to happen 
I am supposed to wait and feel this sadness because later In life I will find true happiness with someone 
Maybe just maybe
