What's your current treat or favorite drink that gets you through the day or makes you feel normal for a moment while you have it?

Mine is currently a hot matcha latte with oat milk from Dunkin Donuts. I have one every time I go to work and it makes me feel okay for a bit. 

I learned that matcha is supposed to have mood boosting qualities and it does feel like it's helping a little. 

Would love to hear what anyone's treat is
