Forgive me if this comes across as ignorant. I am only recently twenty (Male) and I’m also a writer/director so I’m sure that influences my opinion. However. I wanted to share my thoughts anyhow as I feel someone may either agree or take something from them. 

On thinking of the loneliness “epidemic” taking over the world (not male loneliness necessarily but loneliness in general for everyone) I thought of my own. And in that I think there’s a beauty in loneliness. One that each and every person can “tap into” in their own way. Loneliness for me is a tragedy. But i think the true tragedy in it is letting it “go to waste.” and so I want to encourage everyone to become an artist. You can do this in any field. You can treat science as an art or sports, cooking, anything you want. For me I’ll use the “arts” as the topic given that’s what I do. 

When it’s 2am and you feel you cannot even get out of bed. Try and write a line of poetry, or draw a small drawing, write a sentence of a book you may or may not make, take a picture you feel is beautiful even if nobody will ever see it. And none of it has to be “good” because what matters is that you did it. That’s where the beauty lies. Put something into the world. Even if it’s only into your world. This is how we transform the world. This is how we turn tragedy into beauty. Because in my opinion, every drawing, line of poetry or anything you choose can make the our respective worlds and the world around us a little better.

I’m not saying it’s a cure. And feel free to comment and say I’m out to lunch. But it’s something. A little beauty goes a long way. 

Forgive me for being long winded. And feel free to comment or dm me if you need to talk (or if you wanna call me a crazy person😂)

Thank you.
