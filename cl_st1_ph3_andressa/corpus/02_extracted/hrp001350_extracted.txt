When my friends are struggling they have their partners to talk to and they often shut everyone else out because they have someone there. So if we're struggling at the same time I truly don't really have anybody and even if I am feeling good and they're not them not talking to me makes me feel like shit. I don't have a ton of friends. I like having a small group of friends. One-on-one time is really special to me but with that comes the loneliness of when they can't spend time on me. Then the jealousy sinks in that they have partners. I hate being jealous but I truly can't help it. At least I'm able to recognize that my jealousy is just a part of my own insecurities, but I just feel mad and sad and lonely all the time and it's hard. The world has made being lonely and single such a joke. I get incredibly embarrassed when I feel lonely or when I long for a relationship. It doesn't feel fair.
