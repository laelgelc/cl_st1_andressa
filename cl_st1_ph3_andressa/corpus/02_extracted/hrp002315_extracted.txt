I'm a good looking guy. I'm tall. I'm smart. But there's something wrong with me. I'm so insecure. I'm so nervous all the time. People tell me I look good but I hate what I see in the mirror, in the camera. They tell me I have a beautiful smile but I can't remember the last time my smile was genuine. I can't seem to keep friends. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so lonely and alone. I have so many problems and no one to talk to them about. I think I'll die alone.

I thought I had friends but I don't. It's not their fault, they just forget I exist. I'm so stressed. I truly wish I was never born. It's been like this for years. And for years I thought it would change, but It didn't. Now I'm 19, no friends, no memories, no relationships. I'm just existing. But am I really, if no one acknowledges me.

I wish I could go back. I know what to say now, who to talk to, what to do. Maybe if I could relive my life it wouldn't be so bad. I never wanted to be a recluse, I don't know what happened to me. I don't think I was always like this. I just wish I could be normal. I think people judge me all the time. Whenever they laugh I think it's about me. Every step I take has to be conscious so I dont end up making a fool of myself. Maybe it's because I spend too much time with myself.

My brothers are different, outgoing, so many friends. I dont know why I'm different. Why couldn't I be like them. I'm not even selfish. I don't want that many friends. I dont want a huge friend group or to go to huge parties or to be the center of attention all the time. I just want a few genuine connections. A handful of people I can be real with.

I genuinely don't know who I am. I don't want to keep going anymore. I thought it would get better but it just keeps getting worse. 19 years of life, of existence with nothing to show for it. If I died, no one would remember me.
