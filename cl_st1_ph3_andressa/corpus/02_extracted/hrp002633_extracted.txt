I'm a 20 year old(M) I've kinda always been a loner (only child), but I've had some friends in like primary and highschool. For the past while I haven't been in contact much with them ever since I've graduated.

I also keep messing up chances to be with really nice girls because of my own insecurities.

Does anyone know I can stop feeling lonely? Or what I can do to even like being lonely?
