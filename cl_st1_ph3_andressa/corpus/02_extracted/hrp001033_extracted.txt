I can't be the only one experiencing this.



I have hundreds of "friends" on social media. My posts 

get likes. People watch my stories. I'm "connected" to 

so many people.



But if something bad happened right now and I genuinely 

needed someone to talk to? That list becomes very, very 

small. Maybe even zero.



I've been trying to understand this paradox - how we're 

more "connected" than ever but somehow lonelier. Why 

social media creates isolation instead of real connection.



Made a video exploring this (the hidden cost of 1000 

followers): [https://youtu.be/mhPxxiJFWKI?si=K52ld3tW5BvlgPp0](https://youtu.be/mhPxxiJFWKI?si=K52ld3tW5BvlgPp0)



I'd genuinely love to hear your experiences. Have you 

felt this too? How many people could you actually call 

at 3 AM if you needed someone?
