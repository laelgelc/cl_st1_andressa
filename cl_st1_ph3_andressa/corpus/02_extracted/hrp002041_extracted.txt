I dont know what to do like this. I don't know. I just don't know. I don't want to be alone. It hurts so bad. I'm so tired of laying curled up in a ball wrapping my arms around myself because it almost, just a little bit, feels like someone is there. Like I matter. Like I'm special. But I'm not, I know that I'm not, and I just hurt so, so bad. All the time. I want to scream. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know what to do. I just want to be okay. I just want to be real.
