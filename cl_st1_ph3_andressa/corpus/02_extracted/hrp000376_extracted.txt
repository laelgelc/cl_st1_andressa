All my life whether like relatives, school, college. I never made friends they adopted me, they come to me, all the friends I ever had are people who approached. Now I'm working abit far from home( still the same country and state just a different district). And i do call my old friends sometimes but thats like once a week or something either they are busy or i am. There are friendly people here probably but I can't approach random people and make conversation I can't do small talk. I suck at chating, as i type slow and don't check my messages constantly, I'll probably reply by the end of the day. And i also don't know how to make friends online or where and how to find people online.
