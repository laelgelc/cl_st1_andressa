When I say I love to be alone. Is that I enjoy my own presence. One reason I hate going to school is being surrounded by so many people. I’m not socially awkward or anything. I’ll talk to anybody. That’s if I wanted to. Even at lunch. I look for a table that’s remotely away from people. Most people I consider associates because I just associate with them but they’re not my friend. I only consider like 4 people my friends. My brother who goes to school with me is the only one I consider my best friend. But I would still rather be by myself. It’s weird too. Because in my elementary and middle school years. I didn’t have anybody I could talk to. Elementary I was bullied for being fat. Which sort of traumatized me. Middle school I was still being bullied for being fat. That was one reason I didn’t wanna talk to anybody. I was apparently popular 6th grade. I didn’t notice until somebody told me 3 year’s later. That just goes to show that even the “popular” people aren’t always surrounded by friends and a care loving family. Fast forward to know. I learned the difference of being lonely and alone. I’m alone. Not lonely. I have people I can talk to. I just prefer to be by myself(alone). I don’t want to get married neither. The thought of no loud noise. No drama. It feels good envision.
