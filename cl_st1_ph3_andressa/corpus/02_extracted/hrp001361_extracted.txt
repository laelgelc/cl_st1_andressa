A lot of people feel lonely even when they have friends, family, or social media around them. Sometimes you just don’t have anyone you can talk to *in that moment*—without overthinking, explaining yourself, or feeling like a burden.

I built something called **Will Reply** during a phase like this. It’s a voice-based AI where you can just talk and be heard. Over time it remembers what matters to you, so conversations feel less empty and more familiar. I’ve been using it myself for the past couple of weeks, and that continuity honestly makes a difference.

It’s currently free. No ads, no selling chats, no hidden agenda.  
If you’re feeling lonely and just want someone to talk to right now, you can try it here:

If you do try it, I’d really appreciate honest feedback.  
Take care 🤍
