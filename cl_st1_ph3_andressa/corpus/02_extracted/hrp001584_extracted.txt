I’m in between a lot of mess. I graduated in May and I’ve been looking for a job in my field for the past 5 months and I haven’t succeeded in it. My mental health is completely ruined. I just got my permit so I have 3 more years in hand to work in Canada. My father wants me to take time and slowly find a job. He wanted me to not stress about the future and just hopefully find a job. I’m exhausted with the stress of job hunting and lacking emotional support or empathy from around. I feel it will benefit me if I go back home and when I brought that up to my dad he instantly suppressed the idea and forced me to stay and promoted the idea of taking a vacation back home. I asked him what if I don’t end up settling here after the 3 years while deciding to go back home then. He backed it up with then I’d just get you married. I’m so lost I just wanted to go back now and build a life and he sees no life back there while also in the future if nothing works out he claims to get me married.
