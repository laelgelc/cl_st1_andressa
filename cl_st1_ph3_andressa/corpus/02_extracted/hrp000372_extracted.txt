why do people always seem to say that I deserve better or they don’t feel like they’re enough for me (or even anyone)? It makes me feel alone in a way and like maybe i’m too much. They say they really like me or love me yet it seems easy for them to walk away. It hurts and although I know i have God I feel so alone. I’m just yapping right now because i’m hurt mb 😓
