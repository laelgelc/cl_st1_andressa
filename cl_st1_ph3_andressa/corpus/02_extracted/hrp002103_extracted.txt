That’s it. I genuinely just need someone to hug me tightly and be by my side to help me where I need it. Especially now when my mother just died and I’m now in the process of moving with a real possibility of becoming homeless due to the housing crisis in Canada. The only person who has checked in regularly is my mom’s cousin who lives far away who I knew but never was close with but her calls are becoming further apart too. My immediate family doesn’t check in. I’ve made it clear for years I’m struggling and need help but no one’s offered. Not even after my mom passed. 

I’m that person who always has something wrong and struggling but I don’t know my life is supposed to get better and my mental health too when it’s in the trenches and no one wants to help me. I try to fix my mindset to be positive, have hope but everything very rarely ever works out in my favour. My life isn’t good with the occasional bad bump. It’s bad with the once in a blue moon beautiful rainbow of good. I don’t know how to keep doing this when it just doesn’t feel like there’s enough of a good payoff.
