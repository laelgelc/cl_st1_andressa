I'm a 18 year old female. I was born quite shy, and due to some kinetic difficulties I had as a child, I never learned to play and socialize with the others. Instead, I collected rocks and lived in my own fantasy world, soon to be bullied and alienated.

I think I never adopted the social etiquette that is so easily followed by the majority. To this day, I've never gotten fully integrated to the communities I frequently visit and am, in a sense, a part of. Of course, I know what is appropriate and what is not, it's just that so many things do not interest me. I feel like I'm almost performing femininity, like an actor, not a genuine woman
 Talking about everyday topics feels so strange to me, no matter how hard I try to be normal.

 I'd rather talk about philosophy or art, but I guess I'm too boring or just lack at social skills, as people get quiet when I try to streak a conversation. When I find people who would like to talk, however, it feels special, like we are one, like I was at home, but for one reason of another we will part soon. I, of course, prefer solitude, but these moments are special. I am so sure to treasure them in my heart.

It may sound silly, but I do think that the ones who have spent much of their time of developing alone, for one reason or another, are simply a bit different from the others. Perhaps our thinking patterns have developed differently, perhaps the way we process information is different, perhaps the secret lays in the search of mindfulness and insight in relationships. Some people get a bit entitled, calling it intelligence - I'm not exactly sure about that either, I think it's just about the differences inherent to our existence. Of course, people who think in unusual ways may succeed academically, economically or artistically - and perhaps it is due to the way they - or we - were born. While others succeed at social skills, we do so in other topics.
