I am a high school senior, and I have been struggling with my mental health for a while now. However, these past few days have been the worst, and I have never felt more alone. I have "friends" at school, but we're not close enough to share these types of personal things. Every day I get home, and I feel sad knowing that everyone is out there having fun or enjoying the company of others, while I am just rotting in my bedroom or studying for the next exam. I have a lot to do right now, but I just can't shake this feeling I have in my heart. It's like my heart's cracking open by the minute. Anyway, that's not the only thing I need help with. I also like this girl, and she lives very close to me (like not even 500m far). She is the smartest person at school, and I want to be friends with her because she shares my passion for learning and is just more career-oriented than anyone at school. I have been craving that type of connection for as long as I can remember. However, I don't think she likes me much, and she is pretty reserved. What should I do?
