In the past few years I’ve had some traumatic events happen, leaving me very betrayed and afraid of people. Because of this I feel that I can trust no one. 

It’s been 3 years now and I don’t feel the same. I didn’t recognise myself for a long time and feel I have changed. I now have no desire to be around people. 

I want to be alone, all the time. And I am really, really happy this way. No friends, partner, working with others, nothing. I aspire to work for myself for other reasons but it helps me to rely on myself and be happy not having anyone to possibly hurt me again. 

I love having my house to myself, sleeping alone, doing what I want when I want. I also think isolation is a part of healing and being safe. 

I have hobbies, go out and do stuff. But I just avoid people at all cost. 

Does anyone else feel like this? 
Is it a problem?
