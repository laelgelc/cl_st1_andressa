So i really wasn't planning this at all nd I sure the fuck wasn't expecting to be kicked down twice and when I don't understand why did i do something to upset you all to the point where you look at me and you're all gonna act like im not standing there nothing wtf did i do when I was in jail and mom took care of you cause you were pregnant then the same beautiful little girl that I've seen grow straight look right thru me I know she saw me but she looked away from me like if she spoke to me she would never hear the end of a bitch festival from you that is seriously fucked up when you know that my daughter wasn't stolen from me.Not only once but fuckin twice now I am family, you know that those little girls are part of the only thing that keeps me sane if you're gonna take my world from me, you better be ready for the f****** consequences. I will not do a f****** thing. I will accept the simple fact that they cannot speak to me. Due to the simple fact that I have no idea what the f*** it was. I did, but you know d*** well that I love those little girls.
And that even known you're hurting me right now. I still love you too, a******.
You better have a good f****** reason for pulling this b******* and acting like I don't even f****** exist when all I've done is be there for you and everybody else as much as I could be. I'm sorry, my health has not been the best.I'm sorry that everybody's been dying around me.That has not been anything that I want it just happened that way. I'm done being sorry though, so come in this f****** end of this year.If I haven't forgiven you by the beginning of next year or if I haven't forgiven you before the beginning of next year.You best f****** believe the next time you come to me for anything.I don't care what had happened.Do not speak to me as for the little ones.They know d*** well that I won't shun them like you did to me
