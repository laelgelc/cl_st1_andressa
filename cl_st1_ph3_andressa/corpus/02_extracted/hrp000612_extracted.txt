Every year is the same. I never have a genuine friend. I never get any exciting calls/texts. I might have 1 exciting call/text once every 5/10 years and that’s it. This person doesn’t last longer than few weeks. No one ever stays. Unless they’re fking holes who enjoy bullying me. 😒 UGH! Everything is shit! the only things I can get excited about are unhealthy food and impulsive purchases. 😭 Those are the close thing I got to experience hanging out with a friend…
