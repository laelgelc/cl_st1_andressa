Got rejected by a hookup today lmao. Waited for him to text me back with a hope I’ll have someone to talk to finally and maybe I can get a hug but he went home. Has happened a lot of times before. Feels worthless bcs imagine being such an ugly woman that you can’t even keep a hookup. No meaningful relationship no meaningless relationship. All alone. Now taking my anger on myself out by binge eating sugar and burgers. To prove myself that I’m useless human being. Unwanted one.
