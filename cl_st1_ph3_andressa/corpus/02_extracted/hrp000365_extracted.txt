After being dumped in Ireland by an absolute disgrace of a human being and then him turning around and immediately marrying someone else, I found myself in a relationship with someone that I thought was the real deal. A southern boy from Alabama that could actually fix things and was masculine. 2 weeks ago he said he needed space, left all his stuff at my place, and I haven’t heard from him since. I put my whole self out there and I don’t hide things about myself just to get someone to like me. I’m honest, open, friendly, outgoing, and always trying to better myself. So now I’m left wondering is there anyone left? I’m a 37 year old childless woman who keeps meeting boys claiming to be men. When does it stop? American men seem to be a joke and now Irish men as well. Venting to the abyss.
