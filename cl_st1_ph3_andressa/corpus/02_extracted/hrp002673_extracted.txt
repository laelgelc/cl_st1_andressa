Pretty scared at the moment, had a drinking binge last night and I'm feeling like I'm having withdrawal sensations. Like my head, heart and spine is ready to lift off with them ringing ears going on.

Been invited to go to someone's house to watch football, but I'll need to take a taxi there and back, unfortunately taxi services have gone downhill lately as well as other services and they sometimes don't pick you up after a certain time.

Decided to go anyway for some reason, but I will set a time limit. When I order the taxi, I will ask them about the latest time they can pick me up, but the latest I'd go for is half eleven. The party will be at half seven.

Why am I going? I'm not sure, don't even want to get drunk again, maybe because I pretty much slept all day and I need a good reason to get myself cleaned up and to keep things busy. People usually invite me to places, and usually I ignore them turning off the phone when I get phone calls, so for some reason I usually have the option to go out and sometimes I just, go really. Its like always having the option to go to a theme park, even though you usually wouldn't go, one day you may just do it for little to no reason or just for the hell of it.

Won't be there for long anyway. But the stress will give me the motivation to do other things I've been putting off like tidying up or whatever else there is to do.
