When I was younger, I used to wonder what grief would feel like. I thought I understood it, until it actually found me.

I lost my grandfather, and recently I lost my dog too. Since then, it feels like everything bad is happening at once. There’s no light anywhere I look. I’m stuck in a job that drains me, with no love or comfort to hold onto. I feel completely shattered, like I’ve forgotten what it feels like to be okay.

I try to get on with my day like normal, but out of nowhere a wave of grief hits me. When I try to distract myself, watching something, laughing for a moment, I feel guilty, like I shouldn’t be happy, like feeling okay means I’m doing something wrong.

I feel incredibly lonely, and I just needed somewhere to say that.
