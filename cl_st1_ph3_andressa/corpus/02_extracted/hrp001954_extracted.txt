(21f) I have literally no real life friends, only a few online ones and no family except my dad. I've felt quite lonely most of my life, have only had friend groups that lasted maybe a few months at most then was back to being lonely. I don't really have the energy to get real life friends. I really want most friends online, it doesn't matter if they are close or not  
  
 I thought I found someone who related, we became close due to both being lonely and he said he'd always prioritize me claiming i was his best friend but he started ditching me as soon as he reconnect with other friends.  


I guess i just always wished I had just one person who truly favored and prioritized me over anyone else, and I'd do the same to them. It feels like I always care way more about friends than they do about me. I like being supportive and trying to help friends through their problems (especially problems around other friends) but feel i need a person to be truly close to who truly likes and cares about me, won't ditch me as soon as something else comes up.  


I feel so sad and lonely and so badly wish to find someone who can kind of relate. even though I like to take days alone sometimes, i wish i had true friends. I have no idea how to get friends since I'm pretty shy and don't have many interests and tend to just play random nonsense on Roblox.   
  
I just really wanted to type this all out.
