I tried to seek validation from "normal people" don't wanna do that again

I tried to explain my life story, 27 male, virgin, no friends, no family, serverly physically ill to vent

and got downvoted to oblivion, invalidated my illness and my personality.

I mean tbh most of my responses were cringe, defensive, and weird..

But still it hurts.. because they don't understand what I'm going through. 

I feel like to them I look like a "creature" because I have 0 social skills.

Anyone wanna be friends? I like anime btw..
