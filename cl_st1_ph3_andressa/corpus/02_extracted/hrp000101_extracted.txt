A lil bit about me.

I'm 17 i have some Childhood traumas bcz of that I'm childish silly and a bit cringe bcz i wanna live the childhood again i lost bcz of the truama 

I don't have anyone to call friend in real life. 

I am not a cool person, i listen to music and watch reels on instgram that's all what I do.

People usually get bored of me and leave so please don't be like that and I get judged for my behaviour a lot too. 

If you are messaging me please tell me your proper introduction like age name gender.

I don't reply to just hey hello.

I'm very clingy and get attached too easily bcz I'm not loved in real life.

I accept a dm with a hope of finding a genuine friend :( . 

So please don't ghost. 

I hate people who just text for entertainment I'm not a source of your entertainment
