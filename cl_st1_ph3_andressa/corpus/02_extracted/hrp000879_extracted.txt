I'm 22 years old and I haven't achieved anything yet. I've wasted my time, my money, and my mental health. I can't concentrate on my college subjects because I'm so worried about debt. I was bullied throughout my childhood and adolescence, and today I suffer from social phobia and extremely low self-esteem, which makes me unable to even imagine myself in a relationship with a girl. I've attended several religions and read hundreds of self-help books, but with each passing day, I become more skeptical that a philosophy will give me a meaning in life or that God will perform a miracle and help me get out of this pit. To make matters worse, I was fired and am unemployed. I really hope I'm paying off some karma from another past life because not finding a reason for your suffering is the greatest pain of all.
