Basically the only people I have in my life are my two brothers who I never see. I got to see them during thanksgiving because my other brother is moving in with the other and I got a ride to help with the moving process. But naturally I won’t be able to. I don’t even have a car. It hurts knowing it’ll probably be another year. And I’m so alone. But I know it will happen. I’ll just go back to usual. Sleeping and no one talking to me.
