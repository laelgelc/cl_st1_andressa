For a long time, I’ve been carrying a heavy burden in silence. The pressure from loan sharks, the constant fear, and the feeling of being trapped have slowly taken a toll on my mental health. I wake up anxious, go through the day exhausted, and fall asleep with my mind still racing.

My parents died in 2018 and i don’t have anyone supporting me but myself, since they have a debt i am paying for it until now. This is me seeking for help cuz i can’t even afford my meal a day. I feel ashamed for being in this situation,Depression doesn’t always look loud—sometimes it’s just someone trying to survive each day while breaking inside.
