It's like even perverts avoid me out of fear. I've had this uncanny, weird vibe since I was young. I'm not even on men's rada; they see me as the weirdo creep to avoid. I step into a room and make everyone uncomfortable instantly. How am I not supposed to react when everyone looks at me with unease when I try to do something normal, like refill my water bottle? I've been instilled with this image as early as four years old by caretakers, I can't be anything except this. I don't like being the villain, but it's the only role I'm allowed to play.
