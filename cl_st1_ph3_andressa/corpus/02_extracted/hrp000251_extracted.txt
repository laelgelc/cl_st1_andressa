Sorry if this seems rude. I just feel safer around people my own age. I’ve been hurt a lot by adults when I was a kiddo :0 

I’m 19. I can chat with anyone who’s 18-25! I like JJBA, drawing, rock music, nature, animals, and bugs. Im online all the time. I don’t work or attend school, so usually I don’t have anything to do…
I’d join a server or gc but I’m too anxious for that. I feel like people dislike me because I can’t talk to people in groups.
