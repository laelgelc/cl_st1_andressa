I'm having a really hard time with some stuff in my life and I feel like I have no one to talk to about it. I'm trying to find people to talk to but it's like I'm meet with a wall EVERYTIME. Where or who can I talk to. at this point I'm tired of texting so a call would be great I guess. 

Oh and I'm female and 22
