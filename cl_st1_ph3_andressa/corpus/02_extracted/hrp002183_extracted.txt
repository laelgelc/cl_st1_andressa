So i was and am at both ends. I had huge cyrcle of friends now i am lonely as fuck? What change? My life... i just cant be SO positive and spontanious anymore. I am single mother now. I am tyred 99% of my life. I need acustome to my work, life, kid schedule to do anything. On top of that my health is shit now from all stress. So now i am not atractive to my friends to meet. All my friends are singles without children and carefree as buterflies. To me they look a bit childish now, to them i am too serious, negative, problematic. If i want people atencione i basicly need to fake my personality now to be more positive, more pleasant to be around, less boring... but i dont want to fake it anymore. The moment i started to be me: the tyred, pesimistic single mother people literally slowly left me and now i am alone. So so alone. I feel like i cant win, i feel bad if i am fake and acepted and i feel bad if i am myself but rejected. Also what not helps i live in rural town and basicly all social cycles are formed already and no activities to meet new people 😒 Sadly i have no family to lean on cuz they dont care about me, tgat always been that way.
