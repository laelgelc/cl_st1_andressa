Not talking to the introverts who don't want friends, and also not talking to the people who just want a romantic partner.   
  
Where are the people who don't have high school or college friends, but want to be social and like meeting new people? The ones who were too busy or moved too much or were dealing with personal things during their teens & 20s. Where do I go to meet you? Are you lurking in any online games you play with chat turned off, or is anyone like me actually out there, technically reachable if I just say hello?    
   
And if you don't actually go out and do anything, where would you want to go?
