I’ve actually never gone by myself, but today might be the first time I do. I’m starting to feel like people just genuinely don’t like me at college, and I’m probably gonna have to accept that until I glow up a bit. But for now I’m gonna have to be one of the ugly losers in the dining hall by themselves. Now people go to the dining hall alone all the time. But if you’re ugly and alone in the dining hall, you get stared at. I know it sounds wrong, but it definitely happens. And I’m definitely not one of the normal athletes or people doing work who would go by themselves. I’d probably look like one of the losers who doesn’t have friends because I’m physically unattractive. So yeah I don’t think I’m comfortable going to the dining hall by myself. I feel so fucking weird doing it to be honest.
