I'm currently working on a short film about a teenager living in an Indian sub-urban city, trying to deal with loneliness through recording video journals. In order to understand loneliness as a concept and feeling better, I need some movie and book recommendations. I want films and books which explore loneliness through a lens which isn't overly cynical, but raw, depressing (not too much though) yet hopeful. Would be even better if it's centered around teen/young adult characters or set in a sub-urban setting.  I recently read 'Letters to a young poet' by Rainer Maria Rilke and it talks about Solitude; how hurtful it can be and yet how important it is for a creator to experience it. I want more such recommendations of books which explore loneliness and solitude, especially in the modern age where people try to find connections online which are mostly fleeting and fragile. In the sub-urban areas where people might not even understand each other or live together harmoniously. tried reading A Catcher in The Rye though, but it just wasn't going well with the tone my film requires. I don't want books which are highly depressing or overly cynical, but which explore loneliness though melancholy, coupled with hopefulness and/or humor. Not saying it shouldn't be depressing at all, but not so much so that it comes across as intentionally bleak.

Movies of any language work, though I'd prefer if they're in English.
