I’m honestly so tired of being myself.
I’m exhausted from wishing I were different, daydreaming about a version of me I can’t reach. Everything makes me anxious and sad lately, and it all just wears me down. I’m stressed all the time. I’m tired of my own thoughts, my own skin I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore.
