I’m not sure exactly what I am trying to get out of this post other than some comfort for my loneliness. I am aching for somebody that I can’t have and I can’t stop the ache. It’s been proven to me that I can’t trust him… but this feeling won’t go away and it seems the longer the time passes it gets worse when I feel like it should be getting better.  It’s the most painful loss I have ever experienced and my brain keeps lighting up with a glimmer of hope that things will be how they used to be even though this is farthest from the truth.
