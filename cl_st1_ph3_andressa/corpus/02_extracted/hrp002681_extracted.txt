I'm so tired talking to people, putting an effort to chat them, but they are just ignoring my messages, I always think if they just don't like to talk to me or they just do it on purpose. So I decide to delete all my social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Messenger). I just want to be alone for some time and spend my time with my family. :(
