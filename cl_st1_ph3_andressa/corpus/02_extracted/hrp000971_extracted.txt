I feel so alone when I come to work and right when I leave it, it’s the only part of my day that keeps me from thinking negatively about the social state that I am in. At work I can turn myself off and fantasize about a life with more love in it, or read about things that make me think deeply about stuff no one else talks to me about.

Sometimes I try to search my name up again and again, like looking into a freezer with no food in it, hoping that I’ll find this crevice in the world where someone is thinking about me. What do they think I like? What’s the funniest joke that I’ve told? What am I thinking about?

I cry all the time about wishing I could have a big group of friends, or a relationship, change towns and just become something new. Pieces of me feel like goo now and I don’t know if it’s because I’m molding into something new or I’m just turning to mush.

I don’t think about god much, but I think I might a whole lot more. But even praying and worshipping someone else who doesn’t talk to me seems like a hard ask.

I want someone who wants to know me the way I’d love to know them.
