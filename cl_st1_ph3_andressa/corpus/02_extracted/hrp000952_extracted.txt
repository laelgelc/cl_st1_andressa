Hi everyone, this is my first ever post, and tbh I'm only writing and posting it bc I'm alone and drunk while my bf's at a party with his friends. I(f21) moved from my small hometown a little over a year ago to live with my boyfriend(m20) of now almost 2 years. I have trouble making friends, and I used to go to my bf's friends' parties but decided that it is better for my mental health to stay home while he goes, bc I'm ignored by everyone but my bf. I need help making friends. I need others to talk to other than my bf. If anyone wants to be friends or something pls comment or dm me or something. Thank you for listening or i guess reading lol
