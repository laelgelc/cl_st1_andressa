I dislike being alone, separated from everyone else, just trying to be myself. When I speak, no one listens. I'm not crazy, but it feels like I'm talking to myself and they just ignore me. It's not fair. I have to endure loneliness every day while other people my age are enjoying happy, fun lives. Meanwhile, I cry myself to sleep, knowing I'll be alone forever. It's my fate, and it's not changing anytime soon. I wish there was someone like me, but there isn't because I'm "special". Living in this body is a burden. I wish I were something better, but this is my reality and my fate forever, until I pass on.
