Video games are probably my #1. I love playing mario, smash, cod, fortnite, and others. It’s kinda a shame that I don’t have anyone to play with most of the time but it is what it isss

I looove music. Uzi and Carti are my faves (can’t pick between either one tbh) along with pierre bourne. He isn’t really as well known as the others but his music is perfect to just vibe to

I don’t really watch movies or tv shows but when I do, I usually love em. Into the spider verse, Brooklyn 99, and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina are some of my faves.

If you’ve got any similar interests, hmu! :)
