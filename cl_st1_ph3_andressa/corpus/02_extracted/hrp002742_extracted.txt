This seems like a thread for me, so i'm gonna share my story here.  I was in a bad relationship for 6 years. But i loved her very much and i hoped that things would work out but, as it usually happens, they didn't. I am single for the last several months. And somehow i adopted this lone wolf attitude, i usually am alone most of the time. In the last few months i have got several job offers, but i would have to move to a different country. And i kinda like the idea of moving to a different country and start over where nobody knows me. I have a very good friend in my town, and family. What are your thoughts about that?
