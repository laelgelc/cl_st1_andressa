I'm a 22-year-old man living in Cuba. I feel quite alone. I've tried to connect with the few people I have in my community and who make it easy for me through social media, but I've reached a dead end. However, I'm not looking for advice; seeking it now would assume there's a rational mind available to absorb it.

What I'm really looking for is to share. I feel that lately people are more hypervigilant and defensive than before, actively searching for hidden motives and rushing to judgment, which consequently conditions others to behave the same way. It's a cognitively demanding ecosystem from which I've felt the need to withdraw. Furthermore, I feel that we no longer see ourselves as individuals, but as collectives. If you belong to a community, you inherit collective labels that seem to negate your individuality. I feel that building bridges is becoming increasingly difficult.
