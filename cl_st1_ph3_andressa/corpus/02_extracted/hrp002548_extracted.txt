I’m just going to go ahead and get this out of the way, because I know everyone is immediately going to latch on to this fact, but I am a 21 year old man. “Oh you’re so young!” “You have plenty of time to figure it out!” “Just let it be, your time will come!” Please. I do not need to hear these same platitudes over and over again. I have had to watch literally everyone around me succeed in relationships. Hell, Ive had 3 friends from high-school get engaged just in the past 6 months. I, on the other hand, have not had any sort of meaningful connection with a woman since I was 17 years old. Now, I know my f’d up childhood has definitely not made things easier, but do I not deserve love? I tell myself all the time to be patient, but I am melting inside. All I’ve ever wanted was a family of my own, but sometimes I’m afraid it’s not in the cards for me. Is there anyone here that maybe had a similar feeling as I do, but eventually found something real?
