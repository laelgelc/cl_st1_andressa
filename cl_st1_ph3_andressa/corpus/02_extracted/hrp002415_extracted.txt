First time in 20 yrs of my life i went on a walk so long , about an hour. Usually i scroll , work , clean my house . 
Honestly loved this , I didn't wanna come back home .
Sad that community does allowed an attachments ( pics) . Actually i wanted to share the photos i clicked of some random beautiful flowers on streets.
