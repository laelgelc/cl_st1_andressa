I've been isolated physically, haven't really talked to anyone my age in real life so I resorted to making friends online. It didn't turn out to be any easier, but I've met people and I made friends, many of those who left.

Now I remain with a long term trio "S" & "A" ones whom I have known for the past few years and one "L" I've met a few months prior, I would do anything for them. I feel guilty when I say that I'm starting to care less about them.

How long can you go for before you start to realize that maybe you're not as important to them? I've been making friends online since 2019, not once has anyone remembered my birthday, not even my two best friends.

I know their favourite movies, songs, colours, activities, games, classes, I even know their schedules, but they couldn't name one thing about me. "L" complains about being lonely all the time, he whines about how one of his friends said she didn't want to hang out and immediately started talking to someone else in the server ignoring him, does he have to rub it in my face? They'd all rather hang out with others and talk to me for about 5 minutes to fill the empty spaces when they get bored.

I've brought it up several times, they don't take me seriously and change the topic.                       The thing is that I can't just block them and move on, these 3 are the only type of communication I get.

I have always been bad at making friends.                                                                                                             ***(I'm below 18 please don't DM me if you're looking to harass someone thank you)***
