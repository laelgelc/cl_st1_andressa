I’ve walked through rooms full of people, laughed at jokes I didn’t find funny, and nodded at conversations that weren’t mine.
I’ve felt invisible, even when someone looked directly at me. I’ve carried a storm inside me that no one noticed… until now.

Aloneness isn’t just about being by yourself. It’s about feeling like the world doesn’t quite fit you… and maybe, not wanting it to.
Some nights, I lie awake and talk to the silence, and strangely, it listens.
Some days, I feel like I’m made of pieces no one else could ever hold… but slowly, I’m learning to hold them myself.

To anyone scrolling, alone, feeling unseen… you are not broken. You are simply undiscovered.
And maybe, in the quiet, you’ll find a strange kind of freedom.
