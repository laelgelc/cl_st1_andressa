Is there a point where you stop caring? Is there a point where you’ll just be you with out having to think about it? I wanted to see what you guys think, I M 27 feel like there’s so much we all wanna share or say but sometimes concealing the whole truth. This last year I’ve been trying to get more out of my shell and talk to more people more often but sometimes I can’t fine the right words. There’s sometimes I’m content with the idea of just reading and watching around but I always come back to seeking out something in the end. Your thoughts? Your experiences?
