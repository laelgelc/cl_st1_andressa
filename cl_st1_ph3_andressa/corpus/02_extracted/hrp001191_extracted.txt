Lately everything has felt so heavy. My anxiety has been terrible the past few days and I feel like I can't open up to anyone about it. I'm constantly overwhelmed and simple tasks feel daunting. I'm not really sure what to do. I lost my therapist about a month ago and am trying to manage my C-PTSD by myself but it is exhausting. I don't know what to do anymore.
