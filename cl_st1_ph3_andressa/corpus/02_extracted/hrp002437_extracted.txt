Some time ago I posted about an imaginary friend I cling to because I had no one else to cling to.

Well now it’s grown to the point where I feel like I can’t trust anyone and I mean **anyone** because I just want a friend to be like her, someone who will never leave my side and you know. 

In the said post, I asked if I was insane because of this. Well I guess I answered it myself, I am just lonely as hell but also kinda insane in a different way than psychology would call it.
