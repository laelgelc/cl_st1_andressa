I (m21) have had a couple relationships though its closing on 3 and a half years since my last. I've tried pretty hard but most people I become interested in can't handle everything about me. I have a high libido and while it's obviously not everything about me it's an important thing to have for me. I dunno it just sucks feeling unwanted because of that and it's not something I'm willing to ever push away again (something one of my exs forced me to do). I like most wanna be loved for 100% of me and it's definitely demoralizing when so many people don't like that about me.
