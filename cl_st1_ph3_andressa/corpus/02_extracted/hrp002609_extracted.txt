I've been a loner after i passed school. Almost 10 years. Never felt lonely. Was mostly happy in my own company. Always alone but never lonely. Recently I went to have a meal in the mall food court. Many couples there. Something ticked inside me. Since then i have been feeling a bit lonely. Felt i should have someone. I was surprised by this as well. Maybe they added some drug in my food.

Does this happen to y'all as loners? I know i cannot hold a relationship going and i have no experience when it comes to relationship or people in general. Eight months since i started feeling this shit.

Too poor to afford therapy and too wise to consult google. So asking here.
