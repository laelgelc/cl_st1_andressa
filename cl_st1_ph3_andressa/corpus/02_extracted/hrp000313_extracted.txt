Those who see all the colors of this life deeply
are often the ones who walk alone.
Maybe solitude isn’t always emptiness.
Maybe it’s the cost of awareness.
When you start noticing the layers, 
people, intentions, moments, pain, beauty, you also start outgrowing noise.
Not everyone who walks alone is lost.
Some are just seeing more than others.
If you’re alone today, maybe you’re not behind.
Maybe you’re just ahead, quietly observing life as it really is.
It's my understanding.
