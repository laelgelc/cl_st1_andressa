I don't have anyone to say this, so just let me throw out everything. I'm so fucking tired of everything and this life sucks tbh. I want to say my emotions out but idk what I feel and what my emotions are really. I feel so sad and empty everyday, I don't feel like talking to anyone even my family and sibling and I feel like my soul is just dead and it's just there in my body. I don't have any friends other than my workplace. And I don't even trust them now cause they are just like other people right. I hangout with them but don't feel happy so I stopped that too. Even my dating life sucks, whoever I trust or love or whatever the f\*\*k I care about anyone, it's just worthless. I'm so done with life but idk what to do, so stuck that I don't even know my goals and my future. I have financial issues, overthinking issues, trust issues and just don't feel like I exist for myself anymore and I feel like this depression and anxiety will eat my brain someday. Tried everything to deal with this shit, good and bad things, even tried to believe god and worship him but end up awake all night making my mental health worse. I have tried therapy sessions like 4-5 times but it just doesn't help out. Idk what my emotions are and a therapist wants to know what makes feel sad. Like I JUST DON'T KNOW. Idk what to do anymore in my life.
