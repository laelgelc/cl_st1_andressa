I’ll be honest, I know I might be overreacting a bit but I genuinely think I will live out the rest of my days alone.

I’m still too young to say these things, I’m 20 and I have my life ahead of me, but my life has been stagnant for years and even though it will change soon it will definitively be for worse. I can’t seem to form new bonds, only break the few I have left. I’m still heavily dependent on my parents for transport because we have only one car for the four of us, public transport where I live is utter shit and I don’t have money to pay for uber constantly. I get too absorbed by college and I know that’s important but the way things are going I’ll have spent my early twenties wishing my time away instead of living it. I’m also heavily dependent economically on my parents and will be for a long time because my country’s economy is shit, so not even a six figure salary is enough for one person to live.

The worst part is that I’m too fucking square of a person to really do something about it other than whine to strangers on the internet. My mother is extremely over protective so even if by some fucking miracle I happen to meet somebody I like and likes me back, my life will be hell because there’s always some motive for her to make it unbearable to keep a relationship because “no one is good enough for me” or “they will hurt me” or “they will hold me back in life”.

I’m just tired of feeling so impotent, like my life is a car and I’m in the passenger seat. I know that even if I get help and change my attitude and my relationship with my mother that’s not going to change the money and transport issues. I’m scared one day I’ll wake up alone being 40 and wonder what happened with my youth, it is even scarier because I see no way out.

Sorry for all the swearing, I don’t like speaking like this but I’m just too frustrated with myself and my life
