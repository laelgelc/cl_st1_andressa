The first time I ever felt in love, it was someone I met when I was 12. Even now 20 years later, I think about him and how much influence that one year had on me. 

Love is one of the most fulfilling emotions in my life. When I look at the life that I’ve built for myself, I’m proud of how much I’ve pulled through. My life has everything I could possibly ask for, it’s damn near perfect. 

I was able to buy myself a house even though I just make a couple dollars above minimum wage, I’m still friends with people from childhood and all of them are genuinely good people, I have a stable career field that is in line with my values and needs. I have a lot of health problems, but I have the will to improve my health as much as I can. Also, if it wasn’t for my health problems, I would be in top shape with the amount of effort I put in.

The only thing I don’t have is a romantic partner. It makes me severely depressed. I feel like nothing helps. I’ve done intensive outpatient for depression. I will make time to do activities that I enjoy, prioritize spending time with friends. Practice DBT skills. 

Even after a lot of therapy sessions, my therapist kind of came down to the conclusion that it doesn’t appear that I’m imbalanced in some other area of my life causing me to be this sad about not having romantic partner. But my instinctual emotional need for romantic companionship is just really strong. I hate it. I want it to end. I want it to stop. I can’t stand it. 

I literally keep trying to lean into other things to make up for how much this hurts me, but it doesn’t work. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t know if anybody has some crazy ideas that I haven’t considered.
