We all know that there are 2 major problems here:  
1 - people that want to get romance out of friendship  
2 - people that keep ghosting everyone.  
Besides that, what are some things that make you want to dm someone in a post, reply to dms, and what causes you to ghost someone?  
I think that this is a great step to help everyone to get what they are looking for :)
