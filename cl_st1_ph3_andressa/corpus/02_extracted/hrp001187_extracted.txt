im a 20 year old girl who hasnt really experienced anything worthwhile. my experience isnt much similar to the usual trans experience as my transition started in adolescence and ive lived my teenage years and young adult as a female but even my cis girlfriends cant really help when i have dysphoria or raise trans related concerns. its a pretty lonely phenomenon. i have trans women tell me i should count my blessings just because im societally pretty but that doesnt matter because men still wanna just use me and not love me. i crave that pure love or just a allday friend but fails all the time. used to hurt but i kinda got used to the cycle of "guy hits me up thinks im pretty" "guy games with me and is nice" "guy finds out im trans and seems cool although shocked" "guy randomly blocks or ghosts" all i really wanted from them was a friend tbh yet still fail. its just a very lonely life to be trans. politics and a huge part of society sees u as a perverted freak of nature or mentally ill (which is funny granted i actually studied psychology) then men who have to be taught how to love u or dont try at all, and the tough time making friends as a human in America that im sure many of yall struggle with. in a perfect world im someones wife and mom and i dont have to deal with the anxiety of another post on social media about a trans topic being posted and having to see the awful comments. although transphobia thankfully doesn't really affect me personally in life it still affects me emotionally seeing it in society...
