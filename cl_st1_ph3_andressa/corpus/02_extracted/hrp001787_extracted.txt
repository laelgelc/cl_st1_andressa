I live with my mum because I have looked after her for years (limited mobility/all manner of health issues). I had to remind her that today was my birthday. The only person who sent me a text was my boss (she is a lovely lady but I'm not particularly close to her). The rest of my family just don't care. My friends unfortunately moved away years ago and we have drifted apart. I haven't celebrated my birthday for a long time and I thought I would be used to it but it just hurts. So badly.
