Today, marked my second decade on this planet and honestly, it wasn't that bad.I finally somehow mustered up the courage to push myself to eat at a restaurant alone, visited a local museum and ended the day with a small trek to a famous waterfall in my vicinity.Though the werid looks I got made me really awkward (It has become a famous Love Nest spot for some reason and I was the the only dude present 🥹).But the experience itself was quite soothing and the tranquil surroundings even calmed my anxiety and I forgot about the couples for a good while as I went on the trail.Even though I was missing companionship of any kind,It was better than my 19th birthday where I just doom scrolled and played video games all day and became extremely miserable. I am glad I went out by myself which made my day better even by a little margin.
