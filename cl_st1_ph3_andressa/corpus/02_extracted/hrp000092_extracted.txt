What have you been doing, plans etc. However trivial or small. Tell us what you will be up to over this weekend. 

Myself: today took the kids (twin boys 3 1/2) to local garden centre soft play. Picked up a few things to update the look and feel of my front garden. Tonight I’m going to be watching Vemon on Netflix with the wife. Tomorrow not sure what We are doing yet, mostly depends on the weather.
