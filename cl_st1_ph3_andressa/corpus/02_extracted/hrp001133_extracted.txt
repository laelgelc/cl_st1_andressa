Just wondering if anyone out there can relate. 

  
Just going through a tricky chapter in life right now. Have been living alone for about 3 1/2 years now. Struggling with the loneliness when I get home from work. Really want to get married but have never really dated. I have friends and hobbies but not people I see every day or things I do every day. I know what I want I just don't know how to get it. I want community and everyday love and support and trust. Things I had at other periods of life, but am now missing. 

  
Part of the problem is that I am really shy and do not click that well with most people I meet.
