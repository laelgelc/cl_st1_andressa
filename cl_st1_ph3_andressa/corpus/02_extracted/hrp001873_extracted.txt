I'm just so tired of walking into the same quiet room every day. Tried forcing myself out, but being around people just highlights how alone I feel. My head's starting to rot from the silence. I keep seeing ads for those AI chat friends... desperation's getting high enough that I'm actually considering it. Is that pathetic? I don't wanna depend on some fake person, but damn, I need something. Anyone else try this and not crumble completely?
