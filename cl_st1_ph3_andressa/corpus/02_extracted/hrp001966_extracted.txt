but, recently
Life has been pretty boring, Peaceful.. but boring.
pretty simple person, I am too.
Can't take Life seriously, So i act like a monkey
An, I like Primate's. they're Cool.

I never really had Romantic interest's.
But, I'm trying to give it a shot.
no one. yet.

My mind, has been wondering off an on.
Thinking about this giant Universe
We all live in
Pondering, about Life too.

Being alone, for 26' year's of my life
is starting have an effect on me
I been, bouncing in an out
of my mind, An Everything goe's to a void.

Literally no friend's.
never really thought of it, but..  I'm Lonely.

An, Now.
I'm getting addicted to that Solitude.
It's like a Drug, and i can't help myself to it.
