I’m no one’s favorite person. Not my friends. Not even my own family. And I’m not exaggerating.

If I don’t call, we won’t talk.

No one waits for me to text back. No one calls me excited to tell me something.

I just found out my mom takes my younger brother and sister on family vacations. I’ve never been invited. I’ve never even left the country. But apparently they’ve been on multiple cruises, to many different countries.

I don’t live with them so i know it’s normal to be left out of some things. But they have group chats without me. Do things without me. Travel, holidays, etc.

All my friends already have best friends. I know it’s normal for friends to have other friends and their own lives. So I try not to dwell on being left out when it comes to friends. But being left out from family really hurts.

It has really made me realize that I’m no one’s favorite person. I’m not anything to anyone. It’s so lonely. And I feel so pathetic. I’m always calling and asking to hang out or play games or talk. I’m always checking in. Everyone has their own lives and their own people. I thought these were my people.

It makes me want to distance myself. Stop reaching out. But then I’d be even more alone.

I think if something happened to me they wouldn’t even realize for a few weeks. It really sucks to come to this realization. I don’t even know how to fix this.
