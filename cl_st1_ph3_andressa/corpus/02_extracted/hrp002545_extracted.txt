Everywhere I go, I'm always an outsider, carefully listening to others around me interact with each other.

My mind goes blank trying to think of ways I can integrate and get accepted when I see people interacting with each other, and I'm the only one getting left out.

I can't escape being alone or sad. When I feel good one day, it inevitably doesn't last very long, and I'm stuck being perpetually sad and alone all over again.
