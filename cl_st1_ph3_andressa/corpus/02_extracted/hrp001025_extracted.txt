Just fyi, this is a throwaway account.

I want to preface this by saying that women's struggles (albeit different ones than men's) are just as valid. Feminism has been (and continues to be) incredibly important to grant equal rights and opportunities to women. Sadly we're not there yet everywhere in the world, but I hope that this will be the case eventually.

With that being said, the future for young, average men looks grim. Society hates them and refers to them as the source of all evil. They're outnumbering women by 5-10% depending on the location, so many of those men will end up being alone. Pair this with the fact that our libidos are asymmetric, men crave intimacy much more than women generally speaking. The majority of the women I know are totally content with being single their entire lives - but almost no man I know thinks the same. The economy is crap, so the already little money you have is worth nothing, meaning you can't even cope with hobbies you enjoy (pretty much every hobby costs money except for some sports).

  
I'm 28 years old and at the lowest point of my life. I've been in shared interest groups and on dating apps for a decade but nobody wanted to go on a date with me. I haven't even had so much as a kiss, let alone a girlfriend or sex. The only thing that keeps me alive right now is rotting in the gym. Over time I've realized that many young men are just not meant to have a good life. We're supposed to work our asses off for society, shut up, and ultimately die alone.
