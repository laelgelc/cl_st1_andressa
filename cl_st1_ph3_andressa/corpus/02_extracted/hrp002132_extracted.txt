It might be difficult what you're going through and it feels like the days are long and the struggle never ends. You became distant from everyone and stopped sharing your problems when you felt nobody really cared. Like you're completely alone even in the company of people. I made this post hoping the right audience will read it. The same way you distrust what others say and label their crazy ideas as conspiracies, you should distrust what you think about yourself (you are NOT a failure). Putting all your effort in life to get things done and realize that hard work is hardly rewarded in this world doesn't mean you should drop out, you just have to change priorities. I personally gave all my affection and purest intentions to the wrong person and that made me realize you can't put your hopes on other people, but you can always hope to improve yourself and your ecosystem. Don't take it personal against yourself when most people are fake and would sell you out for cheap. Nobody in this world defines who you are, you do that yourself. Regardless of your age, race, and gender. You Will see light at the end of the tunnel when you start living on your own terms and that life is never gonna be easy but you are going to be prepared when the difficult times come.

You are amazing, you're strong, and you are more than whatever battle you're facing right now
