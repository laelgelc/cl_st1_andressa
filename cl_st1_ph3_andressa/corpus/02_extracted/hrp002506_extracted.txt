Hii Again.. Something happened that got me thinking. I am naturally an introvert person and I deal almost everyday with not being included in stuff and planning. I have made my peace with it honestly but sometimes I cant help but feel bad. There was this thing in the office yesterday and everybody decided to wear white. They didn't tell me or forgot to tell me I dont know. I was the only one not wearing the theme. I felt really bad and hurt. Everytime I make my peace with things. This is just something I couldn't get out of my head. What should I do?
