Last friday was my work's dinner party.
I've been working there for almost 19months now, and some months back I asked a coworker (F) out a couple of times, never accepted. Some weeks ago she asked ME to the cinema, i asked her if she wanted to pick her up, and so i did, we chatted on the way there, then at the movies she satm leaned to the other side i was sitting, like the whole time. Then made a comment about the food court that after getting her home i said "mh, maybe she wanted to eat out" but well, it was a really passing comment. 

Well, then last night at the party, I went a couple of times to talk to her and such, but everytime she would "sneak" away, to talk to some (girl) friend or what ever. It makes me feel like idk, but the demeanor at the party was really great tho, like she told her friends and cousin i was her favoirte at work and such (everyone was drunk)


just throwing shit out
