I’ve always seen myself as someone who values alone time more than normal people. Since coming to college I’ve now truly noticed that I don’t enjoy talking and interacting with others. But I’m confused if I’m just bad with people or actually just like to be alone. It’s always been hard for me to partake in small talk and just act normal with people. Every morning I wake up and wonder what I’m even doing in this world, why was I put here? I try to answer this and tell myself this is how the universe made me and I should be happy to here. But I’m not happy. Everyone that walks past seems to give me looks as I must come off as unapproachable, but I actually see myself as a caring and helpful person. I don’t want to make it seem like I’m complimenting myself but I enjoy giving to people or helping them, if someone needs something I will always try to assist. If people would give me a chance and try to understand me I feel like we could relate. I’ve always viewed others as the “bad guys” but now I’ve realized I don’t give people the opportunity to get to know me because all my previous experiences has brought me nothing but emptiness. I want to live a normal guys life I think, but I guess it’s just not for me.  On top of it I have intense rosacea on my face and it’s seems to give off the image of me being a monster or alien to others. People will be walking with friends then stop talking when they pass to then just break out in laughter preceding to call me “red face” or “rosey” I witness that everyday, I try not to let it get to me but I can’t help it. I feel that it is a big reason why I’ve kind of just given up on people and trying to form relationships. No one cares what I feel on the inside they just see just see me at surface and that surface is to stay away from him. Thanks for reading this if you’d did.
