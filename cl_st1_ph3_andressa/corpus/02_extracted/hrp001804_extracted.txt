I left Reddit 5 months ago because I was keen to embark on a self improvement journey and, well, you know how bad social media is for your mental health.

I’ve had support workers who check in on me a couple of a week for the past couple of years and one of them has been my rock. She helped me with so much stuff and drove me to be a better person with her unique style of kind, honest and helpful support. 

I’ve made so much progress with her behind me and after 3 years at the job and having supported loads of different people she has changed jobs and will no longer be my support worker. We have, instead, become good friends which is something I have desperately needed over the past few years.

I know this is r/lonely and saying “I have 2 close friends” is dangerously close to bragging but I’ve been incredibly emotional since her last day and also had a really bad cold so I’ve had no choice but to recover and rest up. I know that I’ll eventually better and back to hanging out with my friends but right now the loneliness is completely taking over. 

I’m drained from the cold and the emotions around not being able to see one of my friends for a month and it’s driven me back here to Reddit where I always used to come when I was lonely a year or so ago. It’s probably about a week until I’m back to normal but I wanted to get something out as a cathartic release.
