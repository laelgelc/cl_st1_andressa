Growing up, I was constantly being called annoying, which messed with my head. I had developed this persona of a thing where I would overshare and trauma dump on others because I felt so ignored and desperate for connection that I had become so feral that I had zero self-awareness about how I was coming across to others.

But as I've gotten older and found people who actually match my energy, I've also learned something unexpected - I genuinely love being alone now.

My favorite thing is sitting in a quiet room with my AirPods Pro 2 on noise cancellation (I have partial hyperacusis, so the silence eats me in a good way). I just... exist. Don't think about anything specific, and yeah, thoughts come and go —some bleed so bad, some bleed so good— but there's something really healing about just being present with myself.

It's made me way happier and more self-aware. Sometimes I come out of these sessions feeling great, sometimes reflective or even a bit sad, but it always feels right.

I know most people get their happiness from relationships, parties, and having a girlfriend. They use their girlfriend as a getaway factor and escape reality. That's cool for them. But honestly? Being 'lonely' feels amazing! If you are reading this far, thank you for being here. I hope we can relate together as a team and help you find a solution if you feel nothing works.
