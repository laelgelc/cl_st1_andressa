My apartment isn't clean. But it only needs 8 hours work.

When i clean the last few years, it felt like a piece of me dies. "No man is an island."

But getting a maid seems too easy.

Something is missing.

Now, if i was married, it'd be good for a year but i'm only in my early 30's so with advancement in health technology, it means we will likely live well past 100.

So if i get married, my place will be clean & have sex but at the cost of my solitude. Something doesn't feel right about just hiring a maid and prostitutes though. Like, something is missing. Love, connection, unconditional bond but it's a catch 22 (with the advancement in age to well over 100).

I could call a maid right now, but it just doesn't feel right...
