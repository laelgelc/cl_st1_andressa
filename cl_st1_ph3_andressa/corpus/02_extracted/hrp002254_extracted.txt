I don’t know why I’m typing this it doesn’t matter but every time I spend time with people it feels like my mind is in the back of my body and I’m almost out of it. It feels like my body has disconnected with my perception, like my body is on autopilot and I let my mind run free. It’s weird and i don’t know why but my body feels like a vessel. It hasn’t always been like this, this started recently about 9 months ago and it feels like life is a never ending cycle of moments then boredom, it feels like everything is set in place and I’m just going through it, but when I try to talk to people they don’t listen, I’m either ignored, interrupted, or not listened too. So why even bother with talking, and when people talk to me it sounds like there’s a good answer and a bad answer, it’s just up to me to figure it out. I’m tired but restless, exhausted at the fact I’m going to live the rest of my life like this, self conscious, aware, overthinking, deep thinking, I hate it it sucks it makes me feel “not human” like everything is a play, human interactions just feel like an improv play and everyone’s an actor for an invisible audience, and I’m a “bad actor” by being awkward and not being “normal” when I try so hard to be, I feel like I’m going insane, like if one more traumatic thing happens, I’m going to lose it and be completely isolated and distant from life itself. I don’t type this for pity, nor for empathy I just want to be heard and feel some sort of interaction with others
