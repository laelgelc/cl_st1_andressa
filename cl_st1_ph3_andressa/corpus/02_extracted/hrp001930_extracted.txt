I’m just so stressed atp. My social situation is just horrible rn and it’s really pissing me off. My roommate is nice, but sometimes she’s angry and then lets it all out on me, so it can be really hard whenever she’s in that mood. The girls in my class are also nice, but very immature and chaotic sometimes where my head feels like exploding (they fight and scream like little kids despite being in high school). So we just have two other girls left in my class, one is an exchange student so she’ll go soon and the other one is well really interesting. She can be nice, but also very mean/ inappropriate. My school is extremely small and the girls from the upper classes are either chaotic/immature or shallow/mean. There’s no in between. Don’t even get me started with the boys though. They’re the most arrogant,snobby,mean and disgusting people you’ll ever meet. It’s always a push and pull between these two groups of girls and I don’t feel like I belong anywhere, so I just go along with whatever group. To make matters even worse it’s a boarding school.
