Id been in a relationship for five years, he was my best friend and I'd talk to him everyday, well he dumped me and while we still talk it's clearly not the same and it kinda,,, hurts to see how many people he can talk to and how he's replaced me, while I have nothing. I just,,, don't make friends that way, I have a very niche hobby I need people to meet me on for me to feel any connection on. Real life especially I can't deal with people, I don't like people,I don't like socializing and I find people taxing. It just kinda sucks.
