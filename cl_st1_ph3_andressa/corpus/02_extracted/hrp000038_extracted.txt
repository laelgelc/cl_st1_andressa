Ok so I recently came out to my friend as bi and she started yelling at me and calling me a f*ggot and I don’t know what to do because I can’t tell my parents because they’re homophobic and I don’t wanna tell any of my friends because I don’t really have any really close friends so I came here. If anyone else has had an experience like this could you please give me some advice because I don’t know what to do or where to go and I’m having a mental breakdown and I just need some advice or something because I really don’t know what to dooooo
