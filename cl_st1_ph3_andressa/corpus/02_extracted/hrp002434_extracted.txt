Let's say you have a neighbour who you really like. He's a nice person, you like to speak with him when you see him; you enjoy his company when you meet him at a party; you are glad when he is present at a local community gathering, because he always has something clever or funny to say. And yet, you wouldn't like to be in a relationship with him, you wouldn't like to live in one flat with him, you wouldn't like to travel somewhere with him, you don't invite him for your birthday. You just don't want him to be a part of your life.

Does anyone else here feel similarly? Because I do. Everyone likes me... but no one really wants me in their life.
