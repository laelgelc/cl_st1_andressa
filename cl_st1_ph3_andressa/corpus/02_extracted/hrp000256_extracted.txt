I'm not bitter or suicidal, more like worn out and just going through the motions of life.     I wouldn't dream of saying life's been hard for me...not when I have met so many people whose lives were so much worse than mine has ever been.  

More like...life's always been lack luster for me. Born with a defective brain (learning disabilities) which lead to be struggling all my life to do anything on a level considered to be "normal", shamed and abused for it, shunned and sometimes dehumanized I took some bad advice when I was younger and now at 40 all I can say for myself is, "I made my bed, now its time to sleep in it".  

I didn't start out as a loner, but I became one lock stock and barrel when I was 11, that was when I finally realized how much my peers hated me, no...they loathed me for not being like them.   Well I took the hint and from then until I was 26 I was practically a mute, speaking only when spoken too, leaving people alone, staying way from girls/women *(which I knew without needing to be told was what they wanted).*  

Even after I joined the Army I have found that the less I talk, and the less I am seen the better people like me.  I don't try to make people dislike me, I never have, I just naturally bore/repel people and so I do my best to not inflict myself on others.
