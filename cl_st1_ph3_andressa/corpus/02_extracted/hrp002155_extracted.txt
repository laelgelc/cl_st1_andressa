As usual I'm screaming into the void. 

No matter how many people I'm around I still feel totally alone. Well .... except for the voices in my head. 😂 

When I listen to the song  Mr Lonely...I swear that song was written with me in mind. 

I'm so tired of faking it that I'm happy when I'm really broken inside .

Am I really alone in feeling like this ?
