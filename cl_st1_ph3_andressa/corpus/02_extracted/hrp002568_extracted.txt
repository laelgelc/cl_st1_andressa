I thought I was perfectly fine with being unseen and ignored but today it bit me where it hurts.

I went to my Church's Christmas service ; Everyone in there was with their family / partner / friend and were having a great time. None of the usual people I meet and chat-with on Sunday service seemed to even notice that I was even there , later a couple of them chatted for a minute. it just seemed like pity, I sat through it and was the first one out of the door.

The Choir was great though.
