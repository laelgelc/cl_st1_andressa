See title. I will take any suggestions. 

Covid lockdown did not end for me. I act in total isolation much of the time as I have to use a text to voice app to ask for anything. If it takes 5 seconds to type a statement and 7 seconds to play it, the most I have spoken to people is asking for behind the counter drugs at the chemist. 

I am autistic. Generally taking to people is putting my hand in a bag of spiders, but if something happens while I am home, it could be months before anyone notices. It is probably, for my own safety, that I make some kind of contact but I do not know where to begin.

All advice will be taken seriously if offered.
