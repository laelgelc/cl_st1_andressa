Nah and I want to travel. Ha!

I booked a salon appointment hoping to fix the back section of my hair and maybe have a small chat with the hair stylist. ( you know the regular customer experience) but nah of course not. Since I’m hella ugly and everyone hate me on first sight. Of course I’m met with disappointment and disrespected. Welp at least she was honest with me that she’s not up for the task. I think she could easily cut it but since I look ugly, they thought meh she isn’t worth any effort. Theses assholes are all the same rude, mean, sneaky and they act like I asked them to perform an open heart surgery. 😒

This is why I avoided going to the salon all these years. People are insanely hatful towards me.
