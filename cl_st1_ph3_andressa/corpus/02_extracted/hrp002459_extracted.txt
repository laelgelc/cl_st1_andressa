Feel like summer somehow sheds a spotlight on the fact that I am a reject, noone chose. No one chose to take me for a national celebrations, street parties, swims, cycling or kayaking trips, beach days, music festivals, trips lor just hanging out doing summer things. 

It is the season of having hope and getting your plans rejected only so that they can hang out with someone else. It is the season of being ghosted. It is the season of waiting for a yes. Just to see them big someone shiny.

It is the season for pronounced loneliness. I have started to hate summer.
