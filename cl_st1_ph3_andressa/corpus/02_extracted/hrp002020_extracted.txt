For a couple news, I’ve been so desperate to change my physical appearance in order to make more friends. While I’ve lost a substantial amount of weight, altered my fashion sense, maintained my hair better, and overall improved my grooming, this has had little to no affect on my social wellbeing. My looks might reel people in, but the never stay. Why? Because my personality annoys the living hell out of everyone.

I have ADHD and Autism too, so that doesn’t help me either, but even when I try and mask it, my true self always pops out and it repels everyone around me. I talk way too much, I’m too passionate about niche interests, i talk about topics nobody else knows/cares about, I say things out of impulse and don’t realise I’ve upset/angered someone, I make a fool out of myself, I have people laugh at me rather than with me.  The key adjectives always throw at me are ‘annoying’ ‘draining’ ‘too much’ and ‘weird’

It’s a constant vicious cycle I’m stuck in where nobody wants to stay in my life, and honestly, it’s not surprising. I just wish I was neurotypical sometimes.
