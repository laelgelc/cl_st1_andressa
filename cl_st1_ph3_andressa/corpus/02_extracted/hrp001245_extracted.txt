This hits so hard…
“Chosen Ones don't isolate because they're antisocial, they isolate because they're overstimulated by mediocrity. When you're consistently the smartest person in the room, you get tired of shrinking your vocabulary, watering down your insight, and pretending not to see the patterns everyone else keeps tripping over. High frequency minds don't enjoy playing dumb just to keep low frequency egos comfortable. That's not arrogance AT ALL, that's self preservation. Authentic people don't lack friends because they're flawed. They lack friends because truth has a high entry fee, and most people would rather bond over distraction than elevation. A lighthouse doesn't chase ships. It stands alone and the ones meant to find it do.”

Thoughts?!
N where are those meant to find and resonate with me??
