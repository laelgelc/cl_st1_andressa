I've had many suicidal thoughts. I'm not in any danger but I know in my gut whether in a month or a year or a decade the way I die will be via suicide. I feel dumb. I have no creativity, my mind is jumbled. I'm stupid and I hate myself. I feel abnormal. I have so many hopes and dreams and yet I know I'll never do them
