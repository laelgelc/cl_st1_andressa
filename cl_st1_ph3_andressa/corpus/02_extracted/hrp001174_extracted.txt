being lonely is a tricky thing. we often think that it's bad to be alone. and that just because we're alone it means that we can't fight our battles. but I want to bring some light.

all pain is temporary. one thing I learned about being a historical fencer and being hit by a hard metal stick over and over and over again in the arms, shoulders, ribs, hands, and neck, is that all pain is temporary. sure It might Sting to be hit in the right spot where your fencing gear is at its weakest, and that no matter how many bruises you get or how sore you are the next day there's always a Way Forward.

and that through all of your weaknesses and flaws, that it's okay to be in pain. that it's okay to accept that you will become stronger. that sometimes sitting by yourself and nursing your wounds and putting ice on a large bruise is all a part of the process.

it's all about understanding that through it all you can topple it. dealing with the grief, the regret, the sadness, and the insecurity is that you are still capable of passing through the fold. that sometimes that journey is a lonely one. it's realizing that there is never a way out but there is a way through it.

to take on the pain of a dull sword blow, a heartbreak after your girl leaves you for another, a failure to program enemy AI in a solo game dev project, or when one of your loved ones becomes a deadly victim of the ever growing statistic of cancer patients, that through all the tears, blood, and anguish, that if one chooses to continue fighting the good fight they will discover who they are.

stay safe friends. you can be valuable. your life is worth living. you have a gift and it shouldn't be wasted. life is a blessing in disguise as a curse, and you should never give up and keep fighting. deuces.
