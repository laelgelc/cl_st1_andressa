For the first time in my work life I feel like the outsider and loser. I had 3 jobs in total the first two I loved my coworkers and we had lots of fun in and outside of work. Now since February I started a new job with 4 other guys at the same time. We have to go to classes to learn everything about the job and these classes are all year long.At the beginning we hung out alot during work and classes, but I started to distance myself a bit because I realized that theres guys are nothing like me, they are very childish, have in my opinion a very sexist mindset(cheat on their gf’s and their insta is full of thirst traps of girls) and they talk bad about everyone in class and then proceed to talk to them normal just to get notes. On top of that they think they are the shit and it gives me high school vibes and everything. Now that I distanced abit from them they think I betrayed them or something idk, but we had a group chat but now they have their own(I saw it) and they don’t share notes anymore with me and I once asked for a folder from another guy in the company and he said the 4 guys had it and then I asked the guys and they said the don’t know where it is…

It’s the first time something like this happened to me tbh. I love my life outside of work and have great friends with good mindsets but when I think of work it starts to give me the ick. I just want the classes to be done with.

You could say “your fault, you just had to fake it through until classes are over” but that’s no like me, if I don’t f with you I don’t fake being friends with you.

What do you guys think? What helps and am I overreacting?
