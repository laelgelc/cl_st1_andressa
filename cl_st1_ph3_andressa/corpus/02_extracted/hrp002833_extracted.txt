* Website: Josephe started working on a website. Simple but functional. The more we talk around us, the more it's important to have it.
* New person: Steve joined us. 
* Brainstorming: We talked about content and format of the hackathon and how to get people involved. The number of people who want to help is growing, but the concept around all of it is still very vage. We could try to connect to groups on Meetup.com who have a local presence. Spreading the word through these? Thus maybe organise a meetup that is not fully online only, but with local "branches" that meet face to face? And should this hackathon be part of something bigger? But how to build something bigger without a central organisation?  
* Mission statement: Linked to the above, we thought that it might be useful to work on something like a "mission statement", some guiding principles (more than what is currently in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/wiki/index) that could be used as a general framework to guide our discussions. 
* Purpose: Based on some discussions on Reddit, it seems that lack of "Purpose" is something lonely people often lack. We could focus more on that for our own team, but also for those whom we want to involve as participants. "Purpose" has a more positive connotation than "loneliness"...
* Connecting to "experts": We could try to contact people who have a deep knowledge in that field and who could help spread the word, e.g. authors of famous books. 

To do: 

* Josephe continues working on the website.
* okko7 explores the idea of a mission statement
* Steve: Puts together a list of literature / references that could be integrated in our website.

**Next hangout:** Next Saturday, May 5th at the same time (10am CST, 11am EDT, 17:00 BST and 18:00 CEST) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4aT3pc).
