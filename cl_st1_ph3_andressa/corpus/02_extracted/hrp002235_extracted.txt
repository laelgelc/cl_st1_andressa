Hey folks. I’m in my mid-40s on the Jersey coast and looking to meet a few new people to chat with semi-regularly. Nothing weird, just conversation and some new human beings in the rotation.

A few things I’m into:

• Cocktail creation and spirits — I develop my own syrups, shrubs, and cocktail recipes.

• Music — punk rock, roots reggae, rock and roll, outlaw country.

• Playing guitar — been at it for years.

• Cooking and food — sushi, Mexican, Indian, gastropub stuff.

• The beach, being outdoors, and good conversation.

If you want a laid-back, sarcastic, decent human to chat with about life, music, drinks, or whatever’s on your mind, feel free to say hi. I don’t mind age differences — just be an adult and be respectful.
