I had a lot of friends until I had a nasty breakup from one of my abusers. Lost all my friends. 

A couple of years later I was in a new state and I also had a lot of friends, but I was abusing drugs and that ended catastrophically. Lost all my friends (clean now thankfully).

Then a couple years after that I had another nasty breakup. Lost all my friends again. 

Maybe I deserve this. Maybe I'm just a bad person who doesn't deserve a relationship or any friends. 

Right now I'm in a new town and I am part of a community but I have no close friends. There is somebody I'm getting closer to and she has expressed that I make her feel really comfortable but I'm holding back hardcore. I'm afraid to let her in. I should wait until I'm a better person. 

I also deleted Facebook because it was stressing me out but I kept a few friends' phone numbers, but I rarely reach out to them. 

Maybe I'm just not meant to have friends. Maybe I should be alone. Maybe it's better off that way. I'm starting to like being alone. This way I can never hurt anybody. It's what I deserve.
