Even though I'm in a relationship and want to think she cares about me. I still feel alone. I don't know if it's me getting into my own head again or what but I just think that nobody really cares.

Sometimes I wonder if anyone I know would feel different without me around. I'm not suicidal but I just feel like I'm just a waste. I did what I thought I had to do in life. Finished high school, got 2 college degrees, worked and for a time I had my own place.

I just don't know where I went wrong and I keep thinking that maybe I'm just cursed to fail at anything I want to succeed in. Be it relationships, jobs, friendships, even being a family member people want to be around.

But somehow I just fail at it all and the only thing I can feel is either sadness or anger. From time to time I do feel happy. But its so far and in between I actually forget what it feels like.

Its things like this that make me wonder if I should even try cause somehow it'll just blow up in my face like the rest. My biggest dream is to have a family of my own but I just think that's all it'll ever be. 

Kinda funny to think it may just be God getting back at me for existing.
