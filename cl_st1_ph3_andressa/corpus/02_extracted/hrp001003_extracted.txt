I only make friends with online strangers easily but irl?
It just doesn't seem like anyone wants to be my friend.

I would hang out with my husband's friends. I used to believe they were also my friends but lately, it just feels like I'm not wanted or I don't belong. I have to ask to join in on their hang outs days despite them inviting everyone in the group but me.
When it comes to gaming, they call for everyone to join but me.
I just feel like they don't want me around at all.
My husband doesn't really do anything to acknowledge the issue.

I just feel like if I go missing, no one would even care.
