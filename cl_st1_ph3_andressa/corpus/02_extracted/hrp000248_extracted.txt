I honestly think that I'm alone because I enjoy my own company best. I also find that I am not very comfortable in the company of other people. Even more, I find that the people who seem to adopt me as a friend are not people that I enjoy being with. I don't really know what kind of person I would want to have as a friend and when it comes to partners, there doesn't seem to be the kind of woman I want in the world. In short, I've made my bed. It's a single.

Any woman who is interested in finding out if she matches up with my ideal can DM me. I have it all written out.
