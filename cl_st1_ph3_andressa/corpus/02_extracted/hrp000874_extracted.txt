If somehow, I always feel like I'm not a priority for anyone, and that somehow I can never be myself with someone, sometimes I miss talking to someone the way I used to talk to some people I loved.
But it never comes back, I can't connect with anyone else, sometimes I catch myself thinking about dying soon
