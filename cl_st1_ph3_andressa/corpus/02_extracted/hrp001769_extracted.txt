I just let the tears come, scrolling on TikTok. I'm not crying over loneliness. I don't do that anymore because I'm so used to this. 

I spent my high school years without friends so this isn't so difficult anymore. Sometimes I just stop to think about what I'm missing out on. What would it be like to have someone to sit next to during lectures? Or have lunch with a friend group? Have some fun event to look forward to? I have a hard time comprehending that some people actually have social life. that it isn't necessarily normal to go weeks without seeing anyone. 

When I was in high school I would cry about my loneliness almost daily. Now thinking about it doesn't make me emotional. I cannot imagine my life any other way.
