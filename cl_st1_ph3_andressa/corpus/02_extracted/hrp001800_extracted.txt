I'm lonely NGL. Been doing little things to distract myself. Anyone else feel the same way? Not so lonely that I want to die however I am trying to stay busy even if it's something dumb so I don't have that feeling. DistractDistractDistract. Is my weekend goal. Getting a little closer to better days I hope. What is everyone watching tonight or doing for Friday night  I'm about to throw a new  show on streaming and see if I get hooked or not.
