Nobody has feared, braved, or befriended
loneliness quite like I.
In the race to outrun loneliness, I stumbled upon moments it became my strength, my sanctuary, my home, my mate.
And now, I feel not afraid of its unwavering fate

To those who say, "Darling, you can't live alone forever,"
I ask, "How long is forever?
Is all my life long enough?"
If so, I have been alone forever already—
And I can do it forevermore, hmpf
