My wife of almost 20 years and I now live apart. I don’t know if I want to be with her again, but I’m so damned lonely every day. I have two dogs and they’re my only interaction. I don’t leave the house except for groceries. I don’t talk to anyone. I feel as though every day is a chore and the exact same thing. I just turned 60 and am craving to talk with someone in a similar situation.
