I’m 28 and I literally have no friends.
People are friendly to me. They joke, they’re nice, they love me - my coworkers, neighbors etc.
But it never goes past surface level.
No one actually wants to know me deeper.
No one stays, or if they do- they keep talking about themselves and act like I'm the only one who needs a friendship.
No one tries to build a real friendship.
I know I’m not the only lonely person, so many of us are.
That’s what confuses me the most.
If so many people feel lonely, why does it seem like no one wants to be vulnerable, intentional, or put real effort into friendship?
Why does everything stop at “friendly” and never become real? This pisses me off so badly, like literally so badly
