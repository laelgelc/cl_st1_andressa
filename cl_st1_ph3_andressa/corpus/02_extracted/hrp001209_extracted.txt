The amount of times I’ve heard this saying and yet nothings changed honestly pmo. I don’t think it’ll ever get better bc I haven’t seen any changes yet. 

“You’ll find someone one day” “I’m pretty sure someone is out there for u” alll the same bs that I hear from ppl who have everything going on in their life. And it’s like…why are u lying to me? I get your trying to be positive and keep me in good spirits but I genuinely don’t believe it anymore. I’ve been lonely and miserable ever since I was 15 and iys still going on til this day. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. When will it ACTUALLY get better for me? I just want to have a good life with someone ya know. And yet I have to suffer in my own spiral of loneliness everyday.
