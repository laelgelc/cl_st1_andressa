I’m 23 and I feel like I’m living as a dead person. I work in retail and people treat me like I don’t matter. Customers are rude, my family doesn’t really get it, and my sister… we used to be close but now it feels like I lost my best friend. Most of my friends are online, my other family lives far away, and no one really reaches out — I feel invisible most of the time.

I miss when I mattered to my parents. My dad struggled with addiction and died from an overdose. I have complicated feelings about him — I miss who he was when I was a kid and he was just my dad, but I’m also hurt and angry about how things ended. I wish I could talk to him one last time, hear him say “I love you,” and get a hug.

I’m also 23 and I’ve never had a girlfriend. I like being alone, I really do, but it would be nice to have someone to share life with. No one really notices me like that in public, and it sometimes feels like it could never happen for me.

I’m not suicidal, I just… want to be seen. I want someone to notice me, care about me, and just be there. I want people who understand what it’s like to be lonely, overlooked, and grieving all at once. I just want to feel like I matter.
