So I'm trying to not let this ruin my weekend. Thursday at work (I'm an elementary school janitor) someone texted my boss that I was sitting asleep.... I wasn't.... My head was pounding and I was trying to function.... I didn't call out cause we're already down 2 people from the crew.... My boss texted "we'll discuss this matter Monday".... But I know he doesn't believe me.... Also I'm sad that someone would immediately text him and try and get me in trouble and not think that something was wrong cause I'm a good reliable employee yet they couldn't even check on me before trying to be a rat....So Friday I wake up and I'm immediately getting sick (exactly what you think I just don't want to type it) and when I go to take my lil step dude to school I had to open the door and barf all over the parking lot.... Obviously I can't clean a school like that.... I call and text my boss with no response so I follow protocol and call my principal.... She was extremely nice and understanding and didn't want me to come to work like that.... But now at 1am Saturday morning I'm second guessing my decision to stay home.... Either way they'd have been mad.... If I spent the whole shift in the bathroom at work or at home either way I'm not getting work done... But I feel like I've set myself up for an even bigger ass chewing come Monday.... I'm hoping I don't let this ruin my weekend
