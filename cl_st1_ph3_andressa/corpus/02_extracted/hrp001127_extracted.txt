I'm a pretty cool guy, atleast thats what i think. I cannot exactly say that i dont have friends and all, i get along with people just fine and I've noticed a lot of people feel attracted towards me, like you know they want to talk to me and all. 

But the thing is, all of the people i know, my "friends", "family" whatever, everyone seems to maintain a certain boundary line with me. It feels less like having people of my own, and more like people watching me afar. I dont know how to express this feeeling, but i feel like people are just standing it a round circle and im doing tricks in the middle for their entertainment. For example, nobody wished me on my 19th birthday. That was a big blow to my face bacause it made me realise how less important to these "friends" i am. I've started to think that i was nothing more that some crowd. As ikept growing up, i kept seeing people go further and further from me. It's like, they wont leave, but stand at a distance and cheer for me.

Honestly all I've wanted in this life is a brother. A friend. who would come chill on my room like he owns it. Whom I wouldn't have to maintain distance from or worry about "what he will think" because i know he wont judge me. I can run to at 3 am at midnight if i need to. But i dont know, nobody seems to step up for that role.

So yeah, here i am, with a hell bunch of "friends" around me and i still feel alone. I dont know what went wrong. I dont know if I'm overthinking. And sorry if this post is too long, tbh im just venting here cus apperently, i dont have anyone to vent to.
