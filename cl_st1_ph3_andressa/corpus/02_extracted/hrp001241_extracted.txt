After my last heart break from an almost 3 year relationship  I had reached a new darkness of despair. That was just over a year ago now. I had finally made my peace and decided to open a window and see if I was ready to try again. 

I work with a girl that is gorgeous. However, we both have different goals and thoughts on life so we keep it professional. She had recently become single and I guess some of our conversations had been lost in translation. Leading to a corporate style text (in short) telling me to "fuck off and that it was unwelcome". My response (in corporate verbiage) "ok, cool. I'll just fuck off to my desk and wear blinders and a gag.". Safe to say that bridge is burned and will only lead to trouble. 

The second rejection is just as, if not better/worse. This one is just 36 hours before the last rejection. I text a girl I met at a bar a while ago, after not talking for a few months and ask if she wanted to get a burger and beer the next day with a date, time and location. Cut to a week after the planned dinner. "No" That's it. Nothing else. Two letters,  6 days later after ignoring me. Atleast she was to the point and quick about it. 

I'm not sure which is worse. The corporate text letter or a 6 days late rejection 😂😂😂😅😅😭😭😭. Safe to say I'm putting steel windows and doors up and welding them shut from the inside. Time to continue enjoying my unlimited gym time, nachos and pop. Who needs preworkout when you have heartbreak, self hatred and nothing but freetime😂😅😭. I guess I'm just meant to be alone 😔, not by choice unfortunately. That'd be too easy.
