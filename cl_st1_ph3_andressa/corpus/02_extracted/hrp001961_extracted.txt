Sometimes those nights come you want to sleep alone in your big dark room but you actually want to cry my chest is so heavy I wish I had some company I'm so lonely I just want to he held.. I want to be spoiled I want to feel loved..I'm a dude bdw I will keep going forward I'm strong in the day and night  though sometimes those nights come and I'm so weak .. I wish God mercy on me I have been sad and fighting lonelyness for long I won't give up though and I would keep dreaming until I get it or die on the way don't get me wrong I'm really thankful for what I have, even my Head is moking me singing this https://youtu.be/-buTMOR06ec?si=zbIa4CoBu9woL5FF
