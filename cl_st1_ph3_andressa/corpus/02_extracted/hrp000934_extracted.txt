For the fall, to Europe and I didn’t really get that excited feeling. I’m hoping that when the day comes I’ll be super happy and jittery, it’s something I’ve been wanted to for a super long time and I figured I might as well do it now instead of waiting for everything to be perfect.

I usually get super sad on my birthday about feeling invisible and all of that stuff. Maybe being in another country I won’t feel like myself? And I’ll be happier being physically in a place I’ve never been before.
