Hi I am 26 male still no one will take me serious whether it's a family or others so called friends. Some people will use me and after the work they don't even look at me. After multiple incidence I really feel that I am getting at trust issues and I suspect everyone. Even I am with so called friends they will plan everything but they don't even invite me even though I am sitting in front of them. Everybody thinks I am a circus joker. From the past 1 years I am finding hard to get socialised with people and I am going invisible. And this leading to get addicted to alcohol and cigarette. At finally I just decided that something wrong with me not a people. Please correct me if I am wrong.
