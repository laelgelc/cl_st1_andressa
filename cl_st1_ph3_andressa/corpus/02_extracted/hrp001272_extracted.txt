God tiktokers and their performative empathy is gonna be the end of me. You care about the environmental impact of Ai so instead of protesting against the companies and making some systematic change, you target vulnerable groups...? Instead of making the lonely person feel included you just reinforce the feeling they've felt their entire lives that led to them using ai in the first place? That's so counterproductive. 

All the comments are like "your loneliness is killing the planet" but you can say the same about a lot of different technology. Factory farming is unnecessary yet is far worse for the environment but statically most of these anti ai people aren't vegans. You don't hear me preaching "Your tastebuds are killing the planet lol!" everywhere tho. I will educate people on this but I will also understand that the average person living paycheck to paycheck doesn't have the privilege to go vegetarian the way i am. The same way some people don't have the privilege to experience real human connection.

And the way these people think we WANT to talk to Ai? Like we have put no effort to actually form human connection. I no i DON'T want to talk to a mindless yes man but do I have a choice? The comments are all like "you just don't try!!" "I have social anxiety too and I have friends!!" Like no jessica your quirky "teehee I'm too shy to talk to my crush" social anxiety isn't comparable to my diagnosed social anxiety that has made me feel like an alien in every social situation I've been in. I have fucking tried everything but this is very lucky based. 

I think I'm gonna kill myself
