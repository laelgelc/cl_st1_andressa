I [23M] have learned through therapy that loneliness is something that every struggles with at times. It affects everyone differently and there is no universal definition. I've been lonely since around 2020 after graduating high school and loosing touch with many of my friends through the years after. It doesn't help that pretty much the only place to meet people is at the bars especially when you dont drink. Its definitely been tough getting through these last 5 years. If any one needs someone to talk to im here. If anyone doesn't feel wanted or that the world would b3tter without them in it im here to tell you you matter and the world is a better place with you in it. Im proud of everyone especially those who push through even though they no longer want to live. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to do so.
