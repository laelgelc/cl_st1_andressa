I'm twenty years old female. I'm stuck at home with my family due to corna canceling University. I find my family is very type A perfectionist family. They spend so much time on career building and often haven't really gotten to know anything about me like my interests or anything. My family is loving but are often critical of me. I am not close to many people like I have three friends. I go random for roommates at school since I don't have anyone to live with. I like my solitude but I feel hurt that others don't want to be with me.
