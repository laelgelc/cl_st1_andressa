Everything I touch, I ruin. I don’t go around cussing and being rude, I want to help people, that’s all I’ve ever wanted but idk I guess I’m not good at it. I’ve never been the person to light up a room, can’t remember the last time I had a genuine smile. Idk man. Mid 20s and I’m just weak and fragile, wanting a family but also knowing I’m not ready for it nor am I a man to lead. If anyone reads this. You are loved. Beyond your imagination. Don’t give up. Keep seeking. I hope 2026 is the best year for you, dear reader. Keep moving forward.
