Hi I'm new and I've just discovered how great it is now I can communicate with similar people. I just want to say to begin with I do have friends but does anyone else feel like they aren't really your friends or maybe you're just a side character to them. Sometimes I believe it's because I like unorthodox shit and where I live being different sticks out like a sore thumb, so I've got no one who really understands where I come from and I always feel isolated. I apologise if I've gone over board a bit
