I'm around 30, but till today im incable of making friends with anyone. All my friends are one who were interested in me.

Any new person I normal talk, they talk it starts and then all of a sudden they find it difficult to continue friendship with me. Situation truly becomes awkward. I really don't intend to do that. I try to speak coming out fo my boundary. Not too much but still I put effort to talk. But I don't know what cues I give anyone to make things awkward with anyone.

This is not with one person but with everyone I meet. Is this because I talk freely in the beginning. But I don't know how to continue that sometime but still I try. But it end up awkward.

I want to seriously understand what wrong I'm doing to mess with everyone I meet.

I have read how to make friends and influenc people
I have read many articles
I have read about matching energy

But I don't know what wrong signal in throwing out to people. I have looks too.

I really need suggestions here.
