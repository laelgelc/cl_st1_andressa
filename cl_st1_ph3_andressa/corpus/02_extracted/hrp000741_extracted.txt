I always feel that I'm alone. It doesn't matter that I have friends from work or outside of it. I try my best to think I have it good, but at the end of the day, I feel lonely, and I can't change it. I always feel like disappearing, and I know that fact that nothing will change, and no one will care. Most importantly, this is the life I deserve for having this mindset. Any Advice on breaking out of this realm I put myself in, anything helps
