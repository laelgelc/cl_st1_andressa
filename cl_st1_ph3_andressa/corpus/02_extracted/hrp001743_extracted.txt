That’s what my life feels like. That’s what it feels like to be different. Every interaction is like you’re talking to a pre-programmed computer generated model, there’s never any sentience behind those eyes. Just like in a video game, you may be surrounded by plenty of NPC’s, but you still feel alone.. because you are. 

Anyone else feel that way?
