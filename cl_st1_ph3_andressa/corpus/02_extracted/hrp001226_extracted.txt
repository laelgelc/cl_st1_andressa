The more i get old the more i realise I never belonged, I just was there.

It seems like wherever I end up going, ill sort of end up moving on too fast somehow.

I never just stay and feel valued, understood and seen.

I dont know whats wrong with me.

Maybe i will always feel this way.

I feel stupid.
