I am 32 female married with 3 bio kids 1 step. I have friends yes and we do stuff together throughout the werk when we can but I still feel empty and alone. I have a husband but hes at work  5 days a week 8+ hours a day. And on the days off hes off with his friends so maybe a day i c him in the week. Once again i feel very alone and empty. I should be grateful but that doesnt chase this feeling away. What do other people do to fill the lonely empty gap.
