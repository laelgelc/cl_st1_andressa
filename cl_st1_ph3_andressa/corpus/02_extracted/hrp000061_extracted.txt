This is a huge weight off my shoulders. Online I’m an extrovert, loud, funny,etc. But in real life, it’s a whole other story. Whenever I walk around, I can’t help but feel judged. When I talk to someone, I can’t help thinking I said something wrong, or offended them. I guess you could say that I’m sensitive. I observe facial expressions too much, and often jump to conclusions. Basically, self-consciousness on steroids is social anxiety. Thanks for listening to rant. Have a nice day stranger!!!
