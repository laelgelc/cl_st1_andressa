Just today I had my usual checkup and they asked about my mental health (usually bad), and one of the tips for not feeling so depressed is to spend time with "loved ones"... That reminded me that literally two days ago I lost someone I considered a friend.

I don't have any friends in real life... I only talk to a couple of people online who I can't really call friends. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOCIALIZE ANYMORE. Unfortunately, I can't study yet or get a job to go out and meet people, even though I know that would suck.

I don't know how to talk to people in real life. I feel so damn alone. I don't have anyone I can trust in real life... I don't know what to do. I'm tired and really depressed. I'm scared of people, but I want to have friends. I've been trying to meet people since I dropped out of high school a year ago and nothing has worked out. It's awful.

I wonder what I did to deserve this loneliness. I feel like I'm meant to be alone.
