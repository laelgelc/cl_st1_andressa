I’m 22M. I used to be more social when I was younger, but after changing states after high school, everything changed. New place, new people, and no one around my age.

Academics became difficult, COVID made things worse, and over time I lost touch with friends. For the past few years, I’ve mostly been on my own.

I live with family, but it’s hard to talk about everything with them. I’m just trying to stay strong and move forward.

Not looking for sympathy—just wanted to share and see if anyone else relates.
