It’s been such a heavy day, and I honestly need a place to let this all out. I don’t expect a solution; I want to be heard.

Over the last two weeks, I (20M) have started talking to a girl I really like. She made my days feel brighter, gave me something to look forward to, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like there was a spark. We had a date planned (I mentioned this on another post I made here on Reddit), we were texting every day, and I genuinely thought things were going somewhere. But all of that suddenly fell apart, and it’s left me completely crushed.

Today was rough already. Swim practice didn’t go well, classes drained me, and emotionally, I just felt wrecked. Not to mention, 3-2 days prior, I just had my grandmother's funeral, and it was so emotionally challenging. But what hit me the hardest was this situation with her. It feels like everything I was excited about just disappeared in front of me. I know we hadn’t even met yet, but I poured so much of my heart into those conversations because they felt real.

Now it just feels like I’m 0-6 in my entire dating life. I’ve never even been on a real date. I watch people around me with their partners while I feel stuck, unwanted, overlooked, and left behind. I’m trying to keep my head up, I really am. But it’s exhausting. Some people make dating look so easy, and yet here I am, feeling like the universe is just laughing at me.

If anyone’s made it through something like this… how did you keep going? Because right now, I’m just trying to catch my breath.

Thanks for letting me share.
