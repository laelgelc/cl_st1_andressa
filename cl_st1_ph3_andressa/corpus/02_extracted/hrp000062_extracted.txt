I’m about to do dance and I’m bored so I’m just gonna spit out random facts about Irish dance as I think of them
Ive been doing dance since I was 5
The noisy shoes are called Hard shoes, heavy shoes, or treble shoes
The not noisy shoes are called ghillies or light shoes
My dance teacher taught me how to count to 10 in gaelic but idk how to spell them
Ireland was actually the first country to legalize gay marriage
Welp wasn’t that interesting I need to go dance now
