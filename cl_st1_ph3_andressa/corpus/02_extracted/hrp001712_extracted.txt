I always thought I'd have friends and be surrounded by people when I was younger, but now I know I'm not and it's making so much heartache. Seeing everyone around me have hangouts, birthdays, and just enjoying time with friends they've had since a kid is so envy inducing. Why didn't anyone want to stay around me? Why doesn't anyone miss me? I feel I'll be forgotten about as soon as I'm gone.
