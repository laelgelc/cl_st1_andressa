Hi, I’m in my mid 20s and life has taught me a lot through sickness, injury/bed rest, and career pressure. Somewhere along the way I lost time for things I once loved.

The hardest part was realizing many people stay only when you’re useful. When you need support, they disappear. I saw it with friends… and even my girlfriend left when I wasn’t stable.

If you’ve faced something similar or have any incident like this, please share.
