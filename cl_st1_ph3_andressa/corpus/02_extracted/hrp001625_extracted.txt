The past 4 to 5 years I've been pretty lonely for a variety of reasons, but i found that embracing the small bits of genuinely good social interactions has helped a lot. Even though I don't talk to friends that much or hang out with them at all, I find that when I focus on those more than the times when nobody is there, it makes coping a little easier. Also, just finding things to do alone that make you happy can help. There are times where the loneliness gets to me, but compared to 6 months ago I'm able to cope with it a lot more now and that had led to me being more confident and more willing to put myself out there. Also, don't be afraid to go out there and find new friends. I know cutting off old ones who really aren't there can be difficult and I know putting yourself out there and making yourself vulnerable to rejection is extremely hard as well. But rejection and inaction both lead to loneliness. There are billions of people on this planet and we are only exposed to a very minute amount of them in our personal lives. Don't find hobbies with the sole purpose of meeting friends or for relationships, find hobbies that even if nobody else wants to join you, that you can enjoy yourself. The mindset switch is not an overnight process and it's taken me a long time to deal with and it's difficult to maintain at times and it won't cure loneliness but it will go a long way with coping
