For the first couple years after high school (I am 21) things with my friends were great, normal. Then I got really depressed, and my friends started to drift apart, from ME in particular, to the point where they just stopped talking to me altogether but continued to hang out once in a while without me. And everyone I knew in high school started unfollowing me on instagram, and it just made me even more depressed. I was good for a while, thanks to medication and new hobbies, but I just spiraled over it again because of a realization that a bunch of people also unadded me on Snapchat. Its silly, I know, letting social media followings dictate so much of your self-esteem, but these werent strangers, you know? They were my friends.
I feel like theres a big gossipy conspiracy against me now, that theres something wrong with me that i dont know of but they do. Something unfixable, unforgivable. Or that i did something wrong and they wont tell me what it is, and have opted to just cut me out instead of trying to work it out. I wish people would just tell you when you did something wrong because my already low self confidence has hit the ground, and ive never felt more lonely, isolated, and hated. I feel so alone and yet I dont think I can put myself out there and find new friends because eventually those new friends will see the thing thats wrong with me and abandon me just like everyone else. I've come to whole-heartedly resent all the people I've once called my friends. I think I just have to accept the fact ill be lonely forever, unloved and unwanted. And maybe i did something to deserve all this.
