feeling debilitated.

i (25f) spend a lot of my days alone, and im sick of it!!!

i recently moved back to my home country after living abroad for 4 years - i started my first job, which i dont like. im here everyday 9-6 and i feel demotivated. 

i want to dedicate myself to writing/academic research/essays, but im feeling overwhelmed where to start.

i’m just out of a mini-1month-fling which had me feeling pretty dysregulated (my stuff in my dishwasher got moldy).

i discovered i think i have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, which makes it difficult for me to maintain romantic connections and consistent friendships,

though, it’s not like they’re volatile. more like, i have great long-term friendships and friends i see maybe once a week, but on a daily basis, im mostly alone. 

i’m tired!!!

i feel as though i’d love to express myself but i don’t really have a channel. 

i want to feel nice and in my power…

the gym and consistently eating well helps me a lot. 

i spend a lot of my time these days stuck in my head about the past and my family - i’m learning the concept of boundaries, which i’m enforcing, which is scary. i’m still a little dependent on them for money, which is fine, but i don’t want them to have a say in my career.

though at the same time, i want to feel grounded, i want people i trust around. weh! help! i’m a little lonely and lost. and maybe confused.

somatic healing helped me a lot - listening to my body’s cues. i go to therapy also, though it could be more often.

listen, i just want to enjoy myself, but i want it to be as *me.* i’m going through an intense past year of ego death i’d say, and i can’t stand the idea of performing. 

my next step - i want to express myself and put myself out there in a way i *enjoy* and in a way that connects me with people. please, possible? :)



just a little rant/ vent.
