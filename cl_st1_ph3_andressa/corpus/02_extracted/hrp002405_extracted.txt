I’m 20F. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I feel really stuck and tired. Idk I can get out of bed, I can talk to people, I can do mindless stuff, but the second I’m alone and try to focus on something real, I just shut down. I feel heavy, overwhelmed, and stuck.

I constantly feel this deep need to create something and do something meaningful with my life. I want to make things, express myself somehow. But I feel like I have nothing. No solid skills, no talents, nothing I stuck with long enough to become good at. As a kid, I kept switching one hobby to another, one musical instrument to another and I ended up mastering nothing. Now it feels like I’m left with emptiness and regret. For example now I want to learn 3D and create things, but I can’t make myself focus or work even for 15 minutes. The moment I try to do something productive, my brain shuts down and I feel overwhelmed. I end up doing mindless stuff instead, then hating myself for wasting time. It makes me feel lazy, broken, and useless.

Since covid, I’ve basically spent my life in my room, and I feel like I completely froze while everyone else kept moving forward. I feel behind socially, mentally, emotionally — like I missed important years of becoming a real person. I don’t feel like an adult, just someone who exists.

I have zero romantic or sexual experience, never even held hands romantically , never kissed, nothing. And honestly, this affects me more than I want to admit. It makes me feel unwanted, behind, and defective, i feel like even if i find someone they will be weirded out by me not having any experiences whatsoever.

What confuses me the most is that I don’t feel like I had any major trauma or anything that would “explain” why I’m like this. So I keep wondering.. am I just lazy?
