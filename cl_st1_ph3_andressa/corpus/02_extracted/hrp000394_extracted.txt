And not actually flirting with me. They never do. I’m the funny one with a good personality. I’m not one they want to date or get serious with. I haven’t had a date in 10 years. I wanted kids, a family. Instead, I am alone. One mediocre friend in my life, no parents and a sibling who has kids. My sibling never wanted to get married or have kids, until it happened. That was my dream, but they have it and I am left being the “fun” pibling (parent’s sibling). 

I’m not sure what I did in a previous life to deserve this loneliness, but I sure hope it was worth it. Days like today are getting harder to handle, especially the older I get. I want to scream that this isn’t fair. When has life ever been fair? 

So tonight, I mourn the life I wanted and realize this is all I get. By tomorrow, I’ll be back to my funny self and no one will know the tears that were shed for the life that doesn’t exist for me.
