Hi all, I’m curious if others experience this too…  
Sometimes I’m with friends or family, but I still feel disconnected, isolated, and like I can’t fully be myself. Social pressure and anxiety make even small tasks feel stressful. It’s like I’m trapped in my own head.  
Would love to know if anyone else relates.
