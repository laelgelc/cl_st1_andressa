I've posted here before. I feel like when people say they want to talk to you they're being nice, they have no interest in you as a human person. Do you feel people just want to be nice but quickly feel your becoming a burden to well intentioned strangers on the internet? I spend to long trying to decide what to type, to say to internet people. Whenever I try to go on some sort of social app, I get self conscious about the way I look, ik that sounds obvious. I have no friends, no boyfriend, completely lack a social life for YEARS. I go out of my way to avoid social interaction when I'm on my walks. I used to tell myself I'm just an extreme introvert. I have this image of who I am or who I wish to be, and when I'm with people I'm familiar (my parents and siblings) with I can be confident, outspoken, who I've always believed myself to be. But when I'm alone, on a walk for instance or at the doctor, I get shy, timid, quiet and nervous. I feel like I'm going to be thirty (I'm nineteen) and still live like this, with my parents, rarely leaving the house. I go through on and off depression, anxiety stemming from my ocd. Ive been held back because of it and I'm still in high school. I feel like giving up. When people on here ask if you just want to talk I feel like it's out of niceness not real interest in being my friend, do you feel like this too? In my last post I ended with something like I don't know what I'm asking for but it still stands. I find myself constantly checking Reddit for people respondibg to my post. I want to have the life I've always wanted but I don't see myself being that happy.
