It's just so painfully lonely for me all the time. I am 23 f, I don't have friends, don't have partner, like I am by myself all the time. There's not a single fuckin person at my uni who is genuinely interested in knowing me. Even my roommates don't talk to me. I don't know why. It's painful when people around you are talking and laughing with each other but no one is even looking at you. It's just painful to not be seen or heard. I feel like i am lacking something very fundamental which makes me human. I don't know how many days I can bear this.
