I just returned to a place I lived for 7 years with a guy I currently work with. We came here for work. I left about 2 years ago. When we arrived at the hotel, he said "well, you probably are going to go hang out with all your friends, so I'll see you tomorrow." That really made me feel like shit because I never really made any. I'm currently eating wings and playing trivia by myself at Buffalo wild wings..
