I think my anxiety has gotten the best of me. I know it sounds as if I’ve given up hope, but I haven’t. I’ve just let it linger for so long it tends to win over me. A new problem has arrived, and my instinct of running away is set off. The problem is not being able to perform daily duties because my anxiety spikes and my harmful thoughts spiral. Today I had to present myself—and no, I did not do well. In a sense I did have the courage to stand up and introduce myself, but I was shaking, and my voice was so shaky; I felt like leaving the class. My only escape/excuse was a pity laugh on my part and me telling the teacher, “I get nervous when I perform in front of others.” From then on I felt judged, but I don’t care what they think. It’s my head that throws the hate that gets me down so bad, and it’s hard because it cripples me to the point where I feel like I can’t get better. That I should just BOOM. Would it just not make this all go away? This anxiety might never leave me. I was going to apply to a job, but this voice just keeps on going, and the scenarios are the worst. How do I move on? Make some improvements in my life. Should I just get the job as a cashier or as a helper—and let them see how much I shake and how fragile I am? So I get made fun of. That I can’t do anything right. That every choice I make is foolish. It’s so irksome. Maybe I just need rest🫩. But this just genuinely drains me so bad that I want to lash out at everyone and just drown in my sorrows. I just hate myself. Why can’t people just let people be… (I feel bad because people live way worse, and they do anything to be in my shoes.) I also got no friends to talk to about any of this—well, I thought I did, but they just abandoned me, or maybe I wasn’t reaching out enough. Idk, really. I just want to stop feeling sorry for myself and crying like a sensitive person.
