I always feel like I really want to talk to someone, to hang out, relax and enjoy someone else's company but everytime I'm around other people I feel stressed out. It feels like I can't help but slip into some other persona that I think they'll approve of and it's exhausting. Even around family I can't make conversation without it feeling like a performance. I'm so tired and so alone but I can't see any way to change my situation. I'm not really expecting any advice on this, just wanted to say it so it wasn't just spinning around in my own head.
