Hey guys, I’ve lived in the city for years and realized how hard it is to just find someone to grab a coffee with or spot you at the gym if your friends are busy.
So I built this: Buddy2Buddy.
It’s a marketplace for platonic companionship. We are currently looking for people who want to sign up as "Buddies" (to earn money by socializing).
I just designed this landing page. Does it get the message across, or is the "Rent a Friend" text too aggressive for an Indian audience?
