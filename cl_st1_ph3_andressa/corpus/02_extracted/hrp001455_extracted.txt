I don’t think I am truly alone, mainly because I have built a following on YouTube and those people despite not knowing me personally actually care about what I do and find my other hobbies I share interesting. I think it’s lack of any in person interaction that’s what makes me feel this way I’m just stuck either in my room feeling stressed or bored or I leave to my rather small college every Tuesday and Thursday just for a few hours and then leave and the cycle is just repetitive and I feel like I am losing myself with basically no one apart from my mom to talk to in person
