I made a man the center of my life, and I deeply regret it. Now, I’m left with no friends, no hobbies, no talent, no marriage, and no one to turn to or run to. I don’t even have a family. I don’t have a mother to cry to when times get tough. He has friends, he has a family, didn’t make me the center of his life, and he has goals. I was just so in love with him. Before that, I had a job, acquaintances, and hobbies. I was someone—a young woman with aspirations. Now, I’m left with nothing. I don’t even have goals, aspirations, or a job. What on earth do I do? I feel so alone. I made him the center of my life for years. I have no education and I’m not good at anything.
