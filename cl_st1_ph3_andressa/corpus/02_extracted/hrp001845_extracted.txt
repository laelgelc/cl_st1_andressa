guys im first year uni and its already second semester and still haven’t found my DESTINED friend group that i’ve been waiting for my whole life nor a real best friend to go side quests or hang out or study or text or facetime. i’ve been to clubs/societies, talk to coursemates, people in my class, literally anyone and no one at all 🫩 idk when was the last time i used my voice 😭💀 this generation in uni is just so anti-social like i see alot of this post in reddit, tiktok. why does no one wanna hang out anymore
