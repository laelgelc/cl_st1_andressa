It's hard not to think that I'm being sabotaged. Yes, maybe my introversion and reluctance for socializing makes my already limited pool of possible friends/dates tiny. But even in these circumstances there always comes someone (one person) every couple of years who pops into my life that i almost effortlessly connect with. Then fall in love with (or grow very attached), then learn the obstacles that make staying close or getting anywhere significant with them impossible. Until comes the same ending to every one of them. Things break apart or I MUST let things fade for morality's sake.

It just seemed to be a pattern for the past decade, so it feels like design, you know? A pattern designed to end the same lonely way, that I can't beat. It sucks.
