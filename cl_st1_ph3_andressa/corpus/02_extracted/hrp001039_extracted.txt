I’m currently on gap year between my second and third tested at uni. For a while I’ve struggled with my mental health. I have adhd and autism and have spent many years undiagnosed knowing I was different to everyone else. It’s left me very behind in life I have very little social exposure and few friends. I’ve struggled hard to find myself and still continue to struggle. I’m deeply very lonely as I’ve never had any long term long lasting relationships and people often hard it hard to understand me. I love anything sport, particularly football, rugby and cricket and have no friends who share the same interests which can be very boring for me
