I may be overreacting, but today I woke up sick with a sore throat and strong headaches, so I wanted to stay in bed. Then I asked my roomie if she could bring me something from brunch since I wasn’t going and she said sure. Now she came back and was still eating something, but didn’t bring me anything. If I want to eat something now I’ll have to wait till dinner or just eat ramen. This really dissapointed me cuz I just asked for something simple. This just keeps getting to me in a way that nobody cares or thinks about me and it just makes me so sad.
