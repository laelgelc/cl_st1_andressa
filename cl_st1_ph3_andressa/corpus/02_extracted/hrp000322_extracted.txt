I am 20 years old and I have been depressed for the last 3–4 years. Even after coming out of depression, it has left a big impact on me and has made my physical health worse. I don’t know whether I am still depressed or not, but I still get negative thoughts sometimes, and I have almost lost my emotions or feelings.

Talking about my recent situation, I’m really not feeling good. I really need someone to understand me—someone who can take care of me or at least care about what disappoints me. I have literally lacked support, love, and care from my family. I was ditched by my best friends, and slowly I lost even having a good friend. When I fell into my depression phase, my friends stepped away from me at my lowest point.

After friends and family, I have my boyfriend, but I feel that he gives more importance to his friends than to me. He takes me for granted, and he has done that many times. He always disappoints me, which hurts a lot. He doesn’t understand me, especially when it comes to his friends. He even disappointed me on my birthday. I don’t find him supportive anymore.

I feel so lonely because I have lacked love and importance from my family, lacked loyalty from my best friends, and now I’mIacking understanding from my boyfriend. I don’t know what action I should take or how I should treat him back for this.

Overall, I am really disappointed with my life and feel extremely lonely. I truly need someone to understand me and care about me.
