Been a loner from time, lots of traumatic Events growing up but I’m super close to my siblings mostly my immediate elder sister and weirdly have a lot of friends and good will with a lot of people. I guess I’m lucky but ultimately I love solitude I really don’t mind being alone forever with access to all the music and movies I love and gears I need to keep my passions alive 😂😂 being alone is first nature. Being communal is second nature. So lucky I’m highly empathetic which makes me super intuitive which is another reason for being alone cause my environment and those around me rub off deeply when it comes to me. So I’m order to protect my peace and that if those I love I’ve learnt to keep the distance but the love, connections and bonds are all genuine cause no matter how distant I may seem I’ll go to any lengths for those I hold dear and I really don’t expect it back in return. It’s my choice to be proper and invested in their lives and to want the best outcome for them. But I still love my space and most have grown to respect that. I do the visiting I don’t get visited that way I can maintain my solitude 😌🏝
