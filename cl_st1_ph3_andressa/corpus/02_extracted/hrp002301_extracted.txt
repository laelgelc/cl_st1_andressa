I’m losing hope, I’ve been injury ridden for 5 months. Went into massive debt, got kicked out of my house, and I almost have work. Everytime I almost have work it gets ripped away. I’m almost 20. The last 4 days I haven’t left my bed other than to do human things. I know it gets better, I know blah blah blah just want some words of encouragement..
