I’m (20M) and today I feel lonelier than usual. Today is my birthday and it feels strange. Only one person congratulated me, and none of my family has. On top of that, I’ve been sick with the flu for 4 days, so I don’t even have the energy to do anything.  
I’ve lived a lonely life all these years, and it’s something I’ve gotten used to. About 3 years ago, I met a girl on Discord in a community a friend created. We were friends for about a year, and then we became long-distance partners. It was a beautiful relationship that lasted a year. But the relationship ended on her side, while I still loved her and wanted to continue, since the problem wasn’t between us but something external. The breakup happened during the first week of November (right when our anniversary was coming up). It hit me really hard because with her I didn’t need anyone else to socialize with. I had friends, with whom I’m still in touch, but I haven’t had anyone else to socialize with at the level I did with her. (In my family, I was raised in a way where we don’t usually talk about our feelings.) With her, I could tell her about my day, what I did, what I wanted to do. She told me about her life, about her dreams, which also became mine, because before I met her I was totally lost, without dreams or goals, and she made me dream.

It’s been about 10 months since the breakup, and honestly the only thing I’ve missed is having that kind of connection again. I don’t miss her; I miss what I could do with her and the fact that I could open up emotionally to someone else. Also, because of how my family treated me during childhood, it’s really hard for me to open up emotionally to other people and be sociable.

Sorry if this isn’t well structured, but it’s just what I’m thinking in the moment.
