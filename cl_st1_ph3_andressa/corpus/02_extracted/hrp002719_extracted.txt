Ive always been the quiet type. I do much better with one on one situations than big groups of people. I have a 7 year old son that is autistic and ever since I had him i cant help but feel like i might be undiagnosed autistic. Around certain people i can talk like crazy but if im around new people i tend to completely shut down. Can anyone else relate?
