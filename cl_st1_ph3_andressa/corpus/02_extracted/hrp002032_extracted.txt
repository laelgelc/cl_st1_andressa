I’m in a college apartment and it’s the first birthday I’ll ever had to spend alone. I can’t even go anywhere really because I don’t have a car. And I feel useless and I just wish someone were here with me🥺 I haven’t been able to stop crying for the past few days, as every birthday goes. Because I’m scared that I’m not going to live it up well, and the when it passes I’m equally sad that I spent so much time dreading it. I just want a hug it hurts so bad :(

I’m introverted, but I’m so bothered because I’ve never felt actual loneliness before. And this sucks.

EDIT: wow you all are so sweet 🥺 I’m in tears thank you so much
