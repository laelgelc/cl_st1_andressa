So I am a man who grew up in a single parent family. Meaning I have never had any other family members outside of just my mom.. she passed when I turned 18 and now (24) I am a year into a relationship with a woman with a fairly decent size family. I feel very alone and out of place when my spouse mingles amongst her family. Like I tend to sit alone quietly during the gatherings.. I don't say anything unless spoken to because I'm so afraid of saying something dumb or embarrassing myself (which normally isn't an issue Infront of people I don't care to know or to leave a good impression on.). Any tips on what I should do to feel less alone or to make it easier to mingle. Btw my spouse doesn't really talk to me or introduce me either.
