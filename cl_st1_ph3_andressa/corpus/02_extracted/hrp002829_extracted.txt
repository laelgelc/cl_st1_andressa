All,

I have just signed up for a [webinar](https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2018/05/you-dont-have-to-be-alone-to-be-lonely.html) this Tuesday at 1 PM EDT.  It will feature a public health official and, most excitingly, a key researcher in the field \-\- Julianne Holt\-Lunstad.  It's free to register and I don't think you need to be a medical worker.  For the "title" and "company" fields I just put where I worked and what my job title was \(definitely NOT a medical place!\) and I got in.

This is very exciting to get this kind of validation from the medical community.  I hope others can join and we can discuss afterward.
