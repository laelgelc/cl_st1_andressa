Most of this year, I have been asking the same question. Sometimes they seem good, they care about me, then they are gone, no calls, no messages, not inviting me to hangouts(childhood friends btw), like 6 months ago I asked one of my close friends Why didn't u invite me? I'm mostly free. He \*assumed\* that I would not come, I changed the topic because I didn't know how to react, their words tell that we are your best friends, you are one of the homies etc, but they never seem to act like friends. I didn't message them for a while, no messages, no calls, nothing. I have been going through a tough time my father had cancer, surgery was like 2 months ago, i told one of them about this, he didnt even ask how my father was or how i am doing, and he was just meeting me because he proposed a girl, and after she became his gf its like i dont even exist. i dont know what to expect from them or what do they expect from me, no physical interaction feels good, in the back of my mind i always thnking about going home. i only go with groups if something i like is going on and still there too i feel alone its like i came on my own to just do this , idk maybe im just dumb or too sensitive i thought someone could say something because i have no one to talk to.
