I have so much going around and as always i know no one who is going through some or all things i am going through. I have lot of original thoughts, and i go crazy if i feel something in my life or in the world is unfair. i am normal though if i talk it out but i have no one. talking to pillow doest help, i dont have a cat, writing still messes with my head. what do you do? how do you calm yourslef down? i know I cant always talk to a random person or a long lost friend
