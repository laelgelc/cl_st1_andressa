I actually lose the last few people that I had in my life that were friends. My birthday was September 3rd. Lost 2 people that day and the other 2 the day after.

Mind you, they didn't die ha. They just left. Over things that could have been talked about. Nothing big, nothing serious. 

Now I have nobody.
