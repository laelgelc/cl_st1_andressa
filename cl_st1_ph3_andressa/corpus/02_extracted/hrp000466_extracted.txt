apologies for this stream of consciousness.  


I tried to show up for a Christmas party. Someone I am seeing’s family was hosting, and I had crippling anxiety for days before. I didn’t want to go, I knew I shouldn’t, but I wanted to break out of my painful norm of isolation.

  
I look different from everyone in this city; I am tattooed and pierced. I groom myself well but I’m in a conservative town, mostly white, and I’m mixed with tan skin. 

  
I know how to read “vibes,” when there’s that palatable discomfort due to my presence. I get it a lot here. When I walk into rooms, I’m the only one like me. Only been here a year, and this city is killing me.

I have spent every holiday alone. because of an abusive family I escaped. Alone is sacred, especially on holidays when there was a ton of  perpetual misery.

  
So when I agreed to go to the Christmas party, I could feel my dread rise not only from my place of historical trauma, but from intuition.   


I arrived at the holiday party and no one got up from the couch to greet me. They stared and clenched. I politely tried to be a pretty statue of guest and the discomfort was clear. They weren’t used to having my kind round here - I politely ate dinner and tried to ignore the fact that I was being ignored. No one made eye contact with me.  I felt wretched. Ugly. I excused myself and called a lyft home. I realized again, I am alone, in this city; in this life. But the kind of alone that feels too good to malign.

  
I realized there are those people  out there that get on in life being in line with norms, social good— they’re pretty and well liked. They win.

  
There are those of us who walk in the wind and brace  our own steps when theres no hand to hold. 

Honestly, I can sense the beauty of life better when the air is clear of other people‘s thickness and ignorance. I don’t want it any other way.

  
So, if you’re alone. right now. we can be alone together. it’s a beautiful thing.
