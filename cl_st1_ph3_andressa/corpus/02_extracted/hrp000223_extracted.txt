Any queer girls/enbies on here? I feel like I’m the only lesbian xD

My long-time gf and I just broke up and I haven’t talked to another lgbt person in like… eons. My name is Alex, I’m 19, enby trans-Masc, and I love rock music & nature. My favorite show is JJBA, and I love to draw. 
Gay guys hit me up too, I need some friends <3
