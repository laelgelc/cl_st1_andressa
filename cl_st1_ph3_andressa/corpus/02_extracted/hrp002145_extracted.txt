I have had no friends since elementary school and I think covid made it worse. I don't blame myself for not being more outgoing but even if I was there are no people in my area that I would want to be my friend. (not even being picky just lacking general common interests) I have been single my whole life and that is hard because I'm closeted and if I flirt with a guy he will either think I'm weird or get mad over something homophobic or some other insecure shit. want a friend that stays I've made two good friends one after the other and they both moved away and got back with other friends and we grew apart and its no hate to them they are amazing good people that deserve the world but it sucks that the best friends that i have made i was just a passing phase in their lives and they stayed in the state for a grand total of 5 months MAX.
