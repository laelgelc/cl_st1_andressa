I had a dream I met someone from Reddit lol. And they didn’t realize it was me I mean they didn’t even know I was there. I recognized a picture they sent me of where they were eating at and I went there lol. Kinda stalkery, I know. But I just observed. And lately I’ve been having dreams where I’m meeting people, and even though the dreams can be weird it makes me sad to leave these dreams.
