I feel like I’m going insane I have a feeling like I want to scratch my mind from the inside… I keep imagining myself putting my hands all over my face then pulling my hair and screaming while fast forwarding, and pulling a gun then shooting myself in the head. I’ve been crying for no reason, getting angry ( even beat up my brother over it ), getting hyper and my anxiety is bad I can’t sit in one place not to mention my smoking addiction is through the roof I smoke every second of every day cigarettes, vape, sometimes shisha, recently nicotine pouches.

I want or need a friend, I want someone to tell me they love me, a friend to always talk to, play text games together, maybe call each other, share pics, vent to each other, send insta reels, share socials, actually gimme their real name, replies fast and is always there for me, isn’t toxic and doesn’t ghost etc 

It’s so hard to find this friend on here… but if I don’t, I feel like I’ll lose it.
