Hi, 

I'm 35 from London UK,  living in such a large city can be incredibly lonely at times and I do get that there will be days when life is more isolated, it would be fine if it were once in a while.  

I can literally go months without any family or old friends reaching out to me.  

My life has gotten significantly worse over the last 5 years, 

Starting in 2020 when the entire country was forced into a year of lockdowns, all of my work dried up, I wasn't eligible for the government schemes such as furlough or the business support schemes and had zero income. 

I had no option but to claim universal credit at £400pm or $500 equivalent. I also had to use the little savings I had. 

When I finally returned to work, I caught covid 2 months later, almost died when my oxygen dropped to 60%. I also developed covid related pneumonia and was hospitalised for 18 days.  

I spent 11 days in intensive care on oxygen, couldn't eat for 20 days lost 14kg during 20 days and had to be out on a feeding tube.  

It took me 6 months to recover from it as I couldn't work, walk, go out, go gym or do anything.  

Since then I have endured the following.  

A foot injury, plantar faciitis after trying to get into running. 

2 chest infections

Covid 2nd time 

Flu

2 lung infections 

Covid 3rd time

Unrequited feelings for someone

Then in 2025 I was attacked, victim of a pickpocket attempt, caught the thief, he turned agressive trying to fight me, so I defended myself and ended up breaking my finger. 

Theres been times ove wondered if it had been best I didnt survive in 2021 and being so isolated doesnt help.  

My entire life consists of working full time, going gym, coming home to work on my private side hustles. 

I want to have some normality and have a real people to meet with and then hopefully also find someone romantically to settle down 

Anyone london based?
