I have never felt so lonely before. Someone just called to ask for some soft loan and as she was asking on how to pay back I felt I have connected with her.I have never felt so relieved.At this point I don't have any friends and my family seems not to relate to what am going through.So much pressure on you need to get married from work to home to a point I feel so lonely.And, have you tried dating and realised it's not working they all blame you.
