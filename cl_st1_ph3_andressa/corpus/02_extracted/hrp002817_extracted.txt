I'm on my way to a meeting with some researchers / a professor in the field of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning with a special focus on societal issues. Among others I wanted to talk to them about our Unalone project. Any thoughts / ideas?

I particularly think about the idea of a buddy system where Machine Learning helps to finds and proposes the right "buddies".
