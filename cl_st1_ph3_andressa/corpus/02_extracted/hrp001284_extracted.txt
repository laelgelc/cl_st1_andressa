23F, I don't know where to begin. Something about not having any close female friendships is killing me. Over the years since middle school, high school, and now college I have not been able to maintain one close female friendship or any friendship for that matter. It's never anything more than acquaintances. It's eating me away. When I'm not around my bf I feel sickened with loneliness. I've forced myself outside of my shell and I know that I am able to talk with people and have genuine conversations but the friendships never last or are never genuinely close. I want to fill the void with people with similar interests as me but I seem to never find them. Sorry, I just don't know where else to share this :(
