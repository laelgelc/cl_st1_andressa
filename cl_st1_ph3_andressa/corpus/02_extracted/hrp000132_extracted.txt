If y’all don’t mind I just need someone to tell this to and I have no one else. Today was a big day for me, I had an event that marks a big achievement in my career/education (similar to uni graduation but a post-grad industry specific thing). 

My siblings couldn’t come so it was just me and my parents.  I specifically asked my parents to take nice photos. I had my mum take photos for me before the ceremony and asked her to take some during. She took 9 photos. 9 all up. And they are all terrible. 
We go out for lunch afterwards and my mum complains the whole time, my parents are taking shots at each other at every opportunity and are both on their phones throughout while I just sit there in silence. We had just gotten our drinks and my mum was complaining about something and then after a few sips goes “oh yeah, cheers, congratulations” and then went right back to complaining. 
This is a big event and traditionally people get flowers and gifts to commemorate. I got nothing. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful but my parents literally said “we didn’t know what to get you so we got nothing.” 
It really hurts when it feels like your family don’t try for you but you really try for them. 
Anyway, if anyone is looking for friends/someone to chat to hit me up.
