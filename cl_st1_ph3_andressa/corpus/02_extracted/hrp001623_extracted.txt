Hey everyone, I wanted to share something I’ve been working on—[BondBridge](https://www.bondbridge.online/signup?referral=1VF1NK). It’s an AI-powered platform designed to help people connect in a more meaningful way, especially for those who feel isolated or struggle with social anxiety.

I noticed how disconnected a lot of people feel, even with social media, and wanted to create a space where people could form real friendships without the pressure or awkwardness. The AI matches you with others who share similar vibes and interests, and you can chat privately, securely, or anonymously if that’s more comfortable.

I’m really proud of how it’s helping people build connections in a time when loneliness is such a big issue. The browser version is up now, and the mobile app will be available soon. If you’re looking to meet people and make real connections, feel free to check it out. It is, and will be, completely free.
