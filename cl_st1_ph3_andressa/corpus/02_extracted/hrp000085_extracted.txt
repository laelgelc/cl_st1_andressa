so i have been feeling super isolated lately. I’m usually always a loner but when i started working from home it really effected my
mental. I quit that job and now feel a little better. I’ve been trying to make more friends.. but when i hang out with them, they get on my nerves and i just want to go back to being alone… I know i need to focus on my goals. My focus is everything right now.. but then i feel lonely. What’s wrong with me? 

“it’s lonely at the top” huh?
