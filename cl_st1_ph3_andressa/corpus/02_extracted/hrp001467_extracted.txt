The only friends I have are on a group server at the moment, and although I have a lot of them, I talk to none one to one, nor am I close with any of them. I’ve even mentioned this and instead of any kind of conversation I just get, “feel free to reach out when you’re having a hard time”. Like, I don’t want to be your friend when I need help, I just want to be your friend.

People say hi to me on this group server and chat, but none care enough to seek out real friendship in me, nor care enough to reciprocate anything I’m trying to put out. 

I’m the guy you invite to a game to fill up space on your team. That’s it. That’s all I’m good for right now.

I’ve been there for 6 months now, and I don’t think anything’s gonna change anytime soon, nor do I know if I can change that. 

How do I come to terms with the fact that people like me in general, but not enough to care about me as a person?
