Honestly, at 25, I suddenly realized that I’ve never really had true friends. I’ve had acquaintances, people around me, but never anyone I could just meet in the evening for coffee or a glass of wine and talk openly, without masks or pretenses. Never friends I could share little joys or big fears with.

The closest person in my life was my husband. He was my support, my friend, the person I trusted with everything—my thoughts, my struggles, my happiness, and my pain. And now we’re divorcing, and he’s with someone else. That feeling of emptiness sometimes hits me so hard it feels like the whole world has disappeared.

I don’t know how new relationships will form, how communication with my child will go, how life will go on. Everything feels strange and unfamiliar, and for the first time, I truly realize that I simply have no one to share with. And in that loneliness comes the truth: in 25 years, I never built friendships that could be a real support, like my husband once was.

It’s difficult and scary, but there’s truth in it too: now I see that I’ll have to learn to be there for myself, to be my own support, to find joy in small things, and to open myself to new connections. And maybe, someday, I’ll find friends—people I can simply be myself with.
