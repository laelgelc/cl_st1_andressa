My name is Ellie and I wanted to let you know that we still have spaces for persons aged 75+ in the UK  to sign up for a phone buddy via our free call companion service: [Find a call companion: phone befriending & companionship (reengage.org.uk)](https://www.reengage.org.uk/join-a-group/get-a-call-companion/)

We need a little help reaching those who are older and isolated, so if you are aware of any older people (75+) within your community, you can refer them to Re-Engage charity (with their consent, of course) for support. Referrals can be made quickly and easily through the online form, accessible via the following link: [www.reengage.org.uk/refer/form/](http://www.reengage.org.uk/refer/form/) and select Call Companions, or check out our other services.

Please help over 75s find connections and tackle loneliness- [ellie.plummer@reengage.org.uk](mailto:ellie.plummer@reengage.org.uk) our volunteers are DBS checked and trained by the charity Re-engage
