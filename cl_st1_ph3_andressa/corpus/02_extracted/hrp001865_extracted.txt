I guess it’s post-covid college, but man is it hard to meet people in college. I show up to class and everyone avoids each other like the plague. Don’t even think about talking to cute girls in class, they’re knee deep in their phones and sitting in the corner of the class avoiding everyone there. My social circle died during covid and going to school was supposed to be where I could rebuild connections. Nope. Even in the hallways and on campus, everyone actively avoids each other unless they’re already familiar with each other. How the hell am I supposed to meet people outside of instagram and snapchat if I go to college and everyone treats you like a weirdo if you even dare approach and introduce yourself?
