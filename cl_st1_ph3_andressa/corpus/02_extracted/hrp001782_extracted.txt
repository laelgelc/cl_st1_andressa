I hate faking my emotions 

At times I can’t take it anymore 

I see people so happy and theirs me numb dumb and emotionally available. I can’t cry anymore over time it dried out like a lake , reaching out for help and advice just tears me apart even more cause they look at me then feel sorry for me. idk what to say anymore sorry for trying to express a little bit but it’s just to confusing
