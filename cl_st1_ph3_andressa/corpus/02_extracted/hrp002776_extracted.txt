I'm in my 40s, have been a loner all my life. I have a small circle of friends, but only see them once or twice a year. We don't text or keep in touch otherwise. I am happily married and spend my time either alone with my hobbies or with my family. Don't have a social life to speak of. I don't use social media other than reddit.

My one regret with not having close friends is that it would be potentially embarrassing for my family when it's time for my funeral and no one comes.
