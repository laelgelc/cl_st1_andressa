I’m surrounded by people sometimes but still feel completely alone.
I’m introverted and deal with a lot of anxiety.
I don’t get much respect, not socially and definitely not romantically.
Girls don’t notice me or they dismiss me. Some people joke about me. Others just ignore me like I’m background noise.
Over time that stuff gets inside you.
You start doubting your value.
You feel small. Ashamed. Like your existence doesn’t matter much.
What makes it harder is that most advice out there doesn’t work for people like me.
It’s all “change your mindset” or “fake confidence until it works.”
But faking it just made me feel worse. More disconnected.
I don’t have a solution.
I just know that pretending to be someone else isn’t it.
If you’re reading this and feeling that same quiet loneliness, I see you.
I really do.
