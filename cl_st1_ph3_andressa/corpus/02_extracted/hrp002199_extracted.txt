I feel like I wanna be around people.. but then I feel like a constant outcast . I feel like a nobody . I feel like a burden . I feel like people just want me to go away . But I wanna be around people so bad… but the again I don’t cause I feel like I drag them down with my crying and depressional issues… I always feel like if I tell someone, “I’m just- really sad” they’ll think I’m stupid and then say, “well get over it” . Like… okay yeah let me just switch off my emotions for you . 

Idk how to feel….
