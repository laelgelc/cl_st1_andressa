I'm in an American graduate program. And I arrived 2 minutes late to class today. Now, obviously punctuality is universal. It's not okay to arrive to school/work/whatever it is late. But I came in two minutes late. The professor told me to come in. the professor went on this whole rant about how important it is to arrive on time. How this won't fly in the real world. I'm taking neurogenic disorders (essentially a class that helps people recover from strokes and TBIs). He said "we must use our executive function to arrive on time and plan ahead."

I was so embarrassed. Everyone heard. And I started crying immediately. I tried to keep it discreet. But I had to leave to the restroom about 30 minutes later to cry. I tried coming back. And I did for a little over an hour (the class is 3 hours long). I don't know what it is about me. Whenever I get really upset, when I start crying, I can't stop crying. They spent the last 45 minutes or so again in the restroom. And I only came back to get my stuff once I knew class ended.
