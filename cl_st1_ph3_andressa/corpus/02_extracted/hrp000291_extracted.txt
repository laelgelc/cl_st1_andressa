I’m lost my friends more times then i can count but looking back… they weren’t friends and we barely shared things in common… i’m in college right now and thought i could meet people with at least half the interest i do and realized i’m in a small town with a community college and no one lives on campus (including myself) so that was a bust too. I find my self searching for people on my pc through discord but all servers already have established their groups and etc. So i made my own and i’ve waiting for peeps to roll in like me but again, I’ve ran in a circle to where i started. I Just started anti depressants and adderal, I just hope they work better than trying to look for a real human connection like we used to all do in 2011-2016 to feel like i’m grounded again, instead of floating through life day by day.
