I’m 26 and have no familial community. I’m the youngest in my family and my mom’s side isn’t the greatest compared to my dads side. I’m 9 months postpartum and my mom has taken me to court once already because I took my brother in after she threw boiling water on him and threw the cup at him giving him a contusion. 

Here’s the last text my mom sent to me. Blurred out my partners name that’s the only thing I did. 

I’m an open book really and if anyone has questions that I deem are appropriate enough to answer I will. 

But my dad is in my life and a present grandfather who’s retired and traveling, I’m in therapy and just alone after getting cheated on during my pregnancy and just feel so isolated.
