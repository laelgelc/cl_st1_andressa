Just turned 23 Last year on December. I don’t really know why I’m writing this. Maybe because tonight it hit me again. I’m sitting in my room again, lights off, door closed, just me and the silence. I graduated three years ago, but I don’t have a job yet. I’m living at home, spending my father’s money, doing nothing useful,and every day I hear it the reminders, the criticism, the frustration dripping from every word my parents throw at me. I hear them complain about me sitting here, doing nothing, wasting my life. Every word feels like a weight pressing down on my chest. I eat in my room. I scroll my phone to feel busy. I watch YouTube and doing doomscrolling all the day abd night to just to hear human voices, to trick myself into thinking I’m not entirely invisible. I go for walks when no one’s around very rarely. I keep quiet. I disappear into corners, into the shadows, because every glance feels like judgment, every moment a reminder that I am not enough. Some nights, I cry quietly under my blanket. Not because I’m weak, not because I want pity but because it physically hurts to exist in a space where i feel unwanted, unneeded, unloved and unseen. I try to pretend I’m okay, but inside, it screams. Inside, I ache to be anywhere else, anyone else’s priority, even for one hour. People say learn to enjoy your own company. But it’s not that simple. Sometimes it’s just surviving. Surviving the silence. Surviving the words that make me feel small. Surviving the way the world, even at home, makes me invisible. I just survive in the quiet, counting the hours until the house sleeps, until I can close the door and cry until my chest hurts, until the world can’t see the pieces of me I can’t hold together. I dont need advice. I don’t need cheer up or you’ll be fine.I just want to know if anyone else feels this the weight of loneliness while living at home, the sting of judgment for simply existing, the quiet, endless ache of feeling like you don’t matter. If you relate, even one me too would mean the world tonight for me.
