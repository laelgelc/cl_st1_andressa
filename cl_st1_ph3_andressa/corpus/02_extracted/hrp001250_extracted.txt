Of late, I've been seeing a bunch of posts talking about how the men's posts go unnoticed, and the women's posts get more traction (ofc, it's a different matter that most of that attention is of a bad kind... so it's not like the women have a super-duper good time, that's not the point of this post)... but I just feel the men are more unheard... i won't make big promises, but I'm here to lend an ear to any male who wants to talk about their struggles, share what they're feeling, or is just looking for a casual chat. You don't have to be alone! Ofc, women can hmu too, but I wanted to specifically help out the men as they have a slightly harder time.
