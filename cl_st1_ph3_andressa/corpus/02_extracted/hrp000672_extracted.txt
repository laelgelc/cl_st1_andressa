I feel like I’m not great at expressing my feelings but I wrote (what I thought was) a very eloquent, positive, and poignant statement but was unfortunately totally deleted. Anyway. All I want is to be loved, which I truly thought I had found, but it seems that I may have been deluding myself. I hope I’m wrong, but believing someone loves you and then finding out you were wrong - is one of the most painful feelings. I don’t know if I can handle that. It Turns our there is an important difference is one’s willingness to put love, connection, and relationship above being “right” and I would happily choose our relationship, being together, being happy, and being in love over whatever the arbitrary idea of being “right” is. Unfortunately, it doesn’t not seem that my husband does not feel the same. 

There really isn’t much of a question anymore. I guess. Again, I had a much more eloquent statement earlier. But alas, finding out that you are alone and the person that you thought was your person- is not only not your person, but actively does not love you anymore - ouch, that is pretty devastating. 

Unspoken expectations always lead to resentments!
