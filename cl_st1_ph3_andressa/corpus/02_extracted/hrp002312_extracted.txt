I wrote this during a difficult time and decided to share it. Maybe someone else feels this way, or maybe someone knows how to survive a period like this.


my heart wants some rest

a warm hug from somebody who cares

a gentle hand ready to wipe my tears

a place where something was made for me

people who would know me and love me just like this

a home where my only job is to be

I have nowhere to go

no mum to call for advice

no dad who would teach me something kind

I am my own home

but sometimes it’s not enough

I am called mature, responsible

but there is no one I can call

no one who shares my blood

who was there for long

sometimes I remember how alone I am

just me, myself, and I

to shout, cry, and laugh

most of the time that’s okay

but on holidays it hurts like hell

on a random Tuesday I let myself fall

knowing I am the only one

to make this alright

I am lonely, you know

by the end of the day

family is what counts

so then

who am I
