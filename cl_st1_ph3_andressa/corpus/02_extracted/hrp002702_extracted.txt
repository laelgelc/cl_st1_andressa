So I'm a Capricorn not that it matters but ya know, as I get older I've come to understand that being a loner wasn't something I just wanted to be. Its something that was within me and its how I dealt with the cards of life. I dont mind it being at a place of contentment which feels pretty good. Not everyone has our best interests at heart and with all these fly by night people that are in and out, something about it becomes beautiful. I can stop to smell the roses and I'm happy because I'm living my truth. Just my two cents guys .  Feel free to comment and share your experiences or sum shit
