I (43M, gay) am coming out late in life. I never tried a heterosexual relationship either because I didn’t feel it was fair to her if I wasn’t 100% all in for her. I’m on a health journey to lose weight as I’m currently very overweight. I don’t feel like I’m ever going to find a guy where there is mutual attraction.
