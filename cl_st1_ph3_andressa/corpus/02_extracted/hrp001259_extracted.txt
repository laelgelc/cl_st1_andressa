Idk guys I've had been in depression 2 years ago and now I'm starting to feel the same things... Loneliness, overthinking, anxiety, stress eating, emptiness and jus some weird feelings...

Idk what it is... Idk what to do about it... Today I was jus feeling like I'm done with my life and there's no point living further :(
