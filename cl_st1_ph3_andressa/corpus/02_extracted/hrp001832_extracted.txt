First day of college. As I was searching for a seat in the crowded classroom, I saw her. The most beautiful girl I had ever been blessed to cast my eyes upon. Her hair, a waterfall of black enchantment falling down her shoulders. Her smile, a blossoming flower that would make Aphrodite envious. Her eyes, portals to the dimension of perfection.  
She was sitting in the first row, talking to a group of other girls, probably trying to make new friends.  
I stood there, mesmerised by what I could only imagine was the daughter of angels. I knew I had to talk to her. So I did. We made small talk. Then I asked her on a date.  
Two years later, I asked her to marry me.  
She said "no" both times.
