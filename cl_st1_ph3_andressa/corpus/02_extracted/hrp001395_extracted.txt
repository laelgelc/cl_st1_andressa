It is Saturday night. I just got home from work. Going to make a banana split and maybe some chicken. I feel so tired. This new meds my doctor put me on make me so sleepy. Which is good in a way. I have been getting about 10 hours of sleep every night.  But also feel like my body aches a bit. Anyway i am alone. Like i said in a previous post i no longer get lonely but would be nice to have someone. Are you guys doing any big plans for tonight?
