I've been feeling increasingly much more of a burden each time I utter a word to anyone else (I'm being visible only for brief periods of time, if I get a meltdown, otherwise I don't exist socially at all)

There's a wisdom to it that if you fall out of your own life once, you'll be unable to get it back

If you're a misfit, disabled, or a minority, you hold no value in the societal context and you're a net negative (that's why, soon or later, you're suddenly left or subliminally avoided)

That's your fate to get left behind (when others are too far ahead, there's no need for them to turn their heads around and see if you're still able to catch up)

At first, you're alone, then lonesome, reclusive and estranged, to finally get desolated and incapable of connection at all :(
