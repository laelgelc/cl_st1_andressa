I've come to realize that as a woman at this age, I will probably never have a close friendship with another girl. I'm only 19 but the amount of times I've realized my friends never text me but constantly text their boyfriends is just so fucking annoying. Or the amount of times friends have ditched me on hangouts to get dick. Like? I've known you for like 3 years but yeah stop hanging out with me for a cock you just met.

It pisses me off so bad. I'm realizing if its this bad in college, what is it gonna be like when they're married? I will be more lonely than I already am. Having a partner is a need at this point
