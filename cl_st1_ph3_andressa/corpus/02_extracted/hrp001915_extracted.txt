I’m really confused about whether I actually like him or if I’m just lonely. He’s been my friend for a long time and told me he liked me for 3–4 years. When he confessed 6–7 months ago, I felt weird and ghosted him. Three months ago we started talking again, and since then we’ve been talking every day. I began feeling attached and heard, but at the same time I felt really icky, which annoyed me and made me feel sick of myself.
I recently learned about fearful-avoidant attachment, but I don’t know if that’s what I have. Two days ago, I stopped talking to him because I felt suffocated. I told him I wouldn’t change and that I’d never like him, even though I don’t actually know how I feel. He wrote me a long message about how much he likes me without pressuring me, and I cried a lot and couldn’t sleep. I wanted everything to stop, but I’m scared the icky and suffocating feelings will keep coming back.
Now I miss him. I’ve written a long text but don’t know whether to send it. I can’t stop thinking, I feel very guilty, and this hurt won’t go away. I want to work on these feelings but don’t know where to start. I’m also very lonely and isolated, so I keep wondering if I miss him or if I’m just lonely.
