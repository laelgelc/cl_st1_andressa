For a while now I've been going to coffee shops and diners and such, by myself and eating alone. That pattern changed yesterday as I was biking through town thinking about where to eat.

This thought kept going through my head, "don't spend money on something that could have been a date."  I just kept riding and thinking it over, trying to come up with some sort of plan or ruleset, until I eventually got tired and rode home.  

This morning I went to a local market and I guess the new rule stuck, normally I'd get a coffee to sip as I browsed but today I told the barista, "maybe later" and went about looking at the crafts and knick knacks without a beverage.

Now I'm back home and thinking about a plan again. I'll still go to locations with "third space" potential, I'll browse or hang out and if I happen to strike up a conversation with somebody I'll ask if they'd like to get a drink or meal. Since I won't be eating out as much I'm going to try to incorporate these third space visits into my trips to the grocery store too, even if it's just sitting on a park bench for a few minutes before shopping.

Would you feel weird sitting in a coffee shop without ordering anything? Without having a coffee or sandwich to finish how long would you stay?
