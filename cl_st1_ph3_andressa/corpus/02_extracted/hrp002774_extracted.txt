\- Walking Free -

*I make my own way,so no one can force me to leave.*

*I play by my own rules,so I can bend them when I need.*

*I walk my own path,so I can go where I please.*

*I see things through my own eyes,so no one can make me believe.*

*I carry my own weight,so no one can hang anything on me.*

*Even though, I'm afraid,it's not always what it's cracked up to be.*

*But I know no better way,than the way of walking free.*

*-Lone Walker-*

Never doubt the lone path, or the silent mind.

What can small talk bring but small things?Why would those of bigger minds bother?

When the bucket you are in is full of water and you are oil, you can not mix with it.

This doesn't mean you're wrong to be oil, or that you can't burn brighter.

Your just in the wrong bucket.

Or a flame on the water.

The choice is yours.

What is the purpose of doubt when one has no self worth?

The purpose of fear when life has no meaning?

If you know you will fail, why not try?You already know the outcome, so what do you fear?

Since you know it, you can prepare so it does not hurt you.

In this way you will succeed.
