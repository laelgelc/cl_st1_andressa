I don’t know what’s happened to me, but In the past couple years i have become unable to manage and maintain friendships. I don’t even know the first step to texting someone and keeping in touch anymore. the past 2 years i haven’t really made a single new friend that became anything more to me than a face i see here and there. No one reaches out to me, and im pretty sure thats my fault. i think i push people away without consciously knowing it? Somehow i have managed to keep my girlfriend for a while now, and im so grateful that i have her. If i didn’t i don’t know what id do, I literally have no one else. not a single person. My home life isn’t an escape either because my family is always miserable and gets angry at me. I feel like i could disappear pretty easily. I freak out when i try to get close to people because i worry i will say something wrong or I’ll get misread, but that makes people not like me anyways.  I don’t really know if im asking for advice I just needed to get this off my chest.
