Fuck, I was never supposed to make it past 20, now I'm fucking 23. I don't know what the fuck I need to do with my life.

I just want friends and a girlfriend and shit, but I'm too fucked in the head and insecure to actually have people in my life.

I can't see myself in 5 years; the only vision I see of myself is just not existing in 5 years.

I've literally never had any grand goals in life. I wasn't supposed to fucking live past fucking high school. Now I'm just living day by day, aimlessly existing, and it doesn't feel good cause nothing has fucking changed.
