I feel very lonely and isolated, and I don’t like that I have no friends or social life. I don’t meet people naturally, and I don’t understand how others seem to form friendships or relationships so easily. I want companionship, but I don’t see clear or realistic ways to meet anyone, and that makes me feel frustrated and stuck. I feel desperately lonely right now. I don't see how things can get better for me. My life sucks and no one cares.
