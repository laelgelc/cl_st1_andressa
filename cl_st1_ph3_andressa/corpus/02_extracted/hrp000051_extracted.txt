life situation has been dragging me downward into a dark depression for some time now.  i try and try to find my way out of it but nothing i do is working.   ive been going to therapy and ive been taking the meds but the situation causing the worst of my problems is still there and im out of ideas how to fix it.   
 ive even started asking strangers on reddit for help like this.  (the posts only got a few comments or none at all)  im down to the last few scrapes of hope on the bottom of the jar, like an empty jar pf peanut butter.

i dont think im suicidal, or maybe i am, it's just that every morning i wake up for i dont even remember how long now my first thought has been "so im still here i guess, too bad, i get to keep dealing with it."

i dont even know what im asking for here.  all i know is i woke up again, so i have to keep dealing with the situation for another day.  and i dont want to anymore.
