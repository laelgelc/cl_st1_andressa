Not Reddit or YouTube. I’m creating a list of movies to watch and that’s it!

I don’t have any other social media (thank god) but I’m deleting YouTube and Reddit Friday night and I’ll download YouTube back Sunday, and maybe Reddit Monday because I’ll just be on here doom scrolling in sadness. 

But I get to babysit my 5 year old nephew and I promised him cake and candy. At the very least I have that to look forward to.
