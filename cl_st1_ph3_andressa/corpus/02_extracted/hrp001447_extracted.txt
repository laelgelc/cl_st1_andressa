I don’t feel like I’m accepted of “fit in” anywhere- not even in my family. I spend my time completely isolated. It’s not like I haven’t tried but usually trying makes things 100% worse- so I’ve stopped for the better. 

Anyone else feel like they don’t belong anywhere at all- like they were meant to be completely solitary even if they don’t really want to?
