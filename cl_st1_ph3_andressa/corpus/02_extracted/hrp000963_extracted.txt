And now im an adult that needs so much more help. Its not fair to that kid, who spent his years combating depression and the onslaught of daily suicidal thoughts. No it wasnt the bullying, but that didnt help, no it was an understanding from the begining. That loneliness had taken up permanant residence in my life... How did the adults around me not see this? Or they did and didnt care. It makes me so mad, that kid needed help , he needed real honest friends, he needed to be told that it was okay that he was unbalanced , that fear and anxiety shouldnt control his life, that there was help for what he was feeling.

Instead i learned all of that far too late. And now im an adult and im alone, And i just want help.
The fucking irony.
