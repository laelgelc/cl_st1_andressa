The second people find out you have no friends and no partner, they'll avoid you like the plague.

They'll assume there's something deeply wrong with you for you to have ended like that, and before you know it, you're even more alone. 

That's why you can never be completely who you are. You need to create a persona, pretend you have a life, and do the bare minimum to avoid drawing attention.

You'll never make friends without performing an act, because your real self is an instant turn-off for anyone. Any interpersonal foundation you might build needs to be based on a lie.
