I am a seventeen year old without many real life friends, if any. I do have quite a bit of online friends I think and I very much enjoy meeting others online. It seems easier for me to relate to people through a screen than real life. In real life, I feel constantly ignored or pushed to the side. I have even been made fun of before. I hope to meet more friends here :)
