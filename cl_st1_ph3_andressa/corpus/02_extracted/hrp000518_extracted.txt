Long story short there is a relationship that through no fault of any particular party is not going how I want it to and it’s frustrating. In that happening I’ve realized I don’t have anyone that I can talk to about it. I have friends that I guess I could but I’ve been realizing recently that we have entirely different values and also the friends that come to mind have very low emotional intelligence and are not capable of having that conversation in a helpful way. I feel like I’m not asking for a lot but apparently an ear that doesn’t come with the same relationship advice that I’ve been hearing for years is very difficult to find.
