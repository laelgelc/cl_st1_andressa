I don't know how to explain but every winter usually from late December to January, I get extra lonely feelings, I think I'm an introvert but I also carve social attention. I don't have much social battery as I tend to get tired more quickly socializing than others but I also want to be center of attention of the time. If I compare to myself from summer, my lifestyle is the same but i feel more alone during winter even tho there are others in the home with me, I still feel this.

  
I want to go to the gym but at same time this cold makes me not want to go out of the blankets, I know I should start studying for this semester but I can't physically seems to get up and start it. I'm even burnt out from using Instagram from time to time now.

  
Most importantly this feeling of being alone is making my heart very heavy, this happens every winter for the past 4-5 years. Idk what to do, do you also feel this seasonal loneliness?
