My grandpa will die this week, and I have a brain cyst. My mom and sisters cry on their husband's shoulder, and I sit in my house alone. 
I've learned all this in the past month. My mother and sisters have lots of support, husband's, friends, their animals. I'm in my house alone and crying, with no one or nothing to comfort me. An empty, seemingly cold house that feels echoy when I'm sad. I function normally through the day, but I am always sad, always down, always melancholy. I feel like I will die alone, and sometimes I welcome it.
