I made an app called Moodie because I was sick of how lonely "social" media actually makes us feel. No profiles, no filters just matching based on how you feel right now.

We’re hosting a Live Connection Event this weekend (Sat/Sun at 10 PM) so no one has to wait for a match.

Bonus: If you bring 3 friends who need a safe space, I’ll give you all free access to my mindfulness productivity, DoMind, to help with the anxiety. Let’s support each other.
