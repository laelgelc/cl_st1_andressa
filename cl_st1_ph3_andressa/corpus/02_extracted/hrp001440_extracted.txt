I try to help make people feel included as I know how hard it is to feel rejected especially as I’ve had it happen before and it guts me. But I can’t help but feel people don’t always include me at times. I try my best to work with people and connect to them but it just feels like people don’t really seem interested in me. 

Idk. Just hurts.
