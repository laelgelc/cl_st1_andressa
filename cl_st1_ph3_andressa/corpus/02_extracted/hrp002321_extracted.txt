I’m a very social and outgoing person and I interact often with a lot of people. I’m in multiple clubs, with a mentor/leadership role in one of them. In my 20s I had a lot of friends, but during covid they all moved out of state and now we’re very distant. Maybe text a meme every few months level of contact now. I got out of a three year relationship in 2024, she got tired of dealing with me. I know she loved me but by the end I know she didn’t like me very much. It’s a pattern that’s repeated my whole life. I’m always too much to deal with long term and I don’t know how not to be. 

I have depression and ADHD, medicated for both, and work very hard to manage them. I’m generally a pretty functional and reliable adult. 

I don’t really know how to deal with this anymore. I’m so lonely, but I’m scared to get close to people because I know I can find people to love me but they’ll eventually realize I’m just not very likable. Having surface-level friendly acquaintances is better than being fully alone, but it also hurts so much. 

Feel like kind of a bitch to be complaining about that here, but even with people around I’m feeling really untethered and so alone.
