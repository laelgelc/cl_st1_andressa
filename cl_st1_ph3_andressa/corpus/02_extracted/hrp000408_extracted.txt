I met this girl on discord through a mutual friend and we ended up spending lots of time on discord in a group. So all of us in the group met up in person to have a get together. She was dating someone at the time but this was a few years ago and shes had a few boyfriends since then. Well lately we've been talking alot more and seemed to be clicking on a different level. Even some of the people in the group have been giving us crap about dating.

 For reference shes 27 and im 31 and we had talked about doing a group meet up this year. So I texted her yesterday saying that id like to come visit as it been awhile since ive been there and that maybe we could do something for our birthdays as they are 2 weeks apart. She hearted that text and asked if it was the group meet up.
So replied back that we could the group thing then and asked about doing something earlier just the 2 of us. 

Haven't heard anything back as I asked at like 3pm and now its 3am. She sent me something on Instagram messenger an hour after I sent her the text.

Thing that gets me is that she told a friend on new years eve when she was drunk that if I lived in the same town she'd date me. We live in different states so I get thats a challenge. She also called me on new years eve and said she loved me. 

Im probably cooked but I figured I gotta know since ive been crushing on her since I met her.
