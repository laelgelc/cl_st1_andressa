Are you a bank?
I’m ready to invest my time.
Not my hours, but my years.
I want to bury them deep inside you
where the light doesn’t reach.


Are you a bank?
I can see the profit in your eyes
all that untapped life,
just waiting for someone to withdraw it.
Would you give me some of the interest too,
or would only you benefit?


Are you a bank?
Because the world outside is screaming,
and I trust no one.
I need a vault.
I need thick walls and no windows.
I need somewhere to hide myself inside you.


Are you a bank?
If I lose everything,
would you open your vault
just to kick me out?
Or would you hide my existence
from others to keep me safe?


Are you a bank?
Because I heard the vaults are safe.
I heard it was secure.


Are you a bank?
I thought so.
Are you...
Are you open?
Because I am hurt.
Because I am vulnerable.


Why are you open?

Who did you let out before me?

Why should I trust you?

Can I even enter?

Or would you close

before I get inside?


Is the inside of your walls red?
Or is everything I bring in
eventually marked,
counted,
and locked away
until even you
forget
I was ever stored there…
