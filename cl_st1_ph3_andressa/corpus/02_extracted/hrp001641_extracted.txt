I'm Max, and I'm 27. I've felt lonely for most of my life, often without even realizing it. This led me to start researching loneliness and how it affects us.

I'm looking to speak with people about their experiences of loneliness. Your insights would be super helpful for my research. If you're up for a casual interview about how loneliness affects you and any thoughts you have on the subject, I'd love to hear from you.

It would take about 15-20 minutes over Zoom. No video, just voice.

Everything you share will stay anonymous, and our conversation will be relaxed and informal. If you're interested or have any questions, just shoot me a message.

Thanks for considering it, and I hope to talk to someone of you here! Just drop a comment here or dm me.
