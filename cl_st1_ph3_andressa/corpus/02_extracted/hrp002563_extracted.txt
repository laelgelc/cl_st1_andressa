I’m 60(M?). I finally admitted to myself that I am transgender about 8 months ago, but I think I’ve known I’ve been transfem for more than 10 years. I have wanted to be a woman for that long anyway. 

I grew up in a strict Catholic family and have recently finished a 44 year career in the Army - hyper masculine profession if there ever was one.

I have been married for 30 years and we have 3 sons in their late 20s. There is no way that my wife would accept that I’m trans and she has significant physical and mental health issues. Two of my sons might accept the real me, if she were to surface. My mother and probably all of my five siblings would not accept me either. I think, however, that almost all of my 11 nieces and nephews would accept me. Minimum one who happens to be transmasc.

Not sure if my assessment that no one would be  accepting of the real me, is me projecting, but I think I’ve thought about it long enough to be pretty much right.

I’m not sure that I will ever be able to come out and be my authentic self. Ever.

What’s holding me back? Mostly it’s my wife’s medical condition. If she divorced me, or worse, I would forsake the acceptance of my friends and family, in a nanosecond, to be me.

But I am pretty much resigned to never being able to be myself, to continue to fake this persona that everyone else knows and likes, for the rest of my life. 

And in doing so, I am  committing to be utterly alone for whatever length of time I have left in my life, because the real me will never speak to anyone, interact with anyone, or even touch anyone.

The real me is destined to live inside me for eternity. 

I’m not sure that there is anything else I can do, other than grin and bear it. 

All that I guess l can hope from writing this, is that in some minuscule way, it will help to alleviate some of the loneliness I feel to the very centre of my being, every day. But probably not!

Thanks for reading this to here. I hope you have a great week!
