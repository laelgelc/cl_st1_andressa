I wouldn't say I'm a total hermit because I live in my parents house and not outside and I'm not doing it for religious reasons, but I've been a recluse for years ever since 2012 (but I'm on social security disability so I get money). So I'm a half hermit. I only get out of the house when I have to.

It's crazy how everyone became an isolated unemployed loner like me now due to the coronavirus. Maybe we can have some empathy.

Also in a nutshell for why I was isolated for that long staying in the house unemployed and getting out when I have to or for walks: Mental illness and misanthropy.

I'm 24.

When the virus blows over though and people go back to their normal extroverted ways I will lack that empathy so it's once in a lifetime I get to actually feel something for other people again.

I don't want to be too bleak with this.

It's crazy because I was going to try therapy for the millionth time to maybe get some help on my unstable relationships with people as I'm verbally aggressive with people but the virus messed up my schedule to progress in my life. I'm not really socially anxious or anything, it seems getting into verbal fights with people thus leading to isolation is rare, but again, I don't wanna get too deep with this.
