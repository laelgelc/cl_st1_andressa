Hi everyone, I’m 20F and looking for a genuine platonic friendship with a guy around my age. (18-24)

I have close female friendships already and value them. Lately though I’ve been interested in building a solid male friendship as well. I enjoy conversations that develop naturally over time and I prefer friendships that start without any pressure or obligations.

I can be witty and sarcastic, and I enjoy playful banter. My interests include cats, birds, fashion, music, books, writing, and games.

I play games like Roblox, VRChat, Minecraft, and Skyrim. I enjoy voice and video calls once we're comfortable. I am American and I'm mentioning it for context.

I greatly appreciate consistency, loyalty, and mutual respect. I can communicate directly and also appreciate clear communication from others. I’m very comfortable giving space when needed.

If you’re looking for a low-pressure friendship built on shared interests and conversation, feel free to reach out.
