 It seems I always get ghosted or put in friend zone. And the ones who say they are into end up in 4 categories:  1 fake 2 scammers 3 needing a hand out 4 not the type I’m looking for.  I know my worth and will not settle for peace.  Then there are the ones who ridicule and talk bunch of disrespect because a true man comes admitting how broken he is and only wants someone to love him as much as he would love him the best of his ability.  Not looking for a hand or a womans money he has his own plus mortgage free home. Retired trying to live his best life but rather it with someone who is not shallow.
