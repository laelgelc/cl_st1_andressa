Hey guys,

Towards the end of 2025 I was feeling lonely and without purpose despite having people around me, I often felt like I couldn't say my genuine thoughts because I had to be what people expected of me - especially for me, growing up in an environment with other men who don't talk much about their feelings so they can show they are tough, I never had any male role models I could look up to who displayed vulnerability - the only source I got from this was online & ironically that ain't always good.

These feelings I've had for years, I wanted to have a purpose where I could display a vulnerable side of me that I've never really expressed. I used this to build an app called BeHuman, where you send & receive one message from a stranger each day and can get your thoughts off your mind & feel small but genuine daily connection. You can be as anonymous as you like - I actually found I like sharing more about myself to a stranger than a friend because a stranger doesn't have the expectations of me that have been created by those around me in real life. It feels like a daily mindfulness practice to me and I hope other can resonate with this too.

I've received some really beautiful messages from strangers already, I wholeheartedly just believe this is now my purpose and I've never felt more free expressing myself through this creation, I hope those who use it can benefit similarly.
