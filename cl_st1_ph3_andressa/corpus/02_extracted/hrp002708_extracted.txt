I have always been a loner. I enjoy my own company. And the company of my significant other, mostly. Lol. Everytime i try to hang around with a “friend” i just want it to be over and i feel like im forcing it. And thinking of things to say. Worrying of oversharing. Then panicking after im home about what did or didnt happen. 

I feel like i SHOULD have friends but i dont need them. Im quite alright with just people who are just acquaintances. Nothing more, nothing less. 

I worry one day when i get married, i will have no bridesmaids. Not alot of guests. I just recently had a baby shower and it was a few family members and my boyfriends family kept saying “invite as many friends as you want!” And i had nobody i really felt was close enough to be there. I feel guilty and i feel embarrassed sometimes. 

I also just wonder if people with “friends” are always just faking it and have energy to do so.  Really just typing to get some of this off my chest. Being quarantined has a way of allowing you to over analyze.
