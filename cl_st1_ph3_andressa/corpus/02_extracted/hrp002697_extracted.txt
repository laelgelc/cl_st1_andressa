To be honest I have a hard time finding a definitive definition for an Underdog because I saw difference answers online, but one of which was that a Underdog is more of an guy doing his stuff alone rather than in a group, which sounds to a degree like an loner to me. Though again, i'm not 100% sure what the true definition is.
