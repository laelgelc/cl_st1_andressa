I had a good time on new years but I usually feel down for a few days after drinking. I can easily go without drinking so im going to do that for a bit. 

I met this woman a few years ago trough a friend on discord and we've met in person before. Lately we started talking alot more now that she broke up with her boyfriend. Ive had a crush on her when I 1st met so its been nice to see her while we chat. We'll the past few weeks shes said she loves me and called me on NYE and said it. Not sure if she means it in a friendly way or not but I feel like its sincere. 

She just gets shut in sometimes and doesnt talk alot so we've only talked a little the past few days.
Just trying to figure out what to do. I kinda feel like a loser being 31 and posting this but I just need some advice. She's 26 so not crazy younger than me. I think ive just been alone too long and Im a pretty social person so it just kinda sucks being alone.
