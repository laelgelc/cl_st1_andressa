Where shall I start, ever wondered what if I was not married or if I was not in line of work or if I have not taken that decision? Everyone says never say no to good things coming your way either work or relationship or anything else. If it will not work at least you tired?

But what if you have waited for longer or not jumped into it and something else would happened maybe good or maybe not so good.

I am feeling the same way have I jumped into something the first time came my way. Was it a mistake or a tide will pass and everything will be okay.

Not sure where I stand now but feeling hollow and not sure why I am not content in what I have.
