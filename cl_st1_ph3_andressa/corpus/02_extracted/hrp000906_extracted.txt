So for these next 3 days ago my father took my step mother for their anniversary and honestly I am just so much more lonely than usual. I want a girlfriend and keep trying to get one but online dating just keeps draining my mental state. Then finally almost nobody has really talked to me much today. Which has all combined together to make today more trying than somedays. I hope someday soon I’ll find a girlfriend or something but today is just making it feel impossible. Thanks for reading this. This was just a bit of a vent
