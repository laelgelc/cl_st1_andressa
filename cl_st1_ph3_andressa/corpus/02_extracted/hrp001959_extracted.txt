Ugh I have such bad anxiety and isolate myself easily from people so i dont have many friends now. Most days that's okay and ive come to terms with it, i hang out with my brother and hes cool. I also do love spending time on my own in my room and I have one best friend, but we dont see each other much and our online communication is only down to sending reels back and forth lol.
 She just very busy at the moment moving out.

Anyway recently an old online hookup texted me again and he makes me so fucking giddy and just giggly and then i realised how back in high-school when I had that feeling of getting a crush on a guy, i had actual FRIENDS that i could tell about it and gossip and giggle with. But now i dont have anyone.

Or even like meaningless  influencers on tik tok drama. Sometimes  its funny and entertaining  to keep up with and I tell my brother sometimes but he doesnt get it. Ahhhh i just wish I had a girlfriend to talk to about these things idk!
but nobody understands anxiety and going quiet for a few days isnt normal idk man.
