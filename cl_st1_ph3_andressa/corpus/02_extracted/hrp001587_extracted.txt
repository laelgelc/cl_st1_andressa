Modern revelation in little life we live and vastness we've been gone to.

You don't ought to be the person they wanted as a person to being cared about. You owe yourself more than they claim what you built. Erase the significance which comes from terms and conditions. And replace it with your own privilege no one dared to give. Your anger demands freedom. They took too much from you but your spirit belongs with you.

You are always with yourself since you were born. Now go live with yourself and fight for your sole pride.
