There's this person that I've only recently liked but I've kinda been slight friends with them, they've been in my classes for about 3 years. All summer I've contemplated talking to them bit lack the confidence to ask, as every past attempt to get a someone I've fallen flat. I always think I'm to unorthodox and weird looking.
