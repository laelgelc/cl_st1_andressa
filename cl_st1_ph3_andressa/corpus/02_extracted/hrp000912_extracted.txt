Hello. I (M19) am beginning my second year of college tomorrow. I’ve been a very isolated person my whole life. I never had siblings, I didn’t have a single friend until 6th grade (that friendship just ended), I never had close relationships with any family member, and my job is seasonal, so I don’t see the co workers there beyond a few months a year. Last year (my first year of college) I was in a horrible social situation that was harmful and dangerous for me. I now am going into my second year of university entirely alone. My question is, how do I “put myself out there”? Or make friends? I’ve asked this question a lot, so here are some things I’ve already tried/things to consider.

1. I’ve tried joining clubs, but not only does my school have very few clubs, but all I joined are disbanded. I look at the club list everyday, and I haven’t seen anything I can really join. I can’t make my own until I have 15 people to sign up, and I’m not there yet.
2. My school doesn’t have much of a party scene. We’re next to a huge university, so everyone just goes there. I don’t drink or anything so I avoid parties. Plus I don’t know where or when they are. 
3. My school is almost entirely female. 80% of the student body is female, 90% of my school is female, and the few males there are on campus I have basically nothing in common with. I’m totally cool having girl (space) friends, but I am also terrified as coming across as a creep or romantically interested when I’m not. 

It seems like I’m really out of options here for finding friends and the loneliness has been crushing. I’m not perfect. I can’t be bad at small talk, and I can definitely self sabotage, but I really want to make an effort to find friends. I just need one, a small group, or something. Any help and advice is appreciated!
