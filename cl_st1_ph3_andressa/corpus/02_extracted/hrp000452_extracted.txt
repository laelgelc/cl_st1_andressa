For a long time, I was perfectly happy with being alone but now I find when I meet people like we could have one good conversation or just become friends and I’m an imagining all these scenarios of us, we’re gonna go here and do this but that’s not always the way things go and my brain can’t seem to accept this and then when this friendship or possible relationship doesn’t make these expectations. I just lose my mind. When I get any glimpse at hope of a possible relationship or friendship it just seems that I build up all these hopes and nothing comes out of it and it’s tearing me apart and I don’t know how to stop it.
