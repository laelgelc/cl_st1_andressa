i am 16  years old i eat healthy i play sports i study well but i feel empty inside i never had a girlfriend in my life i never talked to a girl i was being bullied at school because of my look because of that my social anxiety increased i isolated myself from people to protect my mental health and protect myself from judging and bullying i never had someone who understands me someone who really care my parents love me and i love them too but they are not emotionally connected to me i never had that deep conversation with them i have friends and i hang out with them but i cant tell them about my loneliness because they dont care that much i always play video games for a very long hours to escape this emptiness  in conclusion i just want a hug someone who cares someone who understands me
