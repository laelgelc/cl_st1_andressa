I only exist to go to work and college. 

I don’t have anything to look forward to. 

I never have weekend plans. 

I don’t even have anyone I can call. 

Every single person I wanted to be friends with ignored me/treated me like a joke. 

Even my own family ignores me or they text me back the most dry/I can’t be bothered respond.
