I lost two really important relationships recently. One someone who became a best friend and the other was my partner. I’ve been through a lot in the last 10 years. A lot of it is the result of unresolved trauma and now finally at 41 I’m dealing with it. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist and I know I’m making the right decision and prioritizing my mental health. But I’m so incredibly lonely. So unbelievably lonely. I’ve made a few posts on here seeking out friendship and healthy relationships and it’s been hit and miss on people responding. Recently I met someone on here and by all definitions she’s incredibly cool and I admire her. And amidst my loneliness I’m struggling to maintain friendships. I don’t want to be lonely and yet I just keep isolating. I don’t want to be lonely but it’s like I just also don’t want to reach out to people or it’s like I forget to check in on them and then realize it’s been days. Even as I write this I feel so pathetic for struggling with loneliness and also struggling to reach out to people or feeling like I know how to engage with people. I keep trying to go out and do things just to get out and be amongst people and I just get sad and feel worse. My mental health has been so bad at times that nothing feels worthwhile and I this is only making things feel worse. I just feel like I’m in a cycle of flushing myself down a toilet and I keep trying to reach out for help only to keep pulling the handle.
