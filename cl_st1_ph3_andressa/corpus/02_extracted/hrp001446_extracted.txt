I was lonely for a while no boyfriend and only a small handle of ‘true’ friends, I used to think that was loneliness, I was not wrong of course it was. Loneliness is a feeling a feeling we have no control over, a feeling we can’t escape from. And I would always wonder if it would change, I felt like I needed a boyfriend to fill that void, to make me not feel so alone, to let me feel loved, needed and wanted.. all of which are psychological basic human needs. 
Then I lost my mum it’s been 9 months since she’s gone and now I know what it feels like to be really lonely. There a hole in my heart that left me, that can’t be replaced. People say I’m strong, or that it’ll get beer with time. But I wasn’t prepared for this level of loneliness, I can’t explain the feeling, it’s just this emptiness inside me. When she died I honestly feel like I lost a part of me too a part of me left with her, to be with her. But that part of me left being  feeling of emptiness, a slightly bitter emotional detachment from people, from the world, from myself. 

I guess I wasn’t ready for the this kind of loneliness. I just hope it ends there and doesn’t get any lower than that. I don’t think my heart could take it anymore. I genuinely don’t. 

Just needed a sounding board. Thankyou you sub Reddit for fulfilling that need. Please don’t inbox me redditors, I’m ok, a little bit lost. But it’s journey I need to take alone. To fix me.
