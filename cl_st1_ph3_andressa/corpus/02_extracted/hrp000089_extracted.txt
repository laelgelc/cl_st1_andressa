Even social media is really tiring nowadays. A lot of Dunning-Kruger Effect showcases, people making dumb takes but with sky-high confidence; People who make a problem out of everything, or in the opposite spectrum, people who handwave very real problems; vocal toxic minority given space and opportunity to spew their vitriol online; etc. etc.

How am I supposed to satisfy my psychological need of connection when social media is so toxic and tiring that it makes me want to isolate myself?
