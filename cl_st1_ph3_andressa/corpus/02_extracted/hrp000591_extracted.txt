I’m a college student, female. I have never been very good at making friends. By that I mean, I’ve always had companions, but never friends. In elementary school, I was outcast. I was only invited to birthday parties of kids whose mothers knew my mom- so it was more of an obligation for them to invite me. In middle school, I was never invited to a Bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah. I moved states as well for middle school so it became even harder to make friends cuz everyone already had their cliques. In high school, I had a couple “friends” in the sport and clubs I did but again, they were more companions than friends. We only ever met or talked when we had practice or meetings, and never outside of it. For prom, my prom group had planned to go out and explore the city together. I had explicitly told them that I couldn’t make it on Sunday, but no one else could do any other days so they all went on Sunday except me. Now, in college as well, I haven’t been able to make many friends. My roommates all have people here they are closer to than they are to me, but I have no one like that. I’ve tried everything: I’m in multiple student orgs, I almost never am in my dorm, and I try to talk to everyone I meet, but they always just forget me and stick to the group they already have.

Also, I’ve never had anyone ever express romantic interest in me, nor have I really ever had a crush on anyone. I think I’m aromantic but that’s for another Reddit page. But, it still stings to think that I would never have anyone who likes me like the romcoms. I’ve never dated, never had my first kiss, never even held hands romantically with anyone and it doesn’t really seem like it’s changing anytime soon.

I’m also an only child. So when my parents die, it’s just going to be me. And I’m scared about that. Any advice?
