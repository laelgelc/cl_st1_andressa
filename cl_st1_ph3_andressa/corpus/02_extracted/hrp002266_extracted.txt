23M from Bangalore, currently working as a software developer.

An introvert at first, but once the conversation flows, it really flows , Looking to make friends around my age and see where things go.

If you enjoy meaningful conversations and hate ghosting, we’ll get along just fine — I’m the kind of person who sticks around once we vibe.

Feel free to slide into my DMs.

And yes, the account is new — deleted my 4-year-old account just to take a break. So please don’t judge by the number of days here.
