since 1 week i was feeling a bit better because i thought that maybe it's not all that bad and in work other's would talk to me more but now i realize that its all fake anyway and that everybody hates me. I can't live with the feeling of being judged and stuff. I wish nobody would talk to me but i dont wanna be an asshole. Should i just say to other's even my closer partners that i dont wanna talk to them and that i wanna be alone or is that selfish? They always judge me for being alone
