i have lived most of my life surrounded with friends 24*7. i thought thats normal. now reached 39. i dont recall getting any calls from anyone or messages from anyone. i just feel so terribly lonely. i wish somebody was there. just a message here and there to ask how you are doing. is that a big thing to ask. 

i dont know. but i feel so lonely.
