(27M) I only have two friends, and I see them few times a month. The problem is that they only reply to my messages the day we meet and the day after we meet. After that, they disappear and never reply to me again. I have to wait days for a response. I obviously try to reply to their messages within 24 hours, but I have to wait days or even weeks for their answers. What can I do? Every time we meet, everything is ok, we have fun, everyone is happy, but then they disappear and I feel abandoned every time.
