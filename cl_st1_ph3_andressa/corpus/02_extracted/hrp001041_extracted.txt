I don't know if this is allowed here, but I wanted to share something.

A while back I hit a point where I realized I had people in my life but no one I could actually *talk* to. Not about the real stuff. Everyone was busy, or I didn't want to be a burden, or I just couldn't find the words.

So I started building an app. It's called Blurble. The idea is simple,  you sign in anonymously and get matched with a real person who's also looking to connect. No profiles, no photos, no pressure. Just a conversation.

I'm not here to sell anything. It's not even fully built yet. But I'm collecting emails from people who want to try it when it's ready.

If this resonates with you, the site is [www.blurble.net](http://www.blurble.net). And if you just want to vent in the comments, I'm here for that too.
