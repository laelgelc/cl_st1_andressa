I moved out of my family house at 15. I turned 17 a few months ago and didn’t celebrate my birthday. I get by with around 300$ a month, all my bills are paid for by my parents, they just let me move out. 

I have never had any friends really. Not real friends and that was okay to me. I always explained it as I wasn’t a friend type of person. But I had an acquaintance with this one girl who was really nice to me. She hated all my opinions And I hated hers but somehow we could have conversations when we wanted to which would be once a week normally. But this semester of school I don’t get to see her like at all. 

Normally I would sit with her at lunch but she has a different lunch so every lunch I just sit in the bathroom by myself. 

I figured that I would be fine just like I always am but i didn’t realize how much human interaction was important for me. I normally go to youth group so that I can see people my age who aren’t really mean and I haven’t been able to go in about a month. 

The best interaction I have had in the past year was when I was driving from one city to another at night and a guy wanted to race and we just had so much fun passing each other and seeing how fast we could go. I literally hit 105 which is not bad but the speed limit was 60 😀

Idk I just feel as though I am always so tired I am nice to everyone I try so hard I even do my makeup and hair which I use to hate like I changed myself so much so that maybe maybe someone would talk to me but no no one ever talks to me and I don’t really get it the one girl who I thought would be my friend was so fake that she used me as a means to lie to her parents about going to stay with a guy she met online 

I just wish to share myself with someone
