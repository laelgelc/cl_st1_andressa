So today, my teacher told us to form a duo for an activity. I wasn’t worried at first because my seatmate was right beside me — I thought we’d automatically pair up.

But then, my heart dropped. My seatmate suddenly stood up, went to another group, and made a trio.
A trio. When it was supposed to be a duo.

I just sat there pretending to write something in my notebook while trying to calm my breathing. The room was quiet, and it felt like everyone’s eyes were on me.

My teacher even warned the trio that one of them needed to leave, or else they wouldn’t get a paper. But they didn’t care.

So, I quietly told my teacher that I’d just do the work individually.

Thankfully, another pair noticed and invited me to join them, so we became a trio in the end. Still, that moment was so embarrassing and disheartening.
