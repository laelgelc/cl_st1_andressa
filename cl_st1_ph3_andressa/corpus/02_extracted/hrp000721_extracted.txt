Hey everyone 👋

So I recently moved to Bengaluru (22M) for work and honestly this is gonna be my first Diwali away from home.
No family, no old friends here yet — and as the lights and music start everywhere, it’s hitting a little bit different 🫶

I don’t wanna spend the night scrolling reels or sitting alone — so thought why not post here and maybe connect with a few chill people who’re also in the same boat?

Would love to meet folks who’re up for:
🎆 Evening hangout / clubbing / chill café plan
🍕 Food, long drive, or just random conversations
🎶 Music, laughter, and maybe some new friendships

Not looking for anything weird — just some good company, positive vibes & maybe a small Diwali celebration together ✨

If you’re also staying back in Bengaluru and wanna make this Diwali a little less lonely, DM or comment below.
Let’s make the city feel a bit more like home ❤️
