Context, on here I already have been going by 17 for a week now to get used to it. Anywho lately I’ve been feeling pretty lonely. To the point my mom asked what I wanted for a birthday gift and I just laughed and said a girlfriend (I never ever tell her anything like that any other time) but I’m just asking maybe someone can hit me up and get to know me more. I’m not that weird, though I know I communicate better with females then I do males but anyways I’m just kinda feeling really really lonely and life lately has been a gut punch straight to the stomach so dm me. Also I don’t care what age just don’t be under 16 please.
