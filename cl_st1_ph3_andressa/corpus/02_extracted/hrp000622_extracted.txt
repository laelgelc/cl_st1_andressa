i, 19, am going through it rn. its like a part of my soul was stripped away from the endless amount of work, unnecessary and necessary stress, and i just lost my gf. now i know i sound a bit pissy about my life to the whole wide world, but i genuinely don't know how to vent this anger and isolation to any of my peers or family due to them moving on to greater endeavors while im sitting down looking at what i could've been. i also know that some people have it worse than me but i don't know if i can accept my failure and move on cause its so damn difficult. the rant that im currently writing is an extension of my escapism. so if anyone pops by to look at this, may you please share your tips on how to combat this hopeless feeling? thanks
