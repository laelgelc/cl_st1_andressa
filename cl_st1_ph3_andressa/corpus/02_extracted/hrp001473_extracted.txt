I believe I’m a great friend. I always try to care about the people around me and give 100%, even if I don’t get the same in return. I’m a woman, and my friend group has always been entirely men. Because of that, I always felt like I was somehow on the side, that I would never be anyone’s number one. Sometimes, when that realization hit me, I had moments of crying into my pillow at night, but in the end, things were still okay.
To be clear — I have no idea why I don’t have female friends. In general, forming friendships is hard for me. I’m very shy, and I was usually just “adopted” by someone. All the girls I met already had their friend groups, and it was hard for me, the outsider, to get into them. But having a close female friendship has always been my unreachable dream.
Recently, however, my friend group has been falling apart. Long story short, one of my friends accused me of something I didn’t do. I honestly don’t know what happened. He was drunk and seems to have gaslit himself into believing I said something I never said. He made a scene about it in the middle of the street, even though there were plenty of witnesses to our conversation, and EVERYONE can tell him he imagined the whole situation. The problem is that even after sobering up, he is convinced he’s right. He also started turning people who weren’t even there against me, and I can see they’ve begun acting cold towards me. The guy I considered my best friend (and who is also his best friend) hasn’t even reached out to talk to me about it. I feel strangely abandoned and I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for three weeks now. I texted this friend asking to meet and talk, but he hasn’t even opened my message. I’m trying to hold it together and not show that I’m struggling (I don’t like making my partner worry), but all I feel is growing panic. I haven’t felt this lonely and cornered in a long time — I feel like the only thing I can do is withdraw.
