Uh hi. I just need to put this somewhere: 13F

I’m so lonely and angry. I hate myself so.fucking.much.
I’ve never had any romantic interaction and everyone around me either has found their person and is married or has a girlfriend. Everyone at school has a girlfriend and they don’t even love them, they are such fucking players and they just want somebody to have control over. I don’t want that, I want my person. I want my wife. 
I remember one night back in may of this year, I had just finished watching Karla, the movie with Laura Prepon. I was scrolling on Instagram and saw a video of this lesbian couple getting engaged at a Billie concert, I was completely sent over the edge. It was 2:am and I had just had enough. I had a bottle of pills I had been prescribed for menstrual pain and thought about taking them, I came pretty damn close. The closest I’ve ever been. That was the worst night I’ve ever had.
I got better for a few months but recently it’s just come right back again and it’s so much worse, I don’t know what to do. That feeling has come back again today and it’s scary. So scary. 
I’m sorry I don’t know what to say. I feel like such an attention seeking bitch. I don’t think I am but my brain is starting to convince me I am, but there’s still a little part of me that is screaming for help. 
I can’t do it anymore I want it all to end but if I kms now I won’t ever meet my baby, and I won’t be able to marry her. 
I feel like I’m stuck in a never ending cycle. 
Im currently laying down and have a knife placed on my chest. This is me reaching out for help. I don’t want attention I just want to feel like somebody else understands this, I feel like it’s just me. I need help.
