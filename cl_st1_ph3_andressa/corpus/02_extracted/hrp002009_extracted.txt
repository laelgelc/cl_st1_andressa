Since losing my friend group because I was stupid enough to get into a relationship I really shouldn't have went into, I've been extremely isolated in my college's city. I still have my family and friends back home, who I go out with during breaks, and I am grateful for them, but I feel so bad because it's not enough. 

This entire semester has been a cycle of uni - gym - repeat. I don't go out. I don't do anything. I tried volunteering groups, but it didn't work out in the end.

What bothers me is that I'm generally well liked, or at least tolerated. But not enough so to be invited to places, and I am too insecure to invite people to stuff myself. 

I've been trying to blame it on my looks ever since it's been an issue, even before that, but it's honestly not it. Most people would say I look at least above average. Yet I can't get into a relationship for the life of mine.

Maybe it is my personality. I am totally aware. But nobody is saying anything about it, and I am too blindsided to figure it out myself. I consider myself introspective to a fault, rationalising every feeling, to at least give the impression that I understand myself.

It kinda hit me today, when I got out of an exam, and found myself with free time again, after a few weeks of studying... just to play video games alone in my dorm room. I really wish I would have somebody here to go bowling with, it was a random thought I had today ( I dont even like bowling that much ). I miss going out, just for the sake of it. I really wish people chose me, and actively desired my presence, but it sounds like a far fetched dream. 

Sorry if this isn't very coherent, but posting it somewhere feels better than just leaving it in my notes.
