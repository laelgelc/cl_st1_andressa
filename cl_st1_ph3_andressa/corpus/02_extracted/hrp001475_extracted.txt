How did we come to this...
The feeling of being alone and not being understood..
Feels like i have lost touch with communication and understanding of what people want and how to connect!!
Am i the only one who feels like this??
How do i connect with someone, how do i make Friends from my surrounding...
When we all end up avoiding people in total...
What a fucking nightmare 💯
