I've been alone for so long now that I can't pick up conversations with people. It's not that I have attempted to interact or be apart of the convos, it's more like if I'm not invited into them I won't interrupt. Sometimes it's even difficult to talk to people when I initiate the topic, but then comes in someone who feels like what they have to say is more important, so I just shut down and regain the solitude I was in pryor to it. It's mind blowing how people around a quiet person points out " you're so quiet" what they don't understand is we were once loud ( ish), we just realized our vibe isn't for everyone.
