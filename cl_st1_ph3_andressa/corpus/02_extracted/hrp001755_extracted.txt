Ladies, I’m struggling with something and I genuinely want to know if this is common outside of my circle.

I’m 26, in grad school, and most of my friends have already graduated. I’m so confused if this is just what adulthood is like. It feels like everyone is married and having kids, and you go from having so many friends to basically none overnight.

Once people get married, it feels like their spouse becomes their only priority. A lot of girls don’t seem to care to put effort into maintaining friendships once they’re taken. It’s honestly so confusing and really sad. You lose your friends in a heartbeat, and as a single girl I constantly feel anxious and alone. I feel like I have no one to talk to, and sometimes I genuinely don’t understand the point of life anymore.

I do have a few unmarried friends, but it feels like they’re just chasing a relationship and that’s all they talk about. I can already see that the friendship will end the minute they find someone, so it makes me not want to put in effort, time, or money into the friendship or future wedding events if I know it’s just going to disappear anyway.

Is this common at this age? It honestly feels like once I finish school, it’ll be even worse. Like I’ll have nothing to work toward except a 9–5 for the rest of my life.
