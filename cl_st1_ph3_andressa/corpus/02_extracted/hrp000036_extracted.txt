Hey y'all,

My name is Cambria and I'm an 18-year-old girl in my fourth year of college studying ecology & eco education. I love plants, playing videogames, shitposting, listening to music, making jewelry among other crafts, spending time with my blue heeler pup, and listening to people. I have a boyfriend and one friend but besides that I'm pretty damn alone. I would consider myself to be kind & funny, I love making people laugh, I'm ambitious and try to work hard and be positive although a slew of mental health issues do weigh on me.

I don't have a ton of time to talk due to over-full-time uni + work + my relationship which also tends to get in the way of making pals, but I just feel so alone sometimes & I don't want to get overdependent on my bf for socializing cause that's unfair to him. If anyone is down for chatting every once in a while/checking in on each other/sharing memes or interests, message me please :) I'm open to lots of messaging services but my Discord is rockisdead.mp3 #4016. Looking forward to meeting you!
