Hello,  
I know a lot of people feel lonely like I do, and even if they’re around others or busy, that feeling can still be there. I’ve felt it a lot myself, and it really affects me mentally.

One thing I’ve learned: don’t force yourself to be social. Take things slowly, and focus on one or two true friends who share the moments that make you happy they’re the ones who will fill the emptiness you feel.  
Over time, you’ll find people who truly care about you and understand you. It’s okay if they’re few, what matters is that they’re genuine.

If you have any advice or similar experiences, I’d love to hear your thoughts ❤️
