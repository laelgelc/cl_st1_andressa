I hate myself for it honestly. Like she was my soulmate and because when I should have been thinking about her I was thinking about myself and now she is gone. She was dealing with mental health stuff like suicidal thoughts and breast cancer. I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from pushing her away to be there for her. Now I'll die alone because of my stupid decision and selfishness
