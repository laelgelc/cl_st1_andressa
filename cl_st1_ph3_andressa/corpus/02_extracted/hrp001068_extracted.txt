Hello everyone,

I (m, almost 18) am asexual and aromantic. For me, this means: no desire for sexual or romantic relationships.

At the same time, I have a strong need for closeness in a non-sexual sense (e.g., talking, being together, cuddling). This is where my inner conflict arises:

I am very afraid of loneliness because many social relationships are strongly defined by romance or sexuality. At the same time, I fear that my need for closeness might overwhelm others, manipulate them, or unintentionally cross boundaries—even when I clearly communicate that it’s nothing sexual and that a “no” is always respected.

I often think about whether I “deserve” closeness, whether I’m even allowed to ask for it, or if I should suppress my need in order not to put anyone in an uncomfortable situation.
Additionally, I struggle with inner restlessness, phases of derealization, and anxiety, which makes everything even more complicated.

My questions to you:
Are there people here who feel something similar (ace/aro or in general)?
How do you deal with closeness without putting pressure on yourself or others? Is my need for physical closeness inherently problematic—or is it more about how I handle it?

I’m not looking for a substitute for therapy, but for perspectives, experiences, and honest assessments. 
I hope that I don't sound like a pervert

Thank you for reading.
