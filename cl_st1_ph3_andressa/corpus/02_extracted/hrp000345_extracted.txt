I'm still very excited about getting a snow day. I'm the boss so I get to make the call lol. But they do make it stressful and the last 72 hours preparing both work and home for this storm has been DRAINING. I've been sitting at home for about an hour after making it back home (had to go into work to close my theater) and... idk... I just feel off.

It wasn't the best morning and with the urgent nature of these situations I guess, now that I made it safely home... the fear of it all is melting off and I'm just realizing how alone I am. I checked in with everyone I felt I needed to. My boss. Family. Friends. "I'm safe!" And I think thats when I put my phone down and just... there was nothing... just me.

I am still very excited for my snowday. Tomorrow may bring a whole mess of problems. But for now I get to just watch the snow and make treats and stay cozy! 🥰

But I thought maybe this was the perfect time to post on here and maybe find some conversation and friends.

36. Male. Homo-Demi. Movie buff. Horror fan. Still have my christmas tree up lol. That's pretty much me lol.

Stay safe if anyone else is getting snowed in!
