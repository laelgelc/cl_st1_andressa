Idk if I’m exhausted, feel misunderstood or legit just lonely but I feel like it’s so hard to make genuine connections with people and part of it has led me to just go numb. Not mad not sad not stressed or frustrated anymore. Just can’t feel anything. Some days I’m okay with it cause then I don’t have to feel everything at once. But then there’s other days that I just wanna feel something cause at least I won’t feel alone or empty. I have two close friends but yet they still feel distance or like it feels almost exhausting wanting to be the support for them. And I want to expand my friend circle but at the same time it just feels that communicating or talking to some people it’s very surface. There’s a lack of depth.
