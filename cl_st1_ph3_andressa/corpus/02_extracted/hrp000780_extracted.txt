So I am in my first year of uni and one month in I did make a few friends , but one day they all just started ignoring me .

And today they just called me after uni that I shouldn't talk to them , as I am ' gonna get them in trouble' ( even though I didn't do anything I can recall as troubling but oh well) .

I said ' that's fine ' and the phone call ended . Now I'm gonna be all alone in uni from tomorrow.
