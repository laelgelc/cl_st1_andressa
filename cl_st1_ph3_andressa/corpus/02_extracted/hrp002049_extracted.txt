I don’t think I ever felt this level of loneliness even when it was just me. What can you do to keep your mind off of it? How do you feel less depressed when you hear them laughing and see them smiling when you feel alone in your home? I don’t know maybe I’m just rambling. I don’t know where else to go. It’d just be nice to get advise, this loneliness makes me feel ill. :/
