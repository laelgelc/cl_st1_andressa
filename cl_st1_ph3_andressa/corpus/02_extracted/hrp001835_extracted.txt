I was the phone with my mother talking about how I'm a bit lonely and thinking of making friends. Not in a sad way, I do my best to keep my tone light hearted or jovial whenever I can.

Her reaction:

*alarmed:* Friends? You want to make friends? You understand friends take *effort* right? We could find you a pottery club. Granted all your friends would be old ladies...

  
She doesn't mean anything bad, but ouch. Yeah. I am a sad sack so I get the effort commentary but ouch lol
