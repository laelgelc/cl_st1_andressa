All my friends are gone for uni and I decided to stay home. It’s been almost 4weeks and I’ve made no stable friendships and it’s all just so infuriating because all my friends have their own knew friend groups and they go out and have fun while I’m stuck at home doing nothing all alone everyday. Yes I go out by myself but it’s so lonely when once you had a couple really good friends and now no one talks to you unless you reach out to them first.
