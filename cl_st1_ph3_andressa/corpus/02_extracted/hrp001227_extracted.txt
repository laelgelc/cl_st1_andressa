I’ve been thinking lately, a lot of us are lonely but I’m trying to understand what we’re all struggling with in that loneliness. 

I was having a conversation with a colleague and they said they felt lonely but they don’t know how to talk to people. Whereas I feel lonely because I think I’m too much. 

So I’m wondering:
 
1. What makes you all feel lonely? 
2. What are some thoughts you have about being lonely? 
3. What do you find difficult to do that could help you not be lonely?
4. What have you tried to not be lonely and you feel it didn’t work? 
5. Has anyone done something that made you feel less lonely?
6. What do you think people misunderstand about you most?
7. What do you think is your reason for loneliness?

Would love to know everyone’s thoughts? Maybe there’s something we can learn from each other in this thread? Idk.
