I was recently admitted involuntarily to a behavioral health unit for four days. It followed a severe manic episode paired with a deep depressive crash and suicidal ideation. I was contemplating taking a handful of pills. I didn’t take them. Instead, I reached out to my psychiatrist because I knew I was not safe and needed help. That decision led to my admission.

The experience itself wasn’t horrific, but it wasn’t comfortable either. It was very clinical, very stripped down, and very controlled. I did meet some genuinely kind people while I was there, and there was a quiet sense of shared understanding that comes from being surrounded by others who are also struggling. In that sense, it wasn’t all bad.
What was especially difficult for me was the dysphoria. I’m a trans woman, and losing access to basic things that help me feel like myself hit harder than I expected. I couldn’t shave, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t dress in affirming clothes. Even something as simple as being handed a 2-in-1 shampoo and body wash felt dehumanizing in a weird way like individuality and self-care were completely erased. It sounds trivial, but when your sense of self is already fragile, those things matter.

I went in during a period where my manic state had pushed me into unhealthy coping mechanisms, especially alcohol. Instead of communicating, slowing down, or asking for help, I drank and hurt people I care about. One of the things I’m most grateful for now is that I’ve been able to take accountability for that and make amends. I’ve had difficult but healing conversations since getting out.

I didn’t walk out cured. But I did walk out more grounded, more aware of my warning signs, and more committed to choosing help over self-destruction. Reaching out before I crossed a point of no return is something I’m proud of.

Thanks for reading. If anyone would like to reach out and talk I would welcome pretty much any conversation. I've been feeling a little alone since getting out and a fresh start with some new friends sounds nice. :3
