Just how I’m feeling.

There’s a point I reached when I was alone.

That I’d have to make my own happiness when people I’d hoped be there left me alone or never showed up.

So I work on myself

Treat myself the way I’d treat someone I’d love.

Being someone worth loving

Loving myself.

Improving my life.

My body.

My skills

My social life

My career

My family.

All because no one else will do that for me.

Finding so much worth in myself and life.

Yet at the end of the day no one is there to celebrate it with me.

For all my life.

Because you have no choice but to pick yourself back up.

And keep going.

Because you can’t stay down no matter how much you to want.

My life is great on my own…
