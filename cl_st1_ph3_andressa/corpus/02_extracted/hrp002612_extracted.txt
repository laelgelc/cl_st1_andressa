I am 20 I have a few friends but no one rn that I would call “close”. I’ve never been in a long term relationship before.
Ever since I was a kid I’ve always been good by myself. I’ve never been the type of person that needed other people around them or they feel uncomfortable. I am completely content with keeping to myself and in my own world and I don’t feel pressure to change that part of me because of what other people might say. That being said my dream is to one day have a family and have a few close friends, close enough to be able to call my brothers. Ik the best thing to do is to go out and meet new people or try and improve the existing relationships I have now (which I’m trying my best to do) but because I am content by myself I just don’t have that experience to know how to make those truly close relationships. Is there any advice that anyone would give to help me out? Thank you
