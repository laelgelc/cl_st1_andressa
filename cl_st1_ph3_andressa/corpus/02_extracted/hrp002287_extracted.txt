I just feel like there’s no point in trying to find new people. I feel like I’m terrible at picking friends because they always turn out to be disappoints that only seem to care about themselves. Everyone wants me to support them and their problems but no one gets to know me like that or listens to my problems when I need support. I don’t really feel like I have anyone lately and I basically stopped talking to the few I did have because seems like they are just so self involved. My therapist reminded me how I can’t make connections sitting at home. Ok sure but it’s not like I can just go out and meet a new friend so easily. When I try to make connections with new people it’s like they aren’t interested. It’s like everyone wants something for themselves. Where are all the genuine people? Sometimes I think it’s better sitting by myself than dealing with that but it still fucking sucks.
