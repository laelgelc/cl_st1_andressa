I'm 22 from US and my parents were divorced years ago and they didn't even have the balls to support my lil sister since then and im the one who's working three jobs just to end my meets and pay our bills. I had to stopped college just to focus on my work and im always crying since i know im not that old to have this kind of responsibility but i have no choice, don't get me wrong i really do love my lil sister and she's all i need but being left here without even a small support? that's really insane. I really don't get it why they already have their own family and didn't even bother to help us even i asked them a lil support even not for me, just for my lil sister. Damn it. I really hate both of my parents for leaving us. Sorry guys I just really want someone to listen.
