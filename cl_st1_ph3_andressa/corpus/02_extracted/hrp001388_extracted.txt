Hi everyone, I moved multiple times and oftern felt lonely. This led me to explore a tiny side project idea called Breakice: helping curious people meet offline in small groups.

It's just an idea so far and I’m trying to decide if it’s worth building in my free time. I’m collecting honest feedback.

I made a short concept page and an anonymous 2-minute survey. I’ll put the link in the first comment to avoid link spam.

Thanks for helping!
