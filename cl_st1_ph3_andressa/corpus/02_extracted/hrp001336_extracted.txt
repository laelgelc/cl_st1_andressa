I think one of my saddest self realization is knowing the people who really love or had loved me never really understood me or simply loved a version of me in their heads. 

And the ones that really got me are often unavailable or distant. It's been probably about 24 years of dating and break ups but never really finding someone that can fill this void. I know we're all responsible for our own happiness but it would really be nice to have someone to actually share this with. I also found that alot of my friendships tend to be superficial and so fragile and as someone who gives a lot to people it sucks knowing that I'm just the floater friend.

The irony is that when people see me , they think I'm a socially well adjusted person who probably is popular or at least has a few best friends. I guess not. I know it's childish but sometimes I feel like disappearing from the world just to see who would actually notice that I'm missing.
