After numerous attempts to find friends, I came to the conclusion that my existence itself was harmful to others. My terrible appearance aside, I am a bad person in my own right, causing harm and constantly hurting others. 
I haven't been in contact with anyone for the past three years. But I'm still trying to study at university, despite this. My invisibility has become even more of a nuisance to those around me because my classmates hate me for being silent, boring, and unable to communicate.
People don't tolerate me in any form. No one likes me, no matter what I do. And I don't know what to do with myself now. 

I'm betraying myself by writing this post. Not a single word of me should remain. My greatest dream is for all information about me to be deleted. So that my birth certificate and passport never exist. So that my parents (the only people who know me) forget about me. And so that I never exist.
