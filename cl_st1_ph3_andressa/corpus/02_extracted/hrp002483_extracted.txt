Yesterday a needed help and a person reached out to me under post, we ended up talking for 3 hours straight, not judging each other, promising to meet and talk with each other, having personal talk saying how terrible ghosting and cheating is, promising we would never ghost each other

in the end they blocked me, hours after we agreed to be friends with each other amd talk again later, im at complete loss, feeling utterly broken.... why promise all such things only to do them hours later.... i genuialy dont know what to do at this point...
