I'm going through a very bad breakup. I'm anxious preoccupied she's avoidant which is the worst attachment pairing for dating. I finally caught on to the fact that she may have been emotionally using me for 8 months (that's how long we've been talking) I don't think she was genuinely in love w me, she may have had feelings for me but that's doesn't mean true love. She did and said a lot of things that shows she wasn't seriously committed to me. I made a long 1 hour long video explaining  things in detail on a dead YouTube channel if anyone is interested in hearing my story and offering support. It's not about getting views on my channel, the channel is dead I've just gotten to a point where I'm pretty much on a mental breakdown. The foundation of everything was built on people spreading false allegations about me. It goes much deeper than just a breakup, any support is welcomed
