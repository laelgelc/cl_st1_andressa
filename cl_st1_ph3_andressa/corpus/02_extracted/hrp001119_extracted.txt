The first 2-3 hours after waking up this Saturday were truly awful, and I notice it’s getting a little worse each time.

Another day I’ll spend alone, just like all the days before and probably all the ones still to come.

It’s this physical absence of a woman who genuinely likes me – physically and emotionally.

One who wants to be with me!

One who desires me.

Even more, one who wants me to be there for her. One who feels comfortable and safe with me, cared for.

One I’m allowed to be there for.

One who wants to be there for me.
