Last night I went and saw Terminator and I was the only one in the theater. Epic win. I live in a town of only about 20k people so it’s usually not too crowded anyway and I always go in the middle of the week since even less people will be there. 
The movie was great. Hard to beat T2 cause it set the bar so high but it was definitely worth seeing it on the big screen. I saw T2 in the theater too when it came out and that was packed, there’s no way I would ever go into a packed house again.
