I was for Thanksgiving & I will be for Christmas and new years. 

One day i will have a good family that won't drive me to make a choice like this. As sad as it may be, i dont have anxiety anymore. I don't walk on eggshells. I'm handling things like an adult... something I was kept from doing for multiple reasons i will leave unsaid.

Last night I went on a solo date. Dressed up & put on good cologne. It was beautiful. I like being by myself but of course this is that time of year when loneliness hits like a train. And even then there are times when I wonder why it came to this. Then I remember it's so that one day when (God willing) when I have babies our home will be one worth staying in and feeling safe in and feeling empowered in. Not interrogated or manipulated throughout the year except on holidays. 

For those of u who are in my position or worse. My heart goes out to you and I petition the Heavens for us all that we may soon have worthwhile company not just for a holiday but for a lifetime.
