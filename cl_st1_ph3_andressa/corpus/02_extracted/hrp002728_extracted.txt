I never thought that I would become so lonely that I would search for a place where I could talk about how alone I feel. The thing is that I don't really wanna make new friends and seek for more interaction with others, I just really wanted to know and be relieved that I ain't the only one I guess. I just needed the attention of one person to be honest, unfortunately they're gone because they choosed too. And well, now I just don't know what to do cus I had a routine with them and then I'm here, sitting in the dark of my room writing this because I don't even have the energy to do my school work that it's A LOT... if anyone wanna chat sometime I'm open to it... I like to be alone, but not like this, I'm at a point where this just brings more pain and I'm already depressed enough.
