Yo fam, what's wrong with this generation? I see more loneliness among the
genz guys than ever. We are a generation who has access to everything, yet we
can't make friends easily, we are getting lonely af. Honestly, making connections
is not hard at all. Let me tell you how.



I made Vooz co to combat loneliness among young peeps. Vooz is a new gen
video and text chat platform where you can meet strangers from anywhere. Just
hop into Vooz co, enter your interests and get paired with similar users. Pretty simple. You can also use the location filters to chat with people from your place
and plan a meet once comfortable. Gender filters will help you match with a
particular gender (I know you guys would use women filters 😉). The whole site
is AI moderated, any NSFW stuff will get you permanently banned - no place for
perverts!



If you are lonely, search Vooz on google and visit the website. You would love it
trust me :)
