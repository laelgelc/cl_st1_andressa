(This is a bit long, so stay with me.)

I stayed quiet so you wouldn’t notice.

Notice the crack in my voice,

the way my eyes begged for sleep 

even when I’d just woken up.

I stayed quiet 

because quiet people are easier to love —

or at least easier to ignore

  


I stayed quiet so you wouldn’t notice.

I taught my footsteps 

to sound like apologies. 

Trained my smile 

to arrive on time, 

even if my heart never did. 

I buried the noise inside me 

so deep 

even I forgot where I put it.

  


I said quiet, so you wouldn’t notice 

that I was slipping. 

That I was dissolving in plain sight. 

You said, 

“you’ve been distant lately.”

I almost laughed. 

Distant isn’t the word — 

ghost is. 

  


I stayed quiet so you wouldn’t notice 

the way nothing felt like home anymore. 

How I held conversations 

like they were breakable glass —

afraid one wrong word 

would make everyone walk away. 

So I said nothing. 

And they stayed. 

And I shattered anyway. 

  


I stayed quiet so you wouldn’t notice 

that I’ve stopped hoping.

That I’ve measured my worth 

in eye contact and 

how often I’m interrupted. 

That I flinch when someone says my name 

because it means I wasn’t invisible enough. 

  


I stayed quiet so you wouldn’t notice 

that I was begging for someone 

to see through the silence. 

That every small laugh 

was stitched together with shaking hands. 

That I wasn’t okay —

and I hadn’t been for a while. 

But no one asked. 

And I was too tired to start the sentence myself. 

So I stayed quiet. 

And you never noticed. 

And I learned to call that love.
