In my college, every guy just tries to make fun of someone else, they try to put someone down to show themselves up.

They will do the most irritating things just to get a reaction out of you and show u down.

It's very annoying, and the problem is if u don't do this u will often feel left out.

I hate this few people who do it a lot, like immediately as you show up the first thing they do is put you down, to get  a reaction of attention of everyone.

They have no intresting qualities about themselves to show hence they put you down, when you leave they find someone else, and if there is no one surprsongly they will talk nicely to you.

But the problem is even the good few people will be under the influence of such assholes and hence not feel like being friends with you, cuz who wants to be friends with someone who is always shown like an asshole.
And hence they also start calling you an asshole.

This same toxic environment existed in my 7th grade friend circle and i had left it, but now it's coming back in college, and for 4 years I'll have to be with these same people.

I don't know what to do
