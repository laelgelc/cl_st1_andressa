when i get groceries, it's always under 15 items; ordering only enough takeout food for one person, tickets for one, passenger seat in my car basically never moves position. never checking my phone because i rarely get texts. never any plans on my days off, just sleep or errands. going to be the beach, except it's the middle of the night because i work night shift and i'm only there just to think. getting asked at the bar "you just waiting for your friends to show up?" when i'm sitting alone at a table and having to break it to them that no, i'm there by myself for the night, and seeing the look of shock on their faces. never getting asked by my coworkers if i did anything fun on my days off. never getting asked about my dating life, because it doesn't even exist. anyone who shows even a little bit of kindness to me, i immediately cling onto, and then have to stop myself because i know how it will play out. being so used to doing things by myself that i can be entirely self sufficient. getting asked at the movie theater "you gonna share that with somebody?" when i order the extra large popcorn, and i don't want to lie, so i tell them the truth "nope, it's just me,".
