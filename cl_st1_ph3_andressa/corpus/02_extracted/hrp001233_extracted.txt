One of my core childhood friends and me parted ways after months of him dodging me regarding money that was owed. It hurts me a little bit because we were friends for so long but I’m at a point in my life where I can’t have people that take advantage of me cluttering my mind. My psyche is already so weak. I wonder if I made the right choice. I wish I was a kid again. I wish we were kids again. It was all so simple. I’ll miss him. I know I won’t even cross his mind. I know he meant more to me than I meant to him but it’s okay. I’ve learned to embrace this loneliness. It burns like a hot rod against my chest. It feels as though my diaphragm is about to rupture. It hurts but not as much as being the court jester.
