Feeling absolutely a loser, when i see a basic lifestyle of my friends. I feel they live a normal life having more friends, girl friend, enjoy life as they like. Its not jealous, its just that why can’t i get any of the same thing. 

They are all my friends but still i cant feel close them. They dont tell anything important, and i dont have anything important to involve them.

I feel like i dont have any own personality, intelligence, speak properly. Feeling absolutely bullshit.

Coming to Personal life, i have job with decent pay. Never had a Gf. Thats brings so much missing out feeling. Don’t know what to do.

I have tried some things still i am not getting over loser feels
