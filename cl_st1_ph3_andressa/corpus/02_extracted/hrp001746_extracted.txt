As a 24 year old woman, I get so tired of being alone on weekend nights. All my friends have husbands and every time I hear about them going out on date nights it makes me a bit sad. It’s been a long time being alone at this point and if anything it’s just gotten worse. Has anyone found ways to make it easier? Does time eventually heal?
