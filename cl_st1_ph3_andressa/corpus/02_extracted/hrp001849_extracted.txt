I (f26) struggle to make friends, I have a few friends but we're not close. I spend all my free time on my own, its embarrassing when a colleague asks me what I do on the weekend so always make things up. Ive tried being proactive and inviting friends to things, but I either get cancellations or just rejections or they forget.
Maybe because our lifestyle and interests aren't all the same it happens. Im also quite introverted but have been told im also welcoming and kind to everyone .I always make conversation first and can easily get out of my introverted bubble so have no problem talking  to people.
Maybe because I'm soft spoken and I do tend to stay home but thats because I dont have friends to do anything with or even a partner.i do enjoy shopping,cafes and going to the cinema alone though.

I struggle with dating too... I meet someone and im honest and open and they usually say they like it when people say how they feel and there's no guessing games, but their actions never match their words. Maybe im naive?

I recently went on a date with someone i've been talking to for a while. He was on his phone the whole time. I felt ignored, more empty than hurt.
I told him he didnt seem into me and he disagreed and wanted to meet again , so I said okay hoping it'd be different the next time. Ive had no reply since.

I have a bubbly personality but I've had people mistake this for me being stupid but im far from it. Im pretty as well and im good with making conversation, I've been told im a little quirky, but its because I dont take myself too seriously. 
I dont know where I'm going wrong and I'm trying to accept that it'll just be me by myself for my whole life but it hurts to accept this.
