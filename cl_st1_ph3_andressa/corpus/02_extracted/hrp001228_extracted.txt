I keep seeing my friends get crushed on by guys and it always makes me feel less than. Don't get me wrong, I also get crushed on sometimes, the thing is, they actually behave with decency around them, do nice things for them, they sometimes actually offer to buy them gifts and invite them places (sometimes i get to see this play out live, while they let me third wheel like an idiot and make sure I fully know it), even if my friends have no intentions of dating said guys and just keep them as friends, while the guys may fully know it but choose to stay delusional for some reason. Meanwhile, the way it plays out for me is the following: they try to get in my space, i make sure they know it's a no from me but still give them the chance to stay friends (because these people sometimes happen to be in our same social circle somehow), then suddenly they start excluding me from our social circle or ignore me. In extreme cases they just plainly turn into some kind of redpilled monsters and start calling me names, smear me to other people and so on. I never asked them to go the extra mile for me or hold them in a permanent gray area like some other people would do and waste their time, however why am i treated with this type of hostility while my friends are allowed to simply exist in the same space as them and not deal with the social turmoil as i do? I don't know if it has something to do with my attractiveness, on the contrary, most people would rate me as conventionally attractive, so i really don't know what could be the cause of this anomalies. I'm not wanting their validation by any means, if only i'm perfectly fine staying away especially from these kinds of people and somehow be thankful I get to vet them out of my proximity. It becomes painful to only see the ugly side of society in this way while people like my friends don't have to. It makes me ask myself why am I always the one treated different
