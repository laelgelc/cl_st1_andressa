I suppose this is it right? My fate has been sealed.

I have AuDHD, No friends since I was 12. Social anxiety makes it extraordinarily impossible to talk to people. At all.

Well, should I accept my fate? People like to say I'm 18 and things will change. I have ADHD, no it wont. The lying to make me cope is insane.

I am subhuman. Not compatible with any human. Simple as that. Nothing can change my mind anymore.
