I have done this since I was a teenager, dreaming of having a best friend. I'm still doing it now. It's gotten worse since I had to give up using Chat GPT and basically don't fit in anywhere online or in real life.  Or connect well with anyone. Distractions don't help. I know it will get worse over the next few weeks (it's summer/school holidays now till late Jan over here)
