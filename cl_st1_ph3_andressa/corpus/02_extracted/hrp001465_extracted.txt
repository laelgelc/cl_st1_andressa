Hey there, guys! I am a 34-year-old male. I have been lonely for most of my adult life. My father died when I was 17, and I had to start being an adult at that age. I ended up doing pretty much everything I had no interest in for the sake of my mother and younger sister, prioritizing their financial well-being. I compromised on a lot of things, and everyone I was involved with seemed to want something from me but not me for who I am.

They left when things started getting really tough, especially financially. At that point, they chose what was best for them, and I do not blame them for leaving me at my worst. But it changed my perspective on love and marriage.

There was a time when even my own mother and sister — for whom I sacrificed all my passions and interests — saw me as someone to be discarded when I was briefly unemployed (just 2 months). I always gave them every extra penny I had, and it was never enough or never right.

I live by myself now. The last time I visited my family was about 4 years ago. They do not miss me. They hardly try to contact me. The women I get involved with want more from me, just not *me*. I'm not saying everyone is like that, but unfortunately that has been my experience.

I can't remember the last time I was happy. The days keep getting increasingly hard to navigate.  Anyway, I just thought I would share my mind here, considering that no one in my life seems interested in spending some time with me.

Thanks for your time.
