So first things first I’m of course a loner. And while there are times I wish I had more friends the fact of the matter is that I enjoy being a loner. Which made me come to realize something. Every time I would see people together I would get jealous. I would always try to see if there was anyone else who is alone like me. For the longest time I figured I was sad because I’m alone and everyone else had someone but now I’m starting to realize the truth is I feel alone and weird in the fact I like to be a loner and that I feel as if I’m the only one out here who goes out and does things on my own. I wish I didn’t feel like I’m the only weirdo who did this stuff.
