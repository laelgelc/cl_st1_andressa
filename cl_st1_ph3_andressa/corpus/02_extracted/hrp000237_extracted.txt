Hello, was invited here. I guess I should introduce myself. 

My name is Elijah, I'm 15 I love video games, anime, and working out (trying to get back to it now). I'm down to talk about anything really, try to be open-minded and as kind as I can be because without kindness what else is there? 

Feel free to DM me, have a nice day.
