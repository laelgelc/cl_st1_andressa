21M — looking for friends
Hey, my name’s Vitaliy, I’m 21.
I’m really craving some genuine human connection right now. I’m going through a pretty rough phase in life and I’m kind of isolated from society at the moment, so I seriously miss meeting new people and having real, meaningful conversations.
A bit about me:
I’m 21 (yeah, still young but already tired 😅)
I love fiction and literary stuff — books mean a lot to me
Huge music nerd: I listen to tons of music, always hunting for something new. I also used to do some beatmaking
I’d be down to watch a series, movie, or even a cartoon together and then talk about it
I was studying to become a sailor, but due to life circumstances I’m currently on academic leave
I’m really curious about you — what you’re into, what inspires you, and what helps you keep going in life.
Sending hugs to everyone.
Hope we can become friends 🤍
P.S. English isn’t my native language — I’m still learning, so please be patient.
