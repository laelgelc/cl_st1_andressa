Im a fairly outgoing person, can chat about anything with anyone but most one on one connections don't last.  

Id vibe so well with someone then when we part ways it's all silence, maybe a random hi and bye sometimes. I thought meeting people out would be better than on net connections that leave me craving for more human interactions.
