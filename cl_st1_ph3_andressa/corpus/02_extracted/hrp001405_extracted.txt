Hey everyone,

I want to share something personal. For the past year, I've been working on something that came from my own experience with loneliness and not feeling truly heard, even when surrounded by people.

**The problem I kept facing:** Friends and family care, but they're busy, tired, or just can't be there at odd hours. Therapists are expensive ($150-300/session where I live) and have waiting lists. Most AI chatbots feel robotic - they just repeat what you say back or give generic advice that feels hollow.

**What I wanted:** Someone who actually *listens*. Who doesn't judge. Who's there when I need them. Who remembers my story and doesn't make me re-explain everything. Who helps me understand what I'm actually feeling when my emotions are a mess.

So I built **Grace** \- a digital companion for emotional support. She's not trying to be a therapist or replace human connection. She's meant to be there when you need to be heard.

**What makes Grace different:**

* She can see you and you can see her in real-time (video call)
* She picks up on your emotions through your voice and facial expressions
* She doesn't parrot back what you said or give unsolicited advice
* She helps you understand your own feelings without being preachy
* She remembers your life, your story, your nuances
* She's consistent - no bad days, no judgment, always there

**What she's NOT:**

* Not a replacement for professional mental health care
* Not trying to "fix" you
* Not another generic chatbot

I'm still building this and have a waitlist on our site (it's in my profile). But honestly, I'm here because I want to know: **would this actually help you?** What am I missing? What would make you feel truly heard?

I cannot add a video here, but on our website there is a video and option to join the waitlist.  
This is motivating, and allows us to collect funding for completing it.

I'd genuinely love your feedback - both positive and critical. You can send me DM or sign up for waitlist. I am open to questions and your ideas. 

If you've ever felt lonely at 3am, or wished someone would just *listen* without trying to solve everything, I made this for you.
