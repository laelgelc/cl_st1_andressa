Hi all, I hope you're all doing well.

I (M19) recently realised that no one in my life actually likes or cares about me. I don't have friends, and even my own parents care about me. 

A recent incident involving my friends where one assaulted me whilst drunk on a night out, and the others response them not asking how I was, but for money for the accommodation (fair but still hurt) then ghosting me. This made me realise that none of them actually care, nor like me. 

My own parents have openly voiced that they don't care about me, not that they don't like me, they don't care about me. The same way you don't care about some person you've never meet.

It's hard for me to make friends or even feel comfortable being out in public in general because of 3rd degree burns I have on my face and arm. (There's a post on my account talking about this more if you want to read)

I'm just wanted to tell someone. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this
