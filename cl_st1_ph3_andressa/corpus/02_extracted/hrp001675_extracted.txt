TW: Depression, Anxiety

Just venting, although if anyone has any suggestions, please, I'm all ears.

Me (M24) and a very small, tight-nit group of friends used to play games online regularly, about 1-3 times a week, plus meeting up once a week for stuff like DND.

I kept in touch with them after we left school 6 years ago to go to different universities. Recently, my severe depression and anxiety has led to circumstances that has pushed them away, which is my fault entirely.

Now that I have no one, I realise that the only reason I had any hobbies at all, was because of how much I enjoyed sharing my time with them.

I was never any good with games (apart from \*maybe\* Minecraft/DND lol), I only bought and played them to hang out with my 3 other friends. I played guitar for a looong time, but when my friends also started to pick up instruments, I really only kept up with them to have a reason to hang out and jam.

Without my friends, I have no actual hobbies, no interests, nothing. I can't just go out and find new people that share my interests, because my only interest was making my friends laugh.

Does anyone know where to start? My anxiety might not cope if I just walked into random activities and ask to be included... I'm terrified, but the emptiness terrifies me more...
