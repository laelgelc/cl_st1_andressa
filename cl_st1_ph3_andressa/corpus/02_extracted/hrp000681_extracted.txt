my girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me out of no where while we were in a great relationship state shes been receiving attention from tons of guys (posting suggestive photos online, posting a ton on her story, doubled her follower count in one day that was depleting during our relationship and even admitted to me the night before her ex texted her, i think it was significantly before though) i dont really care about it anymore- the main issue is i have dreams of her every night, i start the mornings off so depressed, if any woman is going through a similar situation and wants to share mutual comfort at night lmk, I’m a normal person, I have a healthy life, I have friends, recently started therapy, I’m in college, but I just need a relationship I can rely on for comfort at night, preferably mutual, I live in USA, VA if that makes it better for anyone.
