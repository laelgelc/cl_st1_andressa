For the first two years of college, I mostly stayed in the lab. My roommate situation wasn’t good, and to avoid being in my room, I would spend almost 15 hours a day there and only go back to sleep. I was surrounded by people who talked to each other, laughed, and had their own groups, while I stayed alone. Those two years were genuinely miserable and then, I changed my room for the better.

Classes weren’t much better either. I felt invisible most of the time. There was a boy who liked me and I also had interest in knowing him better and, I started hoping his company might turn into something real. Since we knew each other and were in the same class, I would expect him to talk to me or acknowledge me when he saw me alone. Instead, he would disappear for months at a time and then behave like a complete stranger when we crossed paths. That confusion and silence used to eat me up. This cycle went on and off for more than a year in different forms, and eventually I had to let those expectations die.


College is about to end and I have offer for internship from a good company so it's going well career wise as of now but there are things eating me up from inside and i don't feel i belong here; my current roommate is extremely extroverted. She can talk endlessly about herself and considers me as one of her very good friends, but the moment I try to share something, she doesn’t really listen. It feels like she exists in her own world and just wants attention, and that makes me feel even more unheard.


After spending so long feeling isolated and unseen, I don’t know how to deal with this emotionally. How do you combat this kind of loneliness, especially when it’s been building up for years and college is ending because corporate world isn't better either.
