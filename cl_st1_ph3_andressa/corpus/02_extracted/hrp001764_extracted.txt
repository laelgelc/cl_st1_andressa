Hi to anyone who reads,

I am desperately lonely. I’ve been lonely all my life. I’m now 27, almost 28. I’ve never been able to connect to others in a way other people seem to. I’m never first priority, never someone others are desperate to be around, I never just…’fit’. 

Over the years, I’ve developed skills on how to talk to people. Sometimes I make friends, or acquaintances, but it never lasts. They always leave me,  the cycle always repeats. 

I don’t know what’s so wrong with me that people just don’t desire me the way they do others. I’m not thought of, not invited, not included. 

I straight-up asked my current friendship(?) group if I’d done something wrong and why people don’t like me, want to be around me, or hang out. Their replies were…wishy-washy. “We’re too busy to”, it boiled down to. 

But they aren’t. I know for a fact they text eachother, go to places together. For god’s sake, plans were made right in front of me and I was not once thought of or asked if I’d like to come. 

WHY??! I don’t understand. What is so bad about me, why doesn’t anyone want me?
