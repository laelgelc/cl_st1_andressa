tiktok showed me a video of someone saying "you try to help that lonely person in their 20s by befriending them. DON'T. There's a reason they're lonely." - when I read this, a part of me knew this is true. At least in my case. I kept scrolling though so the algorithm won't think I'm interested.

I try to make myself as unapproachable as I can. I never make eye-contact with anyone. People say I have a RBF but part of it is intentional. I'm trying to look as evil as I can, because that's what you used to do in HS so people wouldn't mess with you. When someone talks to me, I try to give the most brief, unremarkable answers. I'm basically trying to be invisible. And I'd say I'm pretty successful! I don't talk to anyone irl except maybe once or twice a week. I've successfully become invisible in the spaces I have to inhabit. And that's good. I don't want people to know or remember me. If they knew me, they'd see the failure I am. But being a failure is also my fault, so I deserve to be cast aside like rubbish.

I'm 24 and it definitely doesn't feel like I'm living anymore. It feels like I missed my chance years ago and now I'm just sitting through the epilogue. Also, I'm way too big of a burden. I have a lot on my mind, so if anyone were to befriend me, I'd chew their ears off. That's also why it's pointless to look for friends here, they'll just ghost me too because the problem is me. Oh well, I hope this is long and boring enough so nobody will read it. 

Some people say it's understandable because my mom died, but I never felt anything about that because I'm cold and unfeeling like that. Besides, every single day I read a more tragic story on here than that, so that's not an excuse. Who cares? She had no other sons, so ultimately it only concerns me, and I'm basically no longer here, so whatever. I just run on autopilot, assuming that it's over soon. Recently I collapsed from a reoccurring stomach pain again, maybe next time will be last.
