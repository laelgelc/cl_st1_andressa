I recently ended a 10 year relationship. 

I was about as happy in the relationship as I am out of it, though just in different areas of life. 

Yet when I look around and see couples I feel like I'm missing out. 

It's as if my body says relationships are good but my mind says I don't need them. 

Anyone else experience this?
