Hi, I'm going through tough times. I (M24) will be done with my master's degree in few months and I feel like my life is a terrible mistake in some ways. 
I have no friends, no family, not dated anyone in more than a year. I just feel so lonely and I wish I had real connections with some people. I don't really know which path I took that led me to this point but it's a mess. 
I just wondered if anyone wanted to talk sometimes. I'm from France if anyone wanted to. (Precision for time zones and stuff)
