I'm a single 47 year old guy. I dont have single friends. When im out running errands. I try to talk to women here and there. I try to make sure they are around my age. They recently opened a new Trader Joes. I went in one morning and loaded up on groceries for the week. While at the check out counter I wad chatting with cashier about how excited i was a Trader Joes was near me now. I knew she was significantly younger than me but got the sense she was kind of checking me out. A week later, im there again for just a couple things and bump into her. Her face lit up and she had this huge smile. After that I went to go see my the girl that trims my beard. She's 23. I was the only customer so the two other girls just sat near and we chatted. The other two kept telling me how awesome my beard is starting to look. This made me think. I get along with people significantly younger than me. Im starting to think, what if one day I meet someone awesome but significantly younger than me and it works. Would it be so bad if a 47 year old dude meets a significantly younger woman and it works?
