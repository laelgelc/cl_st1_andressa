Ok where do I start, so the other day I was talking to a girl on snap and I thought it was kinda going well until suddenly it wasn’t going well and we just fell off and stopped talking. That’s how most of my talking stages have been, the moment it starts going well for me it eventually falls apart. Sometimes I feel like I’m cursed since most of my talking stages have ended the same way. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been in a relationship and ever since then I’ve felt hopeless, sad, depressed. Ever since my mental health deteriorated I’ve been in a dark place and I’ve felt like god has abandoned me but ik that’s not the case. I wish life would get better for me and I could be happier but ik I’ll never be happy again and I’ll always be lonely. I hope one day I could just die so I don’t have to continue living like this and feeling this way. And as for me being broke as fuck I’ve tried getting jobs everywhere and I’ve been turned down, about two months ago I applied to cvs and they sent me an email last night saying how the position I chose was not available. Unemployment is another reason my mental health is so fucked.
