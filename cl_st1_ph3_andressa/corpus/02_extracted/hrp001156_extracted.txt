I (m24) was feeling lonely yesterday. I had a chat with a friend about dating because im on hinge like 3 weeks now. No matches, no likes, no nothing. She said that maybe its not for me. It hurt really bad (because she used "😅" after the message.) Today i woke up not only in mental pain but also in physical pain. My body is tired, im tired mentally. I don't know if i should keep trying and looking out for love or just quit. Im sad, i just wanna be held and told that I'm a good person. I don't know how much lonely nights, mornings and days i can go. Im sorry to be a bother sometimes, i don't mean to be. But i am loveable, right? I wanna have someone, just one person who gets me. It feels like im out of breath sometimes. I hope it gets better soon
