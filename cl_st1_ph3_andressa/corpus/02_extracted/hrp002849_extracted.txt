I have spent the last month inside my room (literally) without stepping a foot out of my apartment. Today I went to a bar near my apartment but even so I cannot talk to anyone or feel a connection or whatever… anyway I am really really alone I just broke up with my girlfriend because she cheated me and she was literally the only person I had. I‘m in a tough spot right now I just can’t see progression or improvment ahead of me. I am 21, live with my parents that pretty much hate me, and have ZERO friends. I don’t have anyone to message. I’m looking for a job atm, and dropped out of college bc there was a rumor that I was a nazi (which is a lie). Anyway it was just bs, but I received some threats from some people. I really wanted to form a band bc I play a lot of instruments really well but I just don’t know anyone. Maybe I’m just gonna do shit on my own like noise/industrial (maybe black metal) that you can do all by yourself. After that I’m gonna play in some places and then I’ll finally meet some peopl. But it’s been tough. I feel like shit! I spend most of my day in the shower sitting in the tub and letting the water wash my pain. I just don’t know what to do. Luckily I have a pretty good financial situation (enough to study in other country) bc of my parents… they gave me the option to do college in other  country and maybe I’ll do that. Maybe it’s gonna be good for me but idk. The noise/industrial scene in europe it’s pretty good and when I finish college I’m going to stay there and play some shows (besides working). I’m from sao paulo, Brazil btw. So what should I do in ur opinion?…..
