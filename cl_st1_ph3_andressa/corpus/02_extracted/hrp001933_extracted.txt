I have a husband, two kids, a perfectly fine house…But sometimes I still feel like I’m on the outside looking in.

Dinner conversations are mostly logistics. My husband and I barely talk unless it’s about schedules. The kids are older now — teens — always in their rooms with headphones on.

And I get it. Everyone’s busy. Even my closest friends are caught up in their own lives, families, work stuff.I totally understand, but it still leaves me wondering:

*When did I stop having people to really talk to?* Not about tasks. Not about what’s for dinner. Just… about how I’m doing. And honestly, I don’t even know how I’m doing half the time.
