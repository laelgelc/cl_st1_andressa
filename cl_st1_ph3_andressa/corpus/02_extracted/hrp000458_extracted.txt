hi im 15F. and i feel like i have no genuine friends, or anyone to reach out to exactly the way i want. i don’t really post on reddit at all but im in the mood to complain about how hard it seems to be for me to make genuine friends, i think i’ve done it once my whole life. but still i guess i can’t pile all my loneliness onto one person, who has plenty of other (closer) friends. my dilemma probably is not being in school, which is ironic because my reason for leaving was social anxiety. but i guess my question is how do i meet people, and how do i interact with people in general? i think my shyness has always left me feeling subhuman compared to my peers, which is stopping me from ever interacting first out of fear of getting a reaction of disgust or something? i don’t know. im so angry at myself i feel like its all my fault for not forcing myself into social situations. i know it might be a thing that comes to me as i get older. but i don’t think i can wait anymore when i just feel more and more depressed by the day. i don’t know if theres a genuine reason to my problem. something like me being unlikeable? or maybe its just the area im in??? this whole thing probably makes no sense lol im not the best at writing. but im bored so atleast im typing something!!!
