It's my birthday today. I'm 29. I haven't heard from anyone. Not my parents, siblings, grandparents. Not friends. No one.
I booked myself a couple nights in a spa and I'm literally sat in my hotel room crying because of how alone I am. I've done quite a bit of solo travel before but I've been able to convince myself it's because I enjoy it, rather than because I have no one that would want to come with me. But today, it's really hit home just how alone I am. 29 years and I have nothing to show for it, and no one to share it with. I'm autistic and I'm scared that this is it for the rest of my life. God, I feel so hollow.
