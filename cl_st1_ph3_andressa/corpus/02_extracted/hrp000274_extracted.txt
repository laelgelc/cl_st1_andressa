Ever since I was a little kid I've been by myself. Connection with other human beings has turned into an alien concept. I've been trying to pin the reason for years. Is it my height? My face? My voice? Maybe it's the things I talk about. I'm so isolated from others I can't stand it anymore. I think  I've turned into a bitter asshole about it. I blame everyone else for my own problem but I still can't figure out what that problem is. I hope I die young rather than old so it's tragic instead of pathetic. I don't want to die to sad forgotten man holed up in an apartment. Whatever could have made me human was lost a long time ago. I think it's too late to join my species. There's nothing for me here.
