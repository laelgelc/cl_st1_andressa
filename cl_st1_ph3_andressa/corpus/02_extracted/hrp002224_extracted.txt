Hi,

I am feeling really down and would like some friendly advice. 

Since graduation (almost 4 years ago), i have been stuck and struggling to enter the job market. I have done nothing but internships and have tried to enter so many different pathways (i even taught myself how to code). As a result, I soo behind from where the people I graduated with, i have lost touch with everyone and I’m the lowest i have ever been. I enjoy my own company so it hasn’t really been affecting me the last few years but i think it’s catching up to me. 

I have always done well when i put my mind to things. But the one place (career) that i have put all of my effort into has amounted to nothing. This has caused me to be very disconnected from life and lose confidence in myself. I am even scared to speak about myself as i have nothing to say about myself. 

I am tried of doing this and feel disappointed and hate myself everyday for the life that i am living. 

Can someone help me with how I continue on with life as i am soo tired, lonely and in a constant state of sadness. 

Thank you.
