Sorry, I’m using google translate, my English is not good enough. 

Hello. I'm writing here on Reddit in hopes of finding support or some advice. I am 21 years old and recently I moved away from my parents and began to live alone because of my new job. The first two months seemed like living in hell for me... It had never been so difficult for me, both mentally and physically. It’s so lonely that you just think you’re slowly going crazy. I cried every night, my heart was very heavy, I had no one to talk to, all my online friends left me and im all here by myself. At work, any motivation disappears, and you struggle to get out of bed. Sometimes I just want to give up everything and go back to my family. I really miss love and care, moral support, knowing that someone is nearby and will always support you. Sometimes I just want a simple hug. And when they hug you, they will tell you “Everything is fine, I’m here with you”. At work, I start to stress a lot, and due to a lot of stress, I started having panic attacks and always feeling that I can’t fully breathe, especially at night, knowing that I am all alone and there was no one around to calm me down was simply unbearable. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore, every day is worse than the next.
