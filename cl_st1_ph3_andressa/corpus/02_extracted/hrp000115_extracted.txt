I (19M) think the type of person that I am makes me genuinely a pain to be a friend with, which (along with a plethora of other reasons) is probably why I struggle with friendships.

I severely dislike interacting with people who use any social media, social media defined here as an online platform for socializing with a set rating system (likes/dislikes). I grew up without social media (other than YouTube) and for some reason I just can't connect with people who use it. I should probably look into that further but I currently interact with zero people in that box so it's a little hard to examine.

I have basically zero hobbies as all of them are half-arsed and my interests are no better, always fluctuating. I'm a 4chan scroller cause I appreciate their honesty but I'm too much of an anxious self-conscious loser to actually communicate with the harsh but genuine anons.

My only redeemable trait which I have sifted from countless conversations with people in a state that I can barely recognize myself in is that I am a good listener. Unfortunately I'm completely abhorrent at voicing empathy or expressing my thoughts clearly in the moment. I think I genuinely make people feel worse after they vent to me, which makes me want to off myself for being such a such a disgusting, deplorable human being.

um if you want to be friends with me sure but you might have something wrong with your head no offense.
