At 30 years old and having been single for roughly 29.5 of them, I guess you can say I've reached the stage of acceptance that changing that fact just won't/can't happen. And while I'm sure my opinion won't be shared by many, here it is, anyway.

A time ago, I *was* entranced by the bullshit normies love to spew from atop their pedestal, trying to make *me* feel lesser than what I am, when really, they're the feeble, dependent ones. They're dependent on praise and validation. 

'But humans are social creatures.'
'Everyone desires love and affection.'

I'm living proof that these are lies. I honestly could live my days without interacting with another human and not miss it in the very least. 

And not to sound like a pessimist (HA!), but "love" really is a lie to me. I have no reason to believe in it. What people claim to do out of "love", I see as being done either out of obligation or in efforts of gaining favor. Nothing more.

'Thinking like that is gonna keep you alone and miserable....'

I anticipate being left alone. It clearly works out best for everyone. But your 'miserable' is my 'normal'. So what do I really have to fear?
