Hello, my name is Brandon and my grandma recently passed away few months ago. She was the only family I had. I have my Instagram account. I'm not the type of guy to really have social media. I haven't had time to make friends since I spent the last few years working to support my grandma. I can drop my handle. I'LL FOLLOW BACK!! It's: Brandflaking_
