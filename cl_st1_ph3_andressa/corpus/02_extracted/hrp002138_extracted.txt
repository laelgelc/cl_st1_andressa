just turned 18 and I’ve never felt this lonely in my life, i missed out on so many things, no relationships , no parties , no healthy genuine friendships. I spent my teenage years in my room because i don’t have my own person that i can hangout with and call my childhood friend, everyone is so self centred and i feel like an embarrassment everytime i open my mouth
