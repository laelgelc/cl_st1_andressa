Loneliness is such an odd feeling in the modern world. I had to delete instagram because it felt like, especially in crisis, I had all these spectators, and not a soul to really talk to. I know I needed a therapist. I know my friends are here for me, but the things that I need them to be here for I can’t put on them because I can’t even handle them myself. And I am a handler. I’m so tired of being resilient. Sometimes it just feels like everything I’ve healed crumbles like a home with no support beams. I feel like I have to act like the world‘s not on fire? It doesn’t feel normal. 

I think I’m the lonely I ever felt because I’m having issues with my mom and I realize that in the midst of all my friends who are mostly coupled and they all have people to go home to at the end of the night. I’m not even picked by my mom . I’m no one’s first choice. I’m trying to be my own first choice, but it’s so hard to see everyone around you be normal enough to have someone loves them. I just feel like I was fucked from the Start. So fucked I’ve had two therapist ghosted after intake. 

The things that I feel alone about, I would hate for anyone to relate, but it just feels like no one really gets it. And it’s not like I’ve had the worst life ever it just is relentless. 

I’m feeling like my time will expire soon. Every day I feel like I’m holding on for others not for myself and I know someday I will take my life.
