does anyone else know what it feels like to be completely alone? people will talk about feeling alone, alone while surrounded by friends, on and on, but few are actually alone. i am alone. i have nobody in my life and it took everything in me just to write this. i dont know why i have, and i dont know what will come of doing so. i am alone. i dont know anyone, and nobody knows me. i am not being dramatic. i wish i was. there is nobody in my life. i dont know how to meet people. i can barely afford just not to be homeless. i dont know where i am even going with this. i dont have any friends. i dont even have a next of kin. i guess if anyone reads this then be thankful of the little that you do have because it could be nothing at all.
