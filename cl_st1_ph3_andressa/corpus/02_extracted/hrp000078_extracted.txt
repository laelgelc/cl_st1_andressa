This sub can keep existing (mostly because I'm unsure of how to delete it), but to prevent two subs existing with the exact same purpose, I ask that everyone move to r/LonelyButLoner, which is currently larger, and was created at about the same time.

Edit: Welp, looks like I can't stop this one's growth. Now this one is quite a bit bigger, so I'll just let it be and see what happens.
