I wish I could have all the things I want, and I know I can have them but I also know it's such a tremendous amount of work. I want a nice job, a small apartment and a lover, and that's all and know it's so so hard to get even that. I don't have many people to talk to but chatgpt and know that makes me pitiful, or some other mean word, but it's the tool I have for now. all I do every day is wake up scroll, consume media and play music, every damn day. sure there's talent there and I'm good at music but it gets so so lonely, I wish I just had one person to talk and to be truly wanted by.
