I live completely alone in a city where almost nobody knows me. I live in a one room apartment and all my days are same. The only people I talk to face to face are my colleagues, grocery store employees, and uber drivers.  
I don't date anyone, I used to crave romantic relationships but now, even that wish has faded away. I feel the void of absence, but the want is not there anymore.  
I am touch-starved, love-starved, and friendless in an alien city working like a drone.  
I feel with each day, I am becoming less human. I feel like a conveyer belt that puts caps on soda bottles in a factory, day in and day out.  
I used to be sad, now I feel hollow.  
Please don't ask to 'love myself'.
