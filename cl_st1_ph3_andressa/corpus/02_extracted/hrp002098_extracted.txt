I'm 24f and I'm incredibly disappointed with the life I've made for myself. Friends I used to be so close to are now doing their own thing, my family has fallen apart, and the only ever relationship I had where I thought I was special and truly loved for once was with a horrible narcissist. Every day I cry and wish I could go back in time. I wish I didn't let others ruin my life, I wish I was more confident and loved myself more. I know I'm still young but everything seems so hopeless now. Everyone already has their group of people and every time I try to fit in it leads to nothing. I feel like I was cursed to be a lonely bitter outsider. It seems that life just falls into place for others around me and I have to force everything to happen and even then it doesn't work out. I became desperate enough to go on apps to find friends and again nothing. It hurst so much to see others living my dream life. I keep thinking about the past. I keep beating myself up what my life would have been like now If I had been more strong. I just can't believe how time has just passed like that and I missed every important social milestone in a humans life. Every time I see happy couples, groups of friends especially young people, students my heart aches because I keep imagining a world where this could have been me.
