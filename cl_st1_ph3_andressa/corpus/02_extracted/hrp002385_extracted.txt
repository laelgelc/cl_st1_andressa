I grew up moving a lot, not for any one particular reason, just because of circumstances of life. I never really stayed anywhere for more than a couple years. I had plenty of friends, people who I liked talking to, that I kept talking to after I moved, but still. I'm just not built for this. And it hurts so bad. Waking up today and looking around at my life and knowing that there's nobody who... remembers me. Nobody knows me as anything other than my mask. I want so badly someone to know who I am, who I was, before I became so shut down, so trapped by everything that I am. I want to be able to be... that. I want to open up. I want to let someone in. I want to have a best friend, not just a bunch of people who I like hanging out with. It feels so fucking pathetic, but I find myself yearning for it so badly. Sometimes literally dreaming about having a person. Just one. Who knows me. Who I can feel comfortable around. And then I wake up, cold and alone in the dark, staring down at my phone to no new messages, and everything around me feels so crushing and I feel so small. I want so badly to have the kind of relationship with someone where I can just. Hang out with them. Be around them. Enjoy their presence. Call and talk about our days. Do... nothing together. It sounds so beautiful and I'd give anything to have it but yet, here I am. Alone. So painfully alone, and completely unsure if I can ever even have it, or if my brain is too fucking damaged to ever let me be comfortable with anyone. I would do anything to have been born as anyone else.
