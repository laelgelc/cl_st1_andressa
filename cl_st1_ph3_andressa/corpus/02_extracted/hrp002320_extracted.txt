I’ve been struggling a lot lately with my friendships. Im always the one who texts first to check in and ask if my friends want to hang out. For the last 2 weeks I haven’t texted anyone first and only 1 (out of like 7) friend has reached out. I’m so sick and tired of putting in all the effort into these friendships that I thought were genuine only to realize that they don’t really give a fuck about me. 

I’m a pretty outgoing person so it’s easy for me to meet people but in all my years on this earth I think I’ve only developed an actual friendship with 1 or 2 people. I’ve learned to be comfortable being alone but it would be nice if a friend missed my presence. I really don’t know what to do :( 

At this point in my life I feel like being alone and cutting off these friendships would be ideal but I don’t want to be left completely alone in this world.
