I’m not necessarily speaking of love in a romantic context. Just love in general—love in all its shapes and sizes.

What if you realize that the one thing you’ve been longing for your whole life, is something you yourself can’t give?

Growing up, I’ve always seen myself as the victim. In my head were constant phrases and lines against everyone around me. Blaming the world, essentially.

“No one loves me enough.” 
“I’m always alone.”
“Why does no one listen to me?”

Anyone who outwardly expressed love to me was weak and disgusting. Just uncool in general. I’m a girl by the way, so this is not one of those toxic masculinity bullshit situations.

I don’t know what my point is, anyway. My whole life was built on thinking I wasn’t receiving enough love when in fact I was the one who wasn’t doing the giving. It hurts my pride to be wrong. 

I’ve been pretty much a loner my whole life, so I just don’t know if people are gonna stick. Not that they’re dysfunctional because I’m the dysfunctional one. I might leave because I don’t know how to love people the way they need to be loved. Love is a currency and I cannot pay it.

I wanna love but I don’t think I’ll ever be sure if I’m doing it right.
