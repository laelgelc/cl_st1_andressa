I don’t think my case is as extreme as I’ve seen with other people posting here but at least they have people commenting and showing they care but almost every time I post something here, nothing, no comments showing care or anything except that one time I put my god damn face here. This is why I can’t trust anyone, no one cares how I actually feel, no one bothers trying to know me better, and no one gives s**t when I actually do tell them something is wrong

And watch all you people in this subreddit just scroll by this and think nothing of it. 

I clearly can’t be myself here or anywhere except when I’m alone
