I have never felt so alone. Every year on my birthday, I don’t get celebrated let alone even acknowledged by anyone except for my immediate family. I make it a point to try to make each ‘friend’ of mine feel special on their day, remind them that the world is a better place bc they are in it…but no one does the same for me. After many years of this, I just stopped talking to my friends. It’s like unless I reach out to them, they don’t even bother with me. I cry every single year on my birthday (and during the holidays) bc it’s just another reminder that once my immediate family members are gone, I have no one. 

I’ve flat out said I’m depressed and no one even bats an eye. I feel invisible and like I don’t even matter. I’m over feeling this way and I don’t want to even try anymore. 💔
