Just wanted to share. Don’t really have any friends that would care/congratulate me so I’d like to do it here. Something I thought I would celebrate when it happened and looked forward to for a long time. Has been in the back of my mind for a while and I wanted to get it out there and see if it made me feel a bit better. Officially a published, and cited, author with a research paper, and now I’m on google scholar. Thanks for reading.
