Most of the time, during the day, I'm okay and not too bad. But at night, I always feel automatically lonely and shitty and just... really wish my life was different. It doesn't help I look disheveled and shitty and depressed. I feel like I'll never find anyone in life and that I'm too ugly... =(

I just needed to vent.
