I was in ICU over the summer, and my mobility and energy are still really effected, so I spent most of my time alone in my room :-( Obviously because  I can’t get out and about I’m not really seeing anyone, so I’m trying to figure out ways to connect with other humans while being ‘stuck’ at home at the moment. Does anyone have any suggestions?
