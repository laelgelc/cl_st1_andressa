There's just absolutely nothing in me anymore. Constant rejection and tone changes after I show my face to people. I look myself in the mirror and I just want to not feel anything anymore. I find myself just wanting to break down in the middle of a crowd of people and just sob like a baby. I try and be friendly by smiling, saying hello, waving and people intentionally avoid me. Even my own family does this to me and I just feel an utter sense of hopelessness and loneliness. Why cant anyone just love me?
