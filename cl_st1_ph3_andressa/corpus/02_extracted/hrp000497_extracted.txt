The best decision I could have ever made was going no contact with my "family" earlier this year. Broken people who can't see past their own hurt. So they put it on me. Now, I'm thriving. I have a safe/temporary residence, excelling in school, amazing friends irl & online, making break throughs in therapy, and excited for the future in ways I haven't felt since I was a child. I've never been this healthy & happy in my entire life. But it's Christmas... Sending all the lonely Love. We'll make it through this.🫂
