Im 17 days sober, I drank a lot to cope and it got worse when my best friend died(dog I grew up with since a kid im late 20s now) one friend left me when they gave me so much hope, they left me right when my best friend passed. I was getting over them,but now after remembering the taste of my favorite mead…i feel the pain again when they left me and im craving booze I looked to see if it was normal but all I got was a suicide hotline number which I asked but they’re very little help. I feel so alone and whatever hope I had was and is gone all I want to do is drink rn but I just cry
