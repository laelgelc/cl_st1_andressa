For obvious reasons, I'm writing from another account. I feel more and more lonely every day. Since I was born. I grew up in an intelligent, overprotective family. I have a lot of hobbies, like drawing. When I was little, I couldn't make friends with anyone. I rarely saw other children. Even now, I hardly see my peers. They think I'm weird and even bullied me cruelly. I live in a small village, and I won't be able to leave it. The only thing I have is the Internet. But even here I feel very lonely. I can't find a place for myself. My young soul wants freedom so much. I haven't been able to enjoy myself for more than half of my life, and I can't figure out how to do it. It's just hard for me. I feel like I'm lost in this vast world and will never be needed by anyone. No one is interested in the books and movies that I like. No one wants to look at my soul or even try to hear it. They only see me as a beautiful shell. No one likes to think deeply. I feel like a stranger in the whole world. Some might consider this nonsense, but... To understand that you might be lonely for the rest of your life... I'm not talking about romantic relationships. All I need is a sincere companion who can also feel deeply alone in this world. I don't need anything else. Sometimes I do not know what to do. Today is just one of those days. I know that the world is unfair, and I realize it. And yet... is there a way for me to fulfill my dream? Surely there are people like me (I apologize for the errors in the text. English is not my native language)

Thanks for taking a minute. Have a nice day
