Look, about a week ago, I broke up with this girl. The shameless bitch said she "got someone else." She dumped me right then and blocked her, threw away all her letters and the little gift she gave me. But you know what? I feel awful. Like, it's the second time this has happened to me. So, my question is, is this just my perception or is it real? Because I feel like a total failure. Something always seems to happen to me, something I don't know what, and it ends up going wrong, not just in relationships, but in general. It's terrible.
