Something is missing, something is changed.Am i overthinking or things are diff now . There's no excitement to try new things or meet anyone new , not even watch anything. It looks like I have lost the will to even live . Life is on repeat mode , gym stays excited but for a few days then again loneliness hits deeply . 

Chasing money , chasing health , chasing Friends ,chasing relationships , it's all hustling everywhere. I can't live like this forever. I don't see any future . 

There's no one in my life where I feel safe , it feels everywhere, everyone just talks with some motive .
Luck is so bad whenever I feel a little bit comfortable with someone either  someone moves or something happens and the bond breaks .

Am I being real to myself or am I fed up with this pretending role that I am playing ?
