All throughout my life I’ve been louder than usual I have diagnosed adhd and autism I try to treat everyone with respect and I would say I do a pretty good job of that all the women who I’ve had feelings for ether tell me I’m like a brother or I find out they laugh at me behind my back. I also try my hardest to have a smile even when I shouldn’t I pride myself in that. I’ve been builled by people I thought were my friends I’ve been builled by multiple teachers and almost got a felony because my teacher was upset I put my head down I’ve never fit i listen to rock/ metal and was bullied by people who listened to that to. I’ve lost all my childhood items to a hurricane and during that hurricane saved people (I’m not bragging). I try to do good wherever I am but I never get good in return I don’t expect to get good but it always gets worse after. Why can everyone around my be happy but I can’t. I applied for the army and got denied and by the time I got denied I had wasted 5 months of my life trying to get in while my recruiters made it as hard as possible. I can barely leave the house without the fear of someone laughing at me. I used to be able to talk to anyone walk up to them look them in the eye and say I’m me. I can’t even walk up to people and can barely look my family in the eyes let alone people. My dreams and goals seem meaningless my world is nothing but grey. I also graduated a year early I felt about 2 weeks of happiness. I see my family for about 6 hours a week and my friend I talk to online for about 5 hours I have no interaction with people no one to call. I’m so tired but everyday I hope I can or someone can drag me out of this abyss but I can’t and no one ever does.
