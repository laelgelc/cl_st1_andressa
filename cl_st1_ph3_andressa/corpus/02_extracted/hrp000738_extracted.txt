I'm 24 years old and a complete disappointment

5 months ago i moved far from my family to try to make a change. Now I lost my job, my roommate doesn't respect me and I don't feel at home in my own apartment. I can't move because my lease ends in 9 months, I'm unemployed and everything is expensive and I don't even know where I'd go.

I have no friends or social life of any kind, I'm too socially anxious to meet people and I can't maintain any kind of relationship anyway because I'm clearly not worth keeping around. I'm currently sitting on my bedroom floor crying because I'm a pathetic piece of shit and there's nothing I can do 

This is the second time I try to make a life by my own and both times failed miserably and I've lost all hope of ever succeeding in anything
