not really sure how to start this other than outright saying my friends are planning on kicking me out of the group. (not sure if it helps but im 13 and in 8th grade) basically, 3 or 4 of my friends are planning to kick me out of the group because i got mad one of them stabbed me with a pencil. i dont know WHY they're kicking me out but all i know is I'm not okay right now. I'm not even half way done through the school year and i have most of my classes with 2 of the people who are planning on making me leave the group. i hardly have any friends and i only have 1 online friend. please give advice, i really need it
