Just today, I realized I have no one to call/text speak to. Maybe it’s winter depression and I just got laid off from my job just recently, where I gave in my everything and management changes, they don’t need you. Finding a job sucks. 

Sitting in my bedroom floor, feeling I have never achieved anything. All this around me is worthless. Spending all the time to get everything together but I don’t have anything together. Just a piece of shit. Always thought something will workout, I was never this person who would feel like this, but never an expressive one. 

Maybe someday things will workout maybe not.
