Does anyone else feel like getting a maid and stuff like that doesn't feel right? My place is a mess but when i consider getting a maid, it just doesn't seem ok. Like tptb have conditioned ppl to be slaves and i feel wrong because most maids think they are just inferior and are around "rich" people who treat them like crap.

It just feels too easy and anything that's too easy comes with a catch...But also need my place cleaned so it's a catch 22.

Like i feel that being alone is amazing for a few years but eventually it becomes unsustainable.
