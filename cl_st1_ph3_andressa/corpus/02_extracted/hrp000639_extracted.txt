My friend and I met in 2018 and have been on and off since 2019. He considers himself a retired whore and brags on it a lot and how he’s changed for me. We recently found out I am pregnant and decided to stop beating around the bush and focus on being a family. He was in a relationship that ended because of the pregnancy. He, I guess went through my phone and had questions about former relationships. He pretty much said he didn’t think the baby was his and I asked him to leave. And he did. I was supposed to resign in a month and he would’ve provided for me and my daughter. And I also recently lost my car (like a week ago) which was a gift from a past relationship but caused some issues w me moving on. Also, I only got pregnant cause he wanted a baby and I am smart enough to know that’s dumb but it’s too late now. I wanna be comforted.
