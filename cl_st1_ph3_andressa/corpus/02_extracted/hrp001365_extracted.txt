Today I went back on those dating sites, and it reminded me of how socially awkward I am.



I came here to remind myself of how nice I used to feel in my own skin.

When I can just sit back on my own somewhere in public and be myself by myself and have my own confidence, do new things almost every day, and feel like I can almost lift the whole world by myself.

I miss these times...

I miss being myself...

Is it self-love that I'm doing wrong? Or do I need to go out and have a nice time alone, or to go and travel to another country by myself to declare to the whole world that I can do everything on my own...

That's actually how I used to be when I was a teenager.

To have a nice time by myself to get out of my comfort zone, even if it's a pain in the ass, but to live it and feel good at the end?



If your answer is "LOL, get a girlfriend!" Then I would say this: Do you know how many times I've tried? It never works, I just suck! Or the people suck, I don't think I like the chicks at the dating sites either, they all expect you to put on a show for them, I'm not a performer from the circus, my life is a joke, but I would't put on a show for some chick just to get her to like me.

All of them are all flashy and so fast, I just can't keep up.
