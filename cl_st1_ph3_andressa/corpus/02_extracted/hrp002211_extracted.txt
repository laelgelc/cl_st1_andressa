From LKG until now (college second year), I’ve never really had true friends. People usually talk nicely with me at first and act friendly, but later they end up using me and then abandoning me. Many times, I’ve been bullied, avoided, or blamed for things I didn’t even do even when others were clearly at fault.

I’m not an introvert by nature; I used to be quite extroverted. But after repeatedly being treated this way, I’ve slowly started becoming more introverted and guarded. To be honest, I’ve never experienced what genuine friendship actually feels like, and that hurts more than I can explain.

I keep wondering if something is wrong with me, or if I’ve just been surrounded by the wrong people all my life. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with feeling invisible or disposable in friendships?
