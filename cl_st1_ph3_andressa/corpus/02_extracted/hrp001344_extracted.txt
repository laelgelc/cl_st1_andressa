It used to be that I really minded being alone on special occasions like Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day, birthday, Easter, etc. But gradually, I become okay with it. It's just another day of being alone.

I have my own things to do, my own routine. In a way, I feel comfortable being this way. And I don't feel as bad as I used to be when I didn't have anyone to spend the occasion with me. Often, they don't message me either, unless it is my birthday.

It is not an ideal situation, but at least I am not feeling down or left out. Because I don't really want too much fuss anyway, I just want connection. So just messaging each other is enough for now.
