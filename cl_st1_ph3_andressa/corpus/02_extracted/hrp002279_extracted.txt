I'll be 20 in two months. Never had a big friend circle and never been in a relationship. I'm still a high school student because the type I went to lasts for 5 years instead of 4. This is my final semester but things got so bad that I'm now homeschooled (which I'm actually happy about). But now I don't really have friends. I had 1 best friend throughout HS but they refuse to be seen with me because they're afraid of getting bullied for being near me. Their words, not mine. So I cut them off (there's way more to this story but I'm not gonna get into it).

Currently I only text 2 people. Both of them are friends I suppose, one is a long distance friend and the other one actually lives just a couple streets away but doesn't want to hang out with me either.

I had another good friend, who now that I think of it fits the "best friend" label a lot more given that we've known each other since the first year of elementary and spent a lot of time hanging out since, but he hasn't been responding to my texts in months.

I have a part time job so at least I'm occupied with something during the weekends but that's it.

My dad thinks it's my fault.

I'm going mad because I practically don't have anyone in my life and constantly fall into this pit of self hatred due to my loneliness. My therapist doesn't provide much help and before anyone says, no, there aren't any clubs in my area that I could join.
