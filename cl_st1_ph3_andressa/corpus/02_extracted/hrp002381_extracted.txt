I am a M/33 and have been an outcast my whole life and I don't think that it will change anytime soon and it is the loneliest fucking feeling in the world. I have never had a friend group, never had a girlfriend never felt like I belonged anywhere.

 I don't even know how to fix it because I have been bullied most of my life and so now I just don't leave the house and I have social anxiety so it is really hard to talk to anyone and there is the fear that I'm still not going to be accepted by anyone or they will just bully me some more for everything different about myself. I am tired of being so fucking lonely.
