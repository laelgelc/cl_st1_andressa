Like when I meet someone new and I feel like they would you know understand me or care for me and my loneliness would end. I start to talking to them in my mind all the time and you know I explain everything to them but after a while it makes me sad and makes me feel like I'm delusional. And they usually leave after a while so it's like proven to me that I am just delusional.
