How are things going out there? On my side, it's been a positive, but very (very!) busy year. Some projects are going very positively. Two others I have not been able to pursue. Pushing Unalone forward is one of them. Even though I still very much believe it it, I had to postpone it, and this will likely not change until the at least summer next year. 

Anyway, what I wanted to say: wherever you are, whether you celebrate Christmas or not, whether you do it alone, or together with others: my thoughts are with you. Particularly today, and particularly if you feel lonely. 

Loneliness is what unites us.
