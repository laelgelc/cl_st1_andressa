The loneliness epidemic is your fault. You stay behind your screen, read what people write, see what they try to do, to build, to share, and the only comment you make is angry frustration or a short info dump. Nobody discusses deeply here.

These platforms have been censored to the brim. You cannot have discussions that matter, discussions that will make you feel seen, heard, considered like a human being.

People share their projects, aspirations, ideas, and can’t get a conversation going or even a like to save their lives. What do you feel when you look at that like button, at that positive signal, that hand extended? Does it physically hurt you to give it to others ? You hold the happiness of others in your hands and you do nothing. If you have to be a famous content creator to get support and feedback, the concentration of social meaning and socialization will continue to concentrate at the top.

The way you interact in the comments is also extremely poor. You do not care about who you’re talking to. You don’t care to make a connection, you can’t show emotions except anger or pity.

Human communication has been censored to extinction. The ones who remain are extremists and cold-blooded robots.

We are human, and we are many.
