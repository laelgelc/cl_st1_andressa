Hi , i am not much at any community or reddit specially ( probably 2nd post every in whole reddit ) 

So I've been really just feeling off now from life , yes i have no friends ( anymore ) complete graduation and try to do things mostly at Home , 

i mostly feel lonely , i had hobbies lost all because lonely when someone say find new let me clear it's just not work for me , i really don't have friends in irl just like 2 online that's all , ( i have good more best friend but they all left me ) 

The point is I work on many things on myself but for me other people who i care about are also inspiration in my art works , i remember when my all friends group kicked me out , i just lost the inspiration of animation and art work 

i feel very depressed in my life , they work on yourself and never really work , New hobbies and skills as I am also a ( INFP-T paid test results btw ) kind feel I am in just in loop hole , just feel blank in life now I am just 22 still , and honestly i hate when someone say good times comes ( not exactly hate a person but that sentance)

Because it's been the last 7 years I am in just a bad time ( including if I counte last year when my best friend kicked me out) 

Honestly I want some answers or like other perspectives on it , sure i just keep my self on auto pilot mode to keep myself atleast stable 

( as for my Grammar I hope it's not very bad not exactly a very good English speaker )
