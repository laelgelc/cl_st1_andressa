I've been feeling worse, I've slept a whole more just to avoid the feeling inside me. I've made career decisions that involve sacrifice,but, since I quit knowing it was the best for my future I've been having troubles with my girlfriend of 10 months, I have troubles making plans because I forget them, I keep reprogramming tasks or activities because I don't actually feel well. I'm feeling worthless, I've been feeling like I'm not enough. I don't know what to do. my relationship is one of the things that I appreciate more because she had made sacrifices for me and my career but I feel I'm drowning alone, I cannot open myself because I've never have someone that actually cared
