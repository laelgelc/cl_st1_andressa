So as the tag says just venting, since there isnt anyone to talk to writing all of this coz i tried getting someone to talk to but could not dont have friends that i can fall back on, tried getting someone to talk to via redit i guess its just sometime your ment to be alone or is it just because im a guy and have to go the extra mile to get help or even someone to talk to regardless of the platform or real life. Then there is this male ego thing of asking for help making you feel even worse i hope it was easier for guys who feel like this to get someone to talk to more often without having to feel like i made my self vulnerable by asking for help.
