so i have been lonely most of my life , never had a girlfriend or much friends.. i had a few friends but i wont call anyone best friend. now i finished college and i am home. all i have is my laptop where i play games. i have tried making friends online , even a gf but nothing lasts .. maybe after a week or 2 they leave. i find it hard to get a gf than friends cuz i am on the ugly side ,so whenever  i share my picture the person just ghosts me . because of my terrible breathing habits and not getting braces at the right time my face looks like a potatoe, i literally have no jaw . maybe i can try to lose some weight and look better but my body just dont lose weight . my metabolism is so fucked up . 

  
so now that i know whatever i do i wont get a gf but my mind .and heart ? it craves connection so much , it wants to be loved so bad . i just keep trying and getting disappointed everytime.. and i get sad over it . i wish i can just give up .. but my mind says.. maybe there is someone ... maybe if you try one more time .. you will find someone who doesnt care about what you look like.. maybe you will find someone whom you can vibe with , someone you can laugh together , to hold hands with .to talk about eachothers life... to be there eachother ..

  
my mind and heart just wont allow me to giveup on love but deep down i know i i will be forever single and never be loved
