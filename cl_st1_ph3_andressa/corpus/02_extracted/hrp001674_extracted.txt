This month gotta be the worst scenario that I ever had event at my birthday as well..

I feel okay with some few people who is still stick with me at first, but they suddenly ghosting me and leaving their account to inactivate.

It's really hurt so much, I decide to unfriend all of them who barely befriend or interact with me. Then, I realize I already lost so many people on my friendlist, it even hurt me more.

When my birthday come, I feel like no one come to celebrate my birthday. It make more depressed.

I never really want any of this happaned. I feel like a lonely stray dog without it master. 

I just wish I had a real friend, a real home to make me feel warm.
