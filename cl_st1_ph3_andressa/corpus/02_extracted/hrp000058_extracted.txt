my mom reads through all my texts right? that sounds normal. she also reads through my search history, also pretty normal. but you know what she also does? LOOKS THROUGH MY FUCKING NOTES AND GOOGLE DOCS! LIKE WHAT SHIT DO YOU THINK I WOULD BE HIDING IN THERE? MY GOOGLE DOCS AND SLIDES ARE CONNECTED TO MY SCHOOL ACCOUT (which is also really nosy btw) AND SHE KNOWS IT! IF SHE LOOKS THROUGH THOSE THEN SHE PROBABLY LOOKS THROUGH LIKE EVERYTHING ON MY PHONE TOO! but like seriously what the fuck. You think I’m gonna like hide all my secrets about like my “boyfriend” (she doesnt know im bi) and shit on my FUCKING NOTES? MIGHT AS WELL LOOK THROUGH EVERYTHING I HAVE IF YOUR GONNA BE THAT NOSY. LIKE JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK WOMAN YOU HAVE ISSUES. IM FUCKING 16 MOM STOP WITH THE HANDHOLDING!!!
sorry im just not in a good relationship with my mom right now and the only way I can cope with her is ranting about random shit she does
