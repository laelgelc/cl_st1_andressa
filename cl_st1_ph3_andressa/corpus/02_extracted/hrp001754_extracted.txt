Valentine's Day, it'll be the same as last year, no recognition, nobody takes action, nobody asks, it's like I'm a ghost and nobody cares, people say I'm attractive but it's only because most of my physical flaws are easy to hide, but I also have personality flaws due to personal reasons, it's just going to be another lonely day where not much happens. I'm bad at flirting, I barely go out. I was isolated for a few years growing up. 25F and this day just reminds me I'm still alone yet getting older as well.
