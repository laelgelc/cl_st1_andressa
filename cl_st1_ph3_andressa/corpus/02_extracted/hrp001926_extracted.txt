So uh, I'm an artist/creator, small business owner, and I've been around on the internet/social media for roughly 20 years now I guess, and I've just never made any real lasting impact anywhere, or made many friends.  
I've had to move between so many social medias so many times for so many reasons over the years. And the problem is, every time I moved, I lost friends. People didn't come with me, I lost connections, I lost friends, I lost clients/customers.  
I don't have a support network, and I have nobody to turn to anymore. 

Even if I get followers somewhere, none of them ever talk to me. If I reach out and respond to them, or make posts in clubs/community pages, I get nothing back.  
I feel invisible, I feel cursed. I feel like the universe itself hates me.

I don't know what to do. I feel alone, and that nothing I do matters, and no matter how hard I try, how much I cry, how much I scream for help, nothing changes. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so sad.
