I'm 19M. How is it possible to be trying so much yet still feel lonely so much. How are 20 percent of young adults lonely yet we are not helping each other out. How. It's been a decade of loneliness for me holy crap. I don't get it. I don't know what to do. What niche clubs am I supposed to go to lol? I feel left out anyway. What do you mean I should 'put myself out there more.' I HAVE. I TRY. Did I not try hard enough? Do people not need connection anymore? Why am I ignored all the f time. How do you do it.
