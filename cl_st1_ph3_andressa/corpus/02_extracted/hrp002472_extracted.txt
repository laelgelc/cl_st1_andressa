For context, I've been trying to meet and talk to new ppl at university after one of my closest friends moved away. We used to spend a lot of time toghether especially on weekends and at night, so it hits different. 

  
I feel like I talk to people fine, like I'm not too socially awkward, but like nothing ever comes from it. Like I can never follow up or anything, so I don't even get the chance to learn more about them.

I'm just getting tired of being lonely. I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
