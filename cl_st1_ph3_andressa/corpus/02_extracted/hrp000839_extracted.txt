I just need to get it off my chest for once, and I know it's OK. But I'm still sorry.

I'm so tired of being soft rejected. It hurts way more then just being told "no sorry I'm not interested", or it's not going to work. Some of these people I'd even be cool with just being friends with. But being strung along is making me weary of even trying anymore. 

I'm usually pretty up front and give people an out too, like "hey, I like you, but if your not feeling me it's cool". Then when I hit them up I just get crikets. I know no one owes me anything but damn, like just give me a chance. I know I can be kinda awkward but fuck. I know I'm not perfect but I'd love a reason to better myself other than just for myself. 

Last year at my best friends wedding I sat a table with all my friends and their wives/fiancée. It's just getting harder every year. I'm so touch starved and just so alone it hurts. 

No need for comments. I just needed to get it off my chest for once.
