Its all my fault, im the asshole. I now lost all my friends too and i just want to build a community where we can talk, hear people’s voices and optionally see each others faces and be friends.

Im wondering if anyone has any discord servers readily made? Or should i start one where we can build a community of friends all over the world?  

I wanna be better, seek advice, give advice, care for people and not feel alon
