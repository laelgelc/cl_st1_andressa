I live mostly off the grid in Canada. It's a humble & simple existence here in the forest. I believe that we all get lonely from time to time, especially the introverts. You have to know that you are not alone in that. What I do is to try to keep active. 

Music(making my own or listening to other's), 

Art(making my own whimsical creations & structures in the forest), 

Exercise(Inside with what I got or practical exercises in the forest), 

Nature, by observing the wildlife's whimsical footprints in the snow or the chickadee's many songs,... 

There are really many other ways to keep the loneliness from crossing over to depression. Not drinking, smoking, doing drugs, overeating, not watching sad, drama, horror or dark movies/shows or spending time on social media are just a few other ways. 

Happy thoughts :)
