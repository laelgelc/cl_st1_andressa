Hello all. How are things going? 

Someone shared on Facebook this [article](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/yale-happiness-course-wellness/index.html) saying that Yale made a course on [Happiness and Well being available for free](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being).

I'm now midway through this course. I can only say that I learned SOO much. There is so much knowledge out there, and so many things we are intuitively wrong and that we could do to feel better. 

If you have time, I definitively recommend you to take this course. It's really captivating. And if you don't have time: take it. It's absolutely worth it. 

It's too early for me to say, but I'm pretty sure that this course chances who I am on the long run.
