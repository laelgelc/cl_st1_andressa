I've been to various hackathons and start-up weekends including to work on social and health issues. I've also helped to organise such events.

While some of these were a bit stressful, I've always been impressed by the quality of the ideas that have emerged. Most of them didn't make it into reality, but some did. 

I think it would be nice to organise something on loneliness. 

Anyone interested?
