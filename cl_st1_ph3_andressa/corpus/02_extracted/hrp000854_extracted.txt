I moved to a new country about a year ago, and honestly, it’s been rough. At first, I thought I was building a friend circle, but I realized most of them are very different behind my back. That hit me harder than I expected.
I’m at the point where I actually dislike hanging out with people from my own country here, because the dynamic feels fake and draining. And now, I feel completely alone. No one I can rely on, no one I can just be myself with.
It’s started affecting me in other ways too, I can’t focus properly on my work or studies. My head feels stuck in this loop of loneliness and it’s exhausting.
It’s making me feel isolated, like I don’t belong anywhere, neither here nor back home. I don’t even know how to rebuild from this point, but I had to put it out somewhere instead of keeping it all inside.
