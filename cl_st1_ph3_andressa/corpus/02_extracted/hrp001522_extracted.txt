I live in Europe. I’m going to buy an apartment pretty soon for 200.000 euros which is very cheap considering the housing prices nowadays. I’m getting a good deal on it and it’s like 40 min from the city near the coastline, so it’s very close to the sea. The property itself is beautiful, but the surrounding houses are old or very shanty like.  It’s 90 square meters (which I don’t know how much is that in feet), but it’s considered slightly larger than most apartments here. 

I’m going to get on a mortgage by myself, of course without any help from anyone. Most people get help from their parents or their partners, so they go 50/50. I have to pay for everything by myself, so everything is more expensive for me, still I have a good job, even though no man will ever want to be with me, despite not being a gold digger.

I digress; some people have said that 90 square meters is too big for me because I don’t have a partner or children. They probably say that because they live in the city and have to pay twice the price for a shoebox apartment , while I was smarter and got something at a reasonable price within my means. I think Caleb Hammer would probably agree with me on this. It pisses me off that people say I should basically live like a sardine because I’m alone. If was a millionaire, I would get a mansion with 10 bathrooms and a tennis court and a pool if I wanted. In fact I wanted to buy a 130 square meter 3 floor house for 340.000 euros, and the reason I didn’t get it, was because it went out of my price range and it wasn’t a wise financial decision. If I had the money, I would have probably gotten it. 

Just the whole mentality that just because I’m lonely I should also be miserable when I’m home.
