Has anyone else been in a situation where they feel the need to vent by posting on this subreddit, but then back out at the last minute?

I'm a 22-year-old male. I'm reluctant to admit that I'm looking for companionship from the gender I'm attracted to (women). Why? I couldn't say exactly. I'm not really looking for sexual or romantic relationships because I know that in my current state it wouldn't be sustainable, but for some reason I crave that close connection. To have someone to talk to, and have a sincere exchange, regardless of ideological differences, a non-romantic relationship of mutual learning where humanity transcends differences.

Excuse the cheesiness, it's not usually like me to express it, but damn, I have to try opening the door a little.

Here's the comment where I insult myself by putting into words what many will think when reading me as a defensive act: I know it's a bit pathetic of me to post this, but I needed to.
