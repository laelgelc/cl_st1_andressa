I'll forever be alone. It's always like this. I'm so incredibly stupid. I'm Just something for others to use and discard. I give people what they want and in return I get nothing. I'll never be anyone's special someone. They always want more. I'll never be enough for anyone. I'm the last one on the shelf. The one nobody wanted.
