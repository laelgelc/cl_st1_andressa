But they're all I've got. My family is dysfunctional. I am truely alone. I've never mentioned not being felt included, because they'll turn and say "We care about you" maybe invite me to 1 or 2 things. Then boom back to square one. 

  
Found out about their secret vc, the one everyone else is allowed in, but me of course. I know about all their events bc they talk about them, never ask if I want in, I mention it, they'll pretend nothing was said. I exist until they dont want to deal with me.
