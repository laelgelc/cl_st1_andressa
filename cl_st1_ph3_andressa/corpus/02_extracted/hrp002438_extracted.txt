I’m the loneliest i’ve been since 2023. But this time i’m not even more aware, but also feel as if the feeling of friends was snatched from me. By 2024 i was already drifting and 2025 was the snap year to disconnect me completely from almost all peeps a few months before new years. I was getting by early 2025, the second month something great happened but, it made me realize that even with a friend nearby, i still feel lonely while not interacting directly very often. I started was getting by very well after such disappointment and further exclusion. Having no active friends by that point, a party invite or two. Drinking helped the time pass, since 2024. I loved to drunk walk on streets. Then I started on opioids and I really was passing by very well. 

By that time I was almost exclusively only in Online contact with other people, although frequent. Something happened and I quit drinking. I really miss it, really really miss it. I’d start to go study drunk at this point if I continued. I’m much less on opioids now and my most important and most personal thing which I couldn’t give up or ignore is fading away, it won’t happen at this rate. Romanticizing stuff is great until you loose it’s chance. But at the same time I feel like I never had the chance to do that dream of mine, as all opportunities seemed blocked one way or another.

I’m sober for a while, i hate it. I don’t know how to do. University is soon and I don’t even know anything anymore
