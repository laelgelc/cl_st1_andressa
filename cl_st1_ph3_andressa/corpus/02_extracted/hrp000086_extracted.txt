I was bullied throughout my childhood and teens which led to me struggling socially since. I don't think I've actually ever had a real friend. In my adulthood I have been satisfied with minimal social interaction; I haven't been totally isolated but haven't been able to maintain any sort of long term friendship, instead preferring to be on my own most of the time - without feeling lonely as a result. I was proud to be that self-sufficient in that aspect, but it has always stung me deeply that I've always been there for people who've needed emotional support in hard times, but when I've needed them and reached out, they've either dismissed me, ignored me or rejected me. All I ever wanted is some comfort and reassurance, but I have always had to get through it by myself. I just wish I didn't have to navigate my way through life alone all the time, and that I had someone looking out for me for once, someone who would listen to my problems, be a shoulder for me to cry on, or reassure me I was going to be OK and that things would get better. 
Its so hard doing it alone.
