I've noticed as I've gotten older that most people's lives tend to shape out really good or really bad with rarely in between. By really good I simply mean that they usually end up in good careers and get married and what not. And the other side you see people end up in a dark path, they end up in jail or homeless or dead at the worst after making bad choices. 

But I feel stuck in some in between, some inescapable purgatory. I didn't end up in a good career really and I've never dated anyone and I don't travel or do anything spectatular. But, I've never gone to jail or done anything bad enough to turn me into a serious social phariah. So I just kind of exist, like a grey blob that hasn't done anything succesful or really bad.
