Hello, as it says in the title im m26 and feel incredibly lonely all the time. I've never felt like I've fitted in anywhere in society. I feel like im going through the motions of life instead of actually living a life. I get up go to college and talk with everyone but I don't consider any of them friends, I feel like im the third wheel type friend. I go to work and feel the same, I try to talk and socialise with people but I feel like they talk to me not with me, I play football as well but even when I'm in a group setting I still fell left out and isolated, I've feel isolated most of the time these days, going through the motions of life, get up go to college, go to the gym, work, football and home, I honestly try to be involved but I feel like it never works, if I was to vanish for awhile would people other than my immediate family notice? Probably not the world would keep on spinning which is fine
