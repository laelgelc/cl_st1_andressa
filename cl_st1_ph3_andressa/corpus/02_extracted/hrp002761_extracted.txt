Title says it all.

I am treated differently. If you do a google search you will find many posts on this topic. It is the curse of social anxiety. 

For example, a cashier will often smile and talk to the customer in front, then ignore me when it's my turn. Ex. 2. In large social settings I find myself alone.

To make matters worse I am also an introvert, so I am quiet most of the time.

People hate it and thus hate me.

I am unemployed and have no friends.

I have come to the conclusion now that I have been screwed since birth because I am a male with social anxiety.

I have almost given up.

My therapist said and I quote "so what do you want help with?".

No one understands. No one cares. 

It's all shit.
