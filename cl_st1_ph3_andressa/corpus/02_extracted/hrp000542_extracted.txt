I have suicidal thoughts often.  I would never commit it, but I lay awake, cry myself to sleep, and think about how it would effect each person, or lack there of.  Ive heard its somewhat normal, but is it actually?  Or is everyone i know just struggling as much as I am?  I have a loving family, I just cant get ahead.  Im a mother, single, the love of my life (not childs father) after 6 years, has unresolved issues i cannot fix that affected mine and my sons life to the point my son, 17, will never approve of the relationship.  My heart is broken.  I feel like I don't deserve to be happy.  I knew a life before of fast easy money, and since trying to be a normal hard working citizen, I can not fuking win.  My head is barely above water at all times, im in my late 30s, and its shameful that my parents still need to worry about me... empathy has ruined me, and low self worth from (my child's father from a young age of 17 when he was 30, ruined me).... i just want to make one person proud. Look in the mirror and like who I see for once...
