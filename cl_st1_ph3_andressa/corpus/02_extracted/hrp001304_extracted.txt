Hi! I’m looking for a friend I can support emotionally, and who can support me too. I like listening, sharing thoughts, and encouraging others, and I’d love to connect with someone who feels the same. If you’re interested in a supportive friendship where we can talk about our day, hobbies, or just vent sometimes, send me a message!
