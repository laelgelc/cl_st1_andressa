I want to go on holidays, go and do fun things and just experience and enjoy life as so many people seem to. but I can’t and don’t want to do it alone.

I have barely any family, no partner or kids and the few friends I do have either have partners or kids and busy lives of their own. 

so I’m stuck living a dull and lonely existence most of the time, and it’s getting depressing. I have no passion, hope or motivation for anything anymore. because I don’t have anyone I really matter to. I don’t get invited to anything most of the time. I may as well not exist!
