Lonely 37 F. I feel like I should be texting friends, finding “the one” and settling into a domestic shared life filled with love and others….

Problem is, every time I am with a friend or on a date I instantly want to be by myself and have alone time - no worrying about how I look or how I come off, how or what I eat and can do what I want to do.

What is this? Is it loneliness, confusion, lack of acceptance? Where do I go from here?
