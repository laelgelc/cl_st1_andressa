Being an introvert is hard enough by itself, but the past couple years have really tested me and im starting to lose faith it will ever get any better. Just ruined the 1 friendship I had in an unfamiliar town, my kids have stopped talking to me and getting an unscheduled raise left me as an outcast at work. Just feel so lost.
