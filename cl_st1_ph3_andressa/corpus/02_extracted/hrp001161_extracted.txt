My partner, the light of my soul, went to prison for 5 months on the 16th of December. He was and still is my entire universe. We’ve been together 22 months and have lived together since a few weeks after we met. We got this flat together at the end of 2024, always just us two in our little world.

He went in on a weekend so I’ve not spoken to him since his reception call when he first arrived. I pray I will tomorrow but who knows.

Yesterday I had to take a day off work as I was too low to even leave bed, I feel closest to him there, I’m sleep with his clothes and scent all around me. Then today I went back to work, it flew by but not in a good way, because I have nothing to be excited to get home for now.

The dark, the silence, the constant feel that he’s missing is killing me. I’m sat writing him a letter and it’s breaking me in two. Laying in bed isn’t safe and cosy any more, I miss the sound of his heart under my ear when I lay on his chest. Sleep is ok cos I get to not feel for a while but when I wake up it takes me a few seconds to register he’s gone and I lose him all over again.

I feel so alone in the world, like nobody would notice now if i just faded away. If happily lay down on the ground and never get back up but I know I need to be strong and keep working etc so he’s got a home to come back to. I feel like I am trapped in hell.
