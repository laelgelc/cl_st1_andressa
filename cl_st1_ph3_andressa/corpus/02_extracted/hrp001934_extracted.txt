What shitty fucking advice. I've been acting myself, which only made me get fucking bullied when I was younger.

That's bullshit, should've just told me to try to act like others and fit in so that I don't get fucking excluded and bullied.

People love to fucking preach "everyone is different and that's good" until that someone is too different, then I'm just labelled a fucking outcast, and people will talk behind my back.

I think getting called "weird" and being picked on growing up has made me severely suppress my own personality. I don't know how to fucking act around others cause I've been suppressing myself for so long.

I feel ashamed of being myself.
