I’m starting another discord for this subreddit, dm me for the link if you’re interested in joining. This is meant to be a positive and accepting space for those of us like myself who have absolutely nobody to talk to. A simple conversation can go a long way for me personally. It lets me know that I exist if that makes sense. All I ask is that you are respectful, open to receiving. This is not meant to overwhelm. If you find a single person that you feel comfortable chatting with then that’s fine. Everyone is welcome but certain things will not be tolerated. You are free to express yourself, but I will not tolerate hate speech. This is not a place to spew political propaganda or insults. Connect with someone or at least make the attempt and let’s try to support each other in our day to day.
