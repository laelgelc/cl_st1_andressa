I would have never thought of me coming to Reddit to write this but here we are

I want to tell you a little about my story and see if you can answer some of my questions

I had lived in different countries and experienced different things

For example why I was living in london I felt true isolation

I was just going to work and then back home alone 

After some time living there I enjoyed being by myself, perhaps because I was busy and with an objective

Now I’m back in my home country

The 1 year here was difficult as all my friends had moved somewhere else

After 1 year I joined a new friend group and while I was really happy after sometime I noticed that I moved completely the focus from me to getting validation from them

Now I’m trying to be just me; spend more time alone without chasing people and is working

However sometimes I feel lonely, like I’m not important if no one is trying to reach out to me to go out

It’s weird because that’s something that would have never crossed my mind a couple of years ago 

I want to understand how can it be fine to be alone and not lonely in a society based on communities 

Thank you for your attention, is an important moment of growth for me
