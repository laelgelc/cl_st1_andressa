I’m m21 and in college whenever I see the beautiful girl in campus I just like have a quick glance like oh she’s beautiful then lower my gaze, but let a girl have a convo with me and next thing I know I’m imagining my life with her takes weeks for me to calm my self down and convince my self it’s not happening. Had a final exam today 2hr text I took 1:30 so I left tired with a headache hopeful I did good have to wait for everyone to finish to get the results anyways as I’m walking to the dining hall singing softly I glanced at a girl by the reception (they usually do tours for people interested in joining) so I’m oh she’s cute then lower my sight but as I walk by she stood up excuse me u study here how is it and all and I notice she is sooo gorgeous so now I’m in “love” I have a headache heart racing every emotion at once lmao she kept asking I think I gave awkward answers but I’m tired couldn’t think properly. I have this crush on a classmate (if y’all want details let me know) but if I had a choice I would pick new girl all day. I basically really wish I convinced her to join would love to see her again if y’all got any tips for being alone or finding someone I would be happy to listen.
