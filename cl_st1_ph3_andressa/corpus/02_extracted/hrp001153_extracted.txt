For the past few days, I’ve been having a hard time sleeping. It feels like there’s a void, and nothing seems to be filling it. I’ve been grinding for so long, yet I feel stuck. I have no money, no social life, no love life—just following the same exhausting routine every damn day.I wanna cry so badly yet I can't bring myself to do it. Can anyone reach out to me, I really have no one.
