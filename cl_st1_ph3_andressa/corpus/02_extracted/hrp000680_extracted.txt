Hi!!

I’m 18F and offering friendly, SFW online companionship, basically someone to talk to, hang out with virtually, or keep you company while you work, study or unwind.

This is strictly platonic, no flirting, no NSFW, no weird stuff. Just genuine conversation and a comfortable vibe.

I’m open to things like:
	•Chatting about life, hobbies, or daily stuff
	•Watching shows or movies online together
	•Keeping company during work or study sessions
	•Light texting throughout the day (optional)

I’m friendly, a good listener, and easy to talk to. If you’ve had a long day, need motivation, or just want a nice conversation, I’ve got you.

Rate: Open to negotiation, we can agree on something fair.
Platform: Discord, Reddit chat, or any safe app you prefer
Payment method: PayPal

Comment or DM me if interested 

Edit / Update:
Just to clarify, I’m offering friendly, non-romantic, non-sexual online companionship. I’m not looking to pay anyone for it. This is meant to be a safe-for-work, platonic chat or hangout service for people who’d like someone to talk to online.
