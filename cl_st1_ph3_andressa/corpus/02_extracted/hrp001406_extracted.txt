my brother and i are pretty close. i’m coming back home from a trip and my brother agreed that he would pick me up when i came back home. this was a couple months ago but ig he forgot about the date and made vacation plans with his significant other, so he can’t pick me up anymore. i am fully aware that my brother is under no obligation to pick me up at the airport, but it just really hurts especially when no other family member or friend is available to help pick me up.

we’ve been growing apart ever since he found a new job and got a new partner. bc he’s so busy, i don’t really get the chance to talk to him and feel like i’m being increasingly unprioritized in his life. he takes around a week to get to my texts bc he’s a bad texter, but i also know for a fact that he’s really good at responding to his partner. i understand that there’s different relationship dynamics but whenever i think about it, it makes me sad.

i don’t want to confront him about it because he lived a life with the burden of taking care of me as the oldest child in the family. i’m glad that he’s started a new life but i just feel really lonely and empty, especially when he was the person i considered to be the closest to all my life. how do i deal with these feelings of loneliness?
