19M and my life was on the up and now it’s on a massive down again. My friends are seeing me less and less and my gf broke up with me about a month ago so I’m desperate for some interaction with people. 

It feels like I’m cursed to feel like this forever, idk how I managed to get out of it last time but I did.
