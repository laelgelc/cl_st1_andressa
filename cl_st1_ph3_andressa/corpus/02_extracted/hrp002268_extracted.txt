Life fucking sucks when you don’t have someone to talk to, even about the little things. I wish I had someone I could tell the little wins or little mess ups to throughout the day. Feel like i’m going crazy with my thoughts, it’s sad how much I yearn for the slightest bit of companionship. What’s wrong with me. I just want people around who care.
