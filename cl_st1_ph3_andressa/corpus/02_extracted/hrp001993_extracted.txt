I’m 23, in university and working, and most people around me socialise, party, drink and smoke. I’m genuinely happy for them, but I’ve never really been into that lifestyle. I didn’t grow up having friends or relationships. I grew up in a horrendous environment as a child, and once I understood what was happening, I decided to enlist in the RAF, mainly to run away from the SA. 

When I 18 I was deployed for a couple of months to Afghanistan for aid.

After leaving the military and coming to university, I’ve felt very lonely. People often come to me for advice, they think I’m yoda or something . I do have a best  friend he’s an ex Afghan soldier who served with me, he’s honestly a sweet heart, the best protector and stuff, only issue is our language and cultural barrier is a challenge especially  as I’m not a bloke too. 

I’ll be honest: in some ways, I preferred being deployed to being here. Afghanistan situation was horrible situation, but the people I was around felt surreal,, and easier to relate to it didn’t  matter where u came from, here I struggle to relate to anyone, it really did feel like I have a purpose. 

On the surface I probably seem boring. I have fairly normal interests  football, the gym, investing but my past has  made me see the world with rose tinted glasses.
