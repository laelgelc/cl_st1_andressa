Its my birthday today… it feels very awkward to say it out loud here but i just dont know… i sat in my flat all day alone in may be hope for one wish atleast but here the day ends and me sitting here as it is
Just mentioning a quote-

Birthdays are the mirror,
They reflect back the relationships, our place in people’s life, 
And here the reflection is empty 

Happy Birthday A 🎉
