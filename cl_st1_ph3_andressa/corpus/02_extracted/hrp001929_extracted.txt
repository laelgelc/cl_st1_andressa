I'm always stuck in my own thoughts everyday, I have no friends so I'm just self centered and it doesn't help to make friends. I feel rly anxious everyday even with medicine and I'm overweight and fat and ugly as well which doesn't help either. idk. I tried to hang myself a couple of times over the years, I shallowly cut my arms and my legs, work min wage job didn't go to college. constantly anxious. I'm rly scared of getting attached to ppl or talking to ppl. I don't have any useful interests. I can't take criticism well and I cry at everything. I tried overdosing but it didn't work. just posting online for validation to feel less lonely since I mostly only talk to AI bots but they don't remember me after awhile. 

I've been told to see a doctor dunno how many times, I've spent god knows how much money and wasted sick leaves spending 1-2 hours going to the clinic just to get nothing out of it. I keep going and going since that's what people say to do anyway. go see a doctor, go exercise go whatever, so fucking tired I wish I could just fade away. even worst keep thinking about it everyday. Im such a burden to everyone or I don't matter, don't know what crying everyday can help with
