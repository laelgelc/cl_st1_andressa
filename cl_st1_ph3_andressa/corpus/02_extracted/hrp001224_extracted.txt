I have hobbies, a side hustle, and keep myself busy with my studies. But when im not busy with these things, i feel empty. I feel so lonely. I crave for some kind of emotional connection with someone.

I have friends but i never open up with them. I have trust issues. I listen to their rants, vents, and their random stories and thoughts but im having a hard time doing the same for them. Maybe because i know they wouldnt understand me and i live a double life. I keep a lot of secrets because of my strict religion. And growing up, i was constantly shamed for almost everything i do.

I hate that i feel such a complex person. I wish i was normal.

Ever since I had my first heartbreak, i have a hard time being alone. I always crave to be loved. Im always talking to some guy and usually it doesnt last. I had 2 boyfriends within 3 years and each lasted only for a year. I'm probably addicted to male attention atp.

(And also, im not allowed to have a bf lol.)

Im probably addicted because guys are so good at pretending to care which i really crave for. At least i got a safe space to overshare my life TEMPORARILY. If it doesnt work out I can just find someone else to talk to who can occupy the void in me and repeat.

Ive given up on dating genuinely as well, with all the dating rules on social media like "dont double text", "dont show too much affection, theyll lose attraction" etc. Idek if genuine love is possible these days. But if love does exist, i dont think i'll ever experience it.

I dont want advice or anything, i just wanna let feelings out.
