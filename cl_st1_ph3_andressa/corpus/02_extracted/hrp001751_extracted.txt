I have zero drive to socialise left in me. Half way into my second year of university and I've made zero connections, haven't joined any societies, never talked to a professor, never been to any event and still haven't been to parts of the campus out of fear. So I haven't had any new experiences. If it weren't for family I would be completely alone.
