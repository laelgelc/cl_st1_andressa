Hi,

I'm a 24-year-old Italian guy and for a very long time I've been feeling extremely isolated. Around almost everyone I just… don't feel like myself.

I've been trapped for years in my own head — stuck in thought patterns and perspectives that kept me from taking any real action. I've worked on countless things to try to become a more functional human being and slowly I'm starting to see progress.

One thing has become really clear to me lately:

being around people — even when it's uncomfortable — is still much better than staying completely alone.

Right now, being with others drains me a lot. I have to force myself heavily to adapt, to mask, to fit in. Yet I'm convinced that, in the long run, it's worth it for my mental health. My plan is to keep doing this for a while: build up some energy and vitality again… so that later I can have the strength to walk into new environments, meet new people and — hopefully — finally find the ones I can really connect with.

To make this work I know I have to put my ego aside (extremely hard for me).

I also know I must never let die the quiet hope that people more similar to me actually exist out there.

A big part of the problem is that my current view of people is still shaped by painful past experiences — they left me deeply afraid of others. I'm trying really hard to change that lens.

I'm not even super lucid while writing this, but the simple fact that I'm able to write these words at all is already a huge step forward for me. Until very recently I wouldn't have been able to express any of this.

So yeah… I think things are slowly, slowly moving in a better direction.
