Sometimes I just want to vent about my needs, my desires, with likeminded adults who won’t judge me, because I’m hurting immensely but my intimate life often ties closely with my romantic life and this subreddit doesn’t always feel like the most appropriate place to talk about those things. I don’t know if I’m wrong in thinking this, or if there is a sub for such vents but please lmk either way, thank you.
