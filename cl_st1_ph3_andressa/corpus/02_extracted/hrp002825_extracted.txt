All,

I've just finished my first interview with Anne (not her real name).  Her story is profound.  We talked about many things, including the loneliness that has lingered throughout her life.  She's an amazing person with an amazing story to tell.

Perhaps we could add these interviews to a section of the website called "stories"?  

Feedback welcome!
