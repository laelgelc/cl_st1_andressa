I was released from hospital yesterday morning for a weekend pass. Basically I needed to be back on the ward by Monday early evening. It was the first time I was allowed out of the ward longer then a afternoon since the 2nd of December.  I was going to spend the time unpacking and sorting my new bed sit. I didn't account for the lack of noise. And total loneliness I felt. 
I tried putting on some music and shows on my tablet to break the feeling but it didn't work. And I started to spiral. Found something that triggered my PTSD and dropped a picture frame. Ended up in AnE before getting sent back to the ward. Even now, I feel so alone. How do people deal with crushing lonelyness? I don't have any family near me having moved the length of the country just over a year ago.

Sorry for the long post.
