Where do you guys find people to talk to? I'm trying to work on my social skills and social anxiety by trying to get out of my shell more but I just don't know where to start in talking to people.

I was thinking that the safest way would probably be online but I really don't have a clue where to look or find people.

Not to mention that in real life it is 100 times harder because people would just get annoyed or ask what the hell you want? Or maybe I just got unlucky with people I don't know 😕.

Would really like to hear some suggestions/advice if you guys have one.

Thank you in advance!
