Suicidal history has my family treat me like a caged animal where they are flung into panic if I take 10 steps away from the house despite me being an adult.

The world sees timid men like me as ticking time bombs for mass murder or r\*pe, I don’t even help escape that stereotype because I also cling to fictional characters like a lifeline and am hated by almost every single person who got to know me.

Some days I can take it but today I just can’t, I feel like I wanna curl up inside a shell and not do anything until I feel safe again. I wish I was a isolated little bug in the woods somewhere where my soul actually is fit to function.
