Other than to just disintegrate off the face of this earth. I want people or a person to talk to. To interact and have some human connection and not just “hey how are you” and then nothing. I feel lonely all through out my life. I didn’t have friends growing up but I tried really hard and just no one liked me. I’m tired of making friends and losing them just cause life changes. My life has changed so much and I never stopped putting in effort. I’m just ready to not be here cause what’s really the point? No one likes me, I have hardly any family that cares. I message people all the time and get no damn response, why did you even make the post? Idk. Just tired of existing if it means being alone
