To briefly summarize last Saturday's online hangout: 

* **Organisation:** While keeping in mind the idea of an action oriented hackathon, we feel like it would be good to set up some kind of an organisation in the background. Not something centralised and top down, but rather distributed. 
* **Input:** we see potential if we go to talk to experts in the field, e.g. academics/practitioners/authors. Insurances may also be interested in the topic. But talking to non-experts concerned by  loneliness is an important topic.
* **Explicite/implicit**: Question that came up: Should we rather focus on a positive wording (e.g. "purpose") or actually talk about "loneliness". There are many meetups/organisations that are organised with the purpose to bring people out of loneliness, where that topic is never intentionally and explicitly brought up. There seems to be a consensus that we should explicitly mention "loneliness" but in combination with positive wordings, in particular "purpose". 
**New people**: It's good to see that since we started, we had practically each time a new person joining in. 

Next steps: 

* **Google drive.** Already set up,
* **Website:** Basic website is ready. Content under heavy work though (text now on shared google drive. 
* **Exploration:** Continue exploring / talk to people to get feedback and input and integrate insights into document now on google drive.

**Next meetup: Saturday, May 12th, usual time. 11am CDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST. Note: Many of us seem to be absent. So likely only few people will be there.
