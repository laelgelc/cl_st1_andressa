So I have a torn calf muscle and I can’t walk. I asked my mom to come back home to help me but she decided to go fly to Utah to help her friend give up her dog? Anyways she gave me the whole, “if I could only get a refund on my plane ticket you know I would be there for you. I just got it this morning”. I told her there was a 24 hour cancellation policy and she said she would check on it. Anyway, I rescheduled my appointment with the orthopedist because she said she would be back on the 7th. I found out that she left Utah early and has been hanging out with my brother the whole time. Like. She lied to me, like I don’t matter. I’m so hurt and alone right now. I really need a hug.
