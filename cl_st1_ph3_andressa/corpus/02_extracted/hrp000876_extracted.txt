i brought you home 13 years ago today, a week before my 27 birthday you were my birthday present to myself. I was in extreme low point and depression in life. Alone, dark thoughts, addiction and you helped pulled me out of it. you gave me reason, friendship, and a purpose. For the next 13 years you stood by my side, together we traveled, got married, buried our closest friends, a son and in the end - divorce. buried,dead, and gone. it was just  you and i against the world... its been 8 months since i had to say goodbye, you helped me heal through so much man. so now i sit, 1 week till my birthday .. alone again.right back where i started

i miss your smile so much

sorry if it written jumbled mess.. just letting my mind pour out..
