It hits so hard to know that at low moments when you need to talk the most, there is not a single person you could reach out! Not even my twin. 

I could disappear and no one would notice, really! My mom doesn’t call anymore, my best friend never picks up the phone or responds to my 30+ unread messages including an « I love you » message. 

It feels so lonely that I have been fighting this situation by learning all the likeable skills there are, like cooking exceptionally, especially for others (at heart I am anorexia and a lot of them don’t notice that I don’t eat much when I organize dinners) 

It hurts so much that I have such a wide circle of people, yet at moments like this, each are enmeshed in their little affectionate bubbles of family or couples. 

I live in a village far away, so that makes it even worse to know that if I literally move across the country, I would be just invisible to them.
