I have had friends in my life and I have been a loner in my life. And let me tell you, being a loner is the most difficult expiernece to face. It makes you braver. You build a core. Even though you may feel like a loser by your self sitting there eating out or at the beach or shopping , you get to have an experience for yourself . No influences to sway you. No stupid talk. No one to impress. Just your own thoughts and descions. And it is so brave, to be a loner. It’s comfortable to be with friends. It’s comfortable to be lost in a crowd of people that may or may not care for you. But when your alone in your own skin. Omg , wow. Truly, loners don’t get enough credit for being .
