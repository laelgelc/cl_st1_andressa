Some days feel alright, and some days get so heavy. Some days I'm completely fine being alone without someone, and I feel good to be alone. But some days I find myself searching for a person. Social anxiety is such a curse. I cannot talk to people. Girls, mostly. Dating app's no good either. 

I try to throw these bad feelings away through work, gym and my hobbies, but at the end of the day, it feels so empty. 

I wonder what my life's going to be like. As I go on.
