I can imagine not having many people in your life makes the scheduling less stressful, maybe less susceptible to empathy fatigue, don't have to worry about missing holidays etc.

But I also hear that these kinds of emotional careers often take a toll on your mental health, which can be made worse if you do not have a solid network whether on duty/ off duty etc. What do you think?
