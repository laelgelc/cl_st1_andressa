If you need a hug right now here is a big one :)

I hope this can help you feel a little better whatever you are going through.

This is something I wish someone had told me before so Im saying it now. Please dont forget how strong you are, way stronger than you think, even on the days where everything feels heavy.

If you are someone who feels things very deeply I get you because I feel that way too and sometimes it is exhausting to feel so much in a world like ours and not always be understood.

But knowing you are here reading this really helps me too. Whoever you are wherever you are I am holding you in a biiig hug.

Let’s keep going for those moments of happiness !

ps : if I made mistakes I’m sorry, I’m french ;-;
