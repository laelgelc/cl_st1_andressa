Every day is the same routine I go to work where i speak to about the same 2 or 3 people and then I go gym where i speak to no one. I’ve only got like 2 friends left and I only see one rarely and even then all we do is get drunk and walk around our shithole town at 3am and that is considered a fufilling weekend these days. Like a year ago I had so much more going on but ever since i turned 18 its literally like I’ve just been replaying the same day over and over again.
