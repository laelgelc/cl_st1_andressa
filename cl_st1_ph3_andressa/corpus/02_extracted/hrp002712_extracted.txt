Just seeing a lot of posts here about feeling lonely or wanting to be friends, or, *gasp*, actually loving their family... So been wondering, anyone actually, you know, really got rid of all humans from their life so they can happily live alone?

For me it's kinda practical, I don't understand humans, humans don't understand me, so close connection is impossible anyway (tried that in the past). I cooperate and discuss things if practical of course, but that's it. 

If you are an actual loner, how does your life look like? Humans might be annoying, but they can be obviously useful, so I'm wondering, how do you balance this obvious trade-off between avoiding them, while still enjoying conveniences of civilization?
