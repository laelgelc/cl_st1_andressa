At least that's what I got as an answer when I asked the question on [/r/Foreveralone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/8e5h2s/whats_the_one_thing_that_you_think_we_should_do/). 

I've also read a book about loneliness a long time ago, that came to the conclusion that a "transcendent meaning" in live is one of the most important things we need to not feeling alone.

Question would then be what we can do to give meaning and purpose to people.
