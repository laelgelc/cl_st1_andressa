I was broken up with a few weeks ago and haven't moved on. But I feel so lonely right now. I still miss my ex but that's something I won't be returning to. I just want to deal with my loneliness without involving my ex. I've tried many methods: making more friends, talking about my experience with others, hanging out with friends. But none of it worked. This hole of loneliness seems like
like it can't be filled by being with my friends. And lately, I've been so tempted to talk to other girls. Idk whats up with it, but I feel like talking to other girls is the only way to fill my loneliness (though im not really sure). I just get so excited, confident, and happy while doing so. I haven't done it a lot of times though because whenever I spoke to a girl and asked for their contact, I would never actually text them. So I dont really know if this will really fill my hunger for companionship. If anyone can help, please give advice.
