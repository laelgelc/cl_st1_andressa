Everyone hates loneliness from people i know but i relish in it. Can't make deep connections? Don't want them people have done nothing but either laugh with me or at me and in my life for like a week. People say I'm too much sometimes so fuck them i wont give them the satisfaction of being around me. People crave affection and attention? save up money for a sex worker problem solved. My family? They always say communication is a two way street but make me be the one to initiate all the time. Loneliness has been around me all my life and finally I'm okay with it. I am who i am and i love who i am I'm done trying to please people I'm going to do shit for me
