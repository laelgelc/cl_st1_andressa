I’m 23 years old. I just started my undergraduate in college, but prior to I was in community college. I do have a partner and I have friends; but the consistency at which my friends talk to me is not great. I feel like I’m always the one who is reaching out. And I just end up getting ghosted.

I also don’t understand people who say they want to do certain things with me, I reach back out and try to make plans, and I just end up getting ghosted. 

I go to clubs at my university and I volunteer, I’ll talk to people and get their numbers. I reach out and try to get to know them better. Ghosted.

Does anyone else struggle with this problem? It’s exhausting. I just want to give up.
