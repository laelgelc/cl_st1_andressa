Ever since I knew myself, I've always been alone. No body close, no lovers, no bestie, no friends. Always alone. If I ever get in a group I always get excluded. I tried everything in the book to make friends but I know I won't get any. 

It feels awful when you know that no one would show up at your funeral when you died, finding out that your parents never loved you, they were just there because it was their job. It hurts knowing that you'll never experience love or marriage. It hurts everytime you walk into a room everyone looks at you as if your some kind of alien. It hurts when everyone chooses to talk to your friends instead of you. It hurts whenever someone needs to talk to you or ask you something they need to talk to you through someone else. For example the other day my mom is talking to someone and I'm just standing beside her. The person asks my mom what my name is and I'm literally standing right there.

I just reached to the point where I'm just fed up and is literally preparing myself for my lonely life when I finish school.
