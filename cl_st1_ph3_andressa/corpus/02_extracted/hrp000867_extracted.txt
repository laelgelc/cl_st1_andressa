They all say I'm so kind and fun to be around 

Until I'm sick again

They all say they love my company and conversations

Until I check into the hospital

They all say I'm such a good friend and are so grateful to have me in their life

Until I'm coughing up blood again

They all say they love me and cherish our relationship 

Until it's been 3 days and I'm too weak to get out of bed

They all say they'll stand by me no matter what

Until I ask them to call 911 for me

Words are meaningless and their actions are devastating. Silently they exit stage left and I am left to pick up the script. I am not dying, but to them I am already dead. I bandage my wounds and touchup my mask, preparing for the next show to begin. 

They all walk away. And I am left in the spotlight. Alone.
