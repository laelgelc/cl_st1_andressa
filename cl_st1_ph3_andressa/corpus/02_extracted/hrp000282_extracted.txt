I just found myself online looking for a therapist  again, knowing damn well that therapy does not work for me. This realization took many many years of different therapists. It has left me with a ton of therapy trauma, heartbreak, disappointment and anger.

I realize now that what I really want is not a therapist but a human being that will listen to me and care. Unfortunately, what I have received is therapist who cannot fathom what I have been through. 

Therapist, counselor's social workers, caseworkers, that's what I grew up with. That's all I know. I suppose that is why I continuously and automatically return to it, even though it does not meet my needs.

It's genuine human kindness that I truly long for. It gives me hope in humanity. Without any connections to others, I find myself feeling so horrible. I cry every single day, intermittently for periods of time. I cannot make it stop. 

Also, need to add that psych meds are not the answer. Not for the long-term and not for me.
