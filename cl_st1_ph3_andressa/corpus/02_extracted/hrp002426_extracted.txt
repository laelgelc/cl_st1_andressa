I just got out of my first ever relationship about a year ago (“dated” for two years), if you could even call it a relationship, she never actually loved me turns out, long story.

So lately I’ve been trying to get back out into the dating world, I want a real actual connection, I want a girl who is loving and who cares. I’m really lonely and im getting my career in welding started finally, but it’s really hard for me to meet people because I really don’t have any friends that I can be around to find places to meet people.
