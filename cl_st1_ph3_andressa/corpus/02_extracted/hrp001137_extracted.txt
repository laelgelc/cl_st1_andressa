FIRST OFF: I WAS NOT EAVESDROPPING. 

Instead, I was simply minding my own business in my room, when all of a sudden the sound of the couple, who share another room in my house, having sex became loud enough for me to hear in my own space. The girl sounded like she enjoyed it quite a lot. I've no interest in being bitter about them, but I just feel very sad in contrast. They're happily married, loving each other very much (corroborated by what I've just experienced), and supporting each other through life's undulations, whereas I'm just a miserable faliure who's struggling to work on a job application that will likely turn me down, has no partners ever in my life and thus no sexual experiences, and probably will never have one in the future. All I have is a lifeless plushie who's with me all day long (he's cute ngl, but I wish I can have someone *real* who's as cute). They had a nice time to themselves, when I just suddenly got very depressed and cried in my bed. End of.
