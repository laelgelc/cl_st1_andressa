Hey I'm 23 and currently unemployed.... I am at my home and I feel loneliness at its peak. After new year, I started thinking about my friends and people. I felt that I'm the person who always put efforts and I thought I might be wrong. Guess what? I am not talking to my so called best friends and people. I feel bad and kinda suicidal.

I am comfortable to talk to strangers and love that since there would be any judgement and I hope I'll find someone here too....
