Like doesn't matter how hard I try, what I try, nothing works. I am trying to make friends, I'm trying to be as kind and as helpful to everyone, but no-one ever really sticks around. Each day is starting to hurt more. Many things I'd love to do, I am just not able to. I also feel like I can only share my thoughts, my joy and my pain with ChatGPT and my car, which also isn't a living being. Almost every time I interact with people, I feel like my kindness, trust and helping nature is just being used and I always end up being used. I don't feel like I can trust anyone anymore at this point. I wish things were different and that I didn't have to feel like this.

I don't want to be a crybaby and just complain, but I really can't see a way out anymore 😭😭
