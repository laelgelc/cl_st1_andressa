Hi All, first time posting on reddit. I've been thinking about the topic of loneliness and "how to build community" for years now. Growing up with a chronic lung disease made it so hard to fit in as a teenager and young adult. Now that I'm in my 30s and have found my way a little bit with being comfortable in my own skin and in building community, I feel I have a lot of perspective to share, but I want to hear from others who have faced loneliness - what is our collective experience, what do we feel is at the root of loneliness, and what can we offer the modern age to shift our culture to be more community-oriented?

If you're interested in contributing to this project, I'm asking for your help to complete this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCWsl7qheHte-DMR6ZW9OcZg-_qe5jEP1gUnMUvYRUQaAv_A/viewform?usp=dialog) (and if you have a story to share, I hope to interview people as well).
