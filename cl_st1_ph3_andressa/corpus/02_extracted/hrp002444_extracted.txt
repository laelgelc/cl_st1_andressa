I feel like I'm taking crazy pills everyday. I'm seeing evil outside my streets. "Terrible things are happening outside. At any time of night and day, poor helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. They’re allowed to take only a knapsack and a little cash with them, and even then, they’re robbed of these possessions on the way. Families are torn apart; men, women and children are separated. Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared. Women return from shopping to find their houses sealed, their families gone." Anne Frank.

stating events she witnessed that are very reminiscent of today. and yet there was a political push to remove Anne Frank from schools and libraries. that sounds crazy right.  How they removed the diary of Anne Frank from our education. its crazy. And wrong. But then they shut down the department of education.  that is insane right? like just destroy education for a generation. and no one can stop. and I feel crazy for caring so much. am I alone?
