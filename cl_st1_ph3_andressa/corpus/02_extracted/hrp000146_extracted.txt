Hi I feel very lonely and have social anxiety. Just want someone I can feel comfortable enough with to have deep talk with (or just talk about daily life) and play games (I don't have a lot of coop games but i have minecraft and elden ring). Discord: yuyuna8903

I'm an Asian from Canada so preferably someone in similar timezone. I like drawing and anime, and spend most of my time watching youtube and doing school stuff. I have a small youtube channel where I post my drawing process.
