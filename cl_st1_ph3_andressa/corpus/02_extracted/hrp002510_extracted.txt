Ive (30F) been going through it for a little while. Where do you put your sadness when the person you considered your best friend just abandons you like it was nothing? When they post online about their pain but won't talk to you. I think thats the part that shocks the system. Maybe if we could have some kind of resolution and part ways on good terms it would feel OK. 
We were both wrong but it feels Im the only one who takes accountability. And Im left with silence. Theres so much hurt and it has no where to go now that the person who was the comfort is the cause. I hate being negative, generally feeling that life happens the way it should. 
The nights are so quiet. Ive been using it to find some new good music. The songs "The Mountain Is You," "Rivers and Roads" and "Exile" have been getting me through. Can you guys suggest other soft songs to pair well with the absolute heartbroken wreck ive been--something to give me hope. Or make me cry harder. Im here for it all.
