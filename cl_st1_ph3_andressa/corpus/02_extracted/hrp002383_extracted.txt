I am 20 now and I thought I would get better but it never did. Even now its like a fail to realize things are actually happening. Throughout my life I’ve never really been "alone", since I was always in a friend group and had a couple close friends which am still friends with. I like to think I went through everything normally but I don’t feel like I did. I feel like I truly was never there, like nobody really understands me. Like everyday is just a loop that resets every morning. I don’t understand why I’ve felt alone all my life when I have friends and a loving family. I have never spoken about this to anyone and I wanted to know if I was alone in this boat.
