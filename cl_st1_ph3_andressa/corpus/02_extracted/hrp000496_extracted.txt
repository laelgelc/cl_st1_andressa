I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no friends or family, never really had but a few weeks ago my only friend has abandoned me and I’m in an awful situation overall, losing my apartment very soon as well and also my cats. I just don’t know what to do i have no one to turn to and honestly i just don’t want to anymore. With the new year coming up very soon it just feels like… the end.
