If I could move to an island and be all by myself I would. I would build a structure in a tree and use the resources around me to live. I would bring many books. I would also bring things to draw with and on. Life would be simple. Just me, my books, and I. I cant live with out music so I would want a piano and a guitar as well. I would at some point get electricity on the island with some sort of water system. My island would have many crops such as but not limited to: corn, beans, cabbage, watermelon, cantaloupe and more. I was raised in a small crop house. We had many a plant to help us along. I would also be sure to have many chickens, goats, cows, and such. But ultimately I would eat sushi a lot! I love making it and it’s worth the effort it takes for sure. I would probably have monthly shipments as well. I think clearer when I am alone. I feel safer when I am not led to temptation in the surroundings of my peers. Life could be simple.
