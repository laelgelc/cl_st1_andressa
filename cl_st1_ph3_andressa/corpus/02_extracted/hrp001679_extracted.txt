im only 19 but i feel so alone nowadays. i dont have many friends and i miss my ex so bad it physically hurts. he left me 7 months ago and i think he already has a new gf. idk tho but i just wish i had someone to be there for me.

i want love. why can't i ever get it? i feel like my source of happiness is in other peoples hands. when im alone, its just another day. when im with someone, its an eventful day. i wish i had someone. anyone. ive been alone for so long. i wish someone out there cared about me.
