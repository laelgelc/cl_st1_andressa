I wish I just could've been alone forever. Holding her hand, feeling her heat and mine come together until I can't feel the difference anymore is all I think about. It's been a year. I'll never really know what a human being feels like, no matter how bad I want to I'll never get another chance. 
We evolved for billions of years to pair bond and fuck and I live with billions of other humans on this rock who would rather be doing something else.
 If the people who love me understood how I feel and how I will always feel they would beat me to death with hammers instead of insisting I stay alive. 
I want to be a normal human and not be so worthless and awful. 
I hope when I get the courage to commit suicide I don't fail that like I do everything else, but I probably will
