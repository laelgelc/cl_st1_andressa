Just found this subreddit last night and I love it. I was always the ¨odd ball out¨ in all my friend groups, but as I´ve gotten older I´ve come to terms with it. There´s no need to go out and find my tribe when I´ve already had a tribe all along, and it´s within me. 

I hope you´re all doing well :)
