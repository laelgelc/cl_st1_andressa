this is a very legitimate question living in my head rent free for months now. 

I’m an immigrant in the UK. my husband is British but he is not a social butterfly. we both see our parents as our best friends, and we’re each other’s best friends too. I also have a cat, who I can spend my whole time with.

so I don’t really feel the need to make friends. 

but I also know that I yearn for connections. I love talking to people. I love being around people. I do wish I had someone that I could grab a coffee every weekend, go to a clay course together, or more - things that I cannot do with my husband, my cat, or my family.

still, I’m very happy with my current situation.

is this weird? do I have to have friends?
