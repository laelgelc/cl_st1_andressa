Lately I’ve been thinking… maybe being alone isn’t that bad. At least it’s peaceful.But then a second thought pops in my mind What if there's noone other than my family left to talk at all in this whole world? 
I keep showing up for people, checking on them, trying to be the one who cares ... BUT when I’m the one feeling low, it’s just quiet. No one even notices.No texts, no calls. Nothing. Just me and my foggy mind.
It hurts when you realize you’re the only one who genuinely tries. Makes you question everything ...Are they even friends, or just people you talk to out of habit? A habit of 6-7 years?
But then again, the idea of being completely alone is scary too. Like, what if one day there’s no one left to talk to at all?
So what do you guys do? Do you choose peace and stay alone, or keep holding on just because the silence feels heavier than the company? 
And if you choose to stay alone... 
The silence hits hard sometimes. 
So, how do you deal with that constant heaviness? How do you keep yourself from breaking down every time it gets too quiet?
