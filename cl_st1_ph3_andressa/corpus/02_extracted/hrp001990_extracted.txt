I know it’s unhealthy and I need help but I swear feeling lonely and sad feels great sometimes. Does anyone else get the shiver down their body? (Mine is in my sides usually)

Sometimes I think about being lonely. How I’m 22 and I’ve yet to find love, and how I don’t think I will. There are other issues in my life but love has always been the biggest struggle for me. And sometimes I think about it so much that I can physically feel the sadness. Am I addicted to it? I don’t really think so, but I’d be lying if I said I was avoiding fixing myself. It’s like I don’t want to put in the effort of finding love the hard way. I tell myself certain things to keep myself here because all my life I’ve just been the outcast. In every way. In more ways than just love. I know it can’t iust be me.

Also… a side tangent for anyone who cares. I know 22 is still young but for me it’s not. Im not just single… I’ve also never had a relationship. The pain of seeing everyone around you find and fall out of love is a lot to bear. I wish I could have breakups, I wish I had young love, I wish I could have experiences. But the fact that no one even gives me the chance to fuck up in the first place just makes me feel terrible. And it’s been so long now that I’m sitting here writing this, for no apparent reason. I’m not the only one who feels like this, I know it. Honestly I just thought it’d be neat to see what other people feel. We may not be so different.
