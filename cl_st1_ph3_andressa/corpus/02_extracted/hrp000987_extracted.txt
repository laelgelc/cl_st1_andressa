I should’ve trusted my gut.

It started with little things—him turning his phone over whenever I was near, taking longer showers, and saying he was "just tired" every time I wanted to talk or cuddle. At first, I blamed myself. Maybe I was too clingy. Maybe I was imagining things.

Then one night, he said he was going out with his "cousin"—some guy I'd never heard of before. I stayed home, scrolling aimlessly on my phone, when a friend sent me a blurry photo from across town. It was him. At a bar. But he wasn’t alone. He was with a girl I recognized—someone he once told me was “just a coworker.”

They weren’t acting like coworkers.

Her hand was on his leg. He was laughing like he used to laugh with me. My heart dropped. I stared at the screen for what felt like hours before the tears even came.

When he came home, I didn’t say anything. I just looked at him and asked, “Did you have fun?” He smiled and said, “Yeah, just caught up with my cousin.”

That’s when I knew—he wasn’t just lying to me. He was comfortable with it.

And that hurt more than anything.
