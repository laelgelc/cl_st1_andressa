I think almost all people have experienced moments of loneliness at least once in their lives, mostly lasting a few months, maybe a year, or a couple of years.

Since I stopped having friends, about 9 years ago, I haven't found a single one.
Now, at 23, I find myself spending another New Year's Eve alone for almost a decade and wondering what I did wrong.

Was I wrong not to adapt?
Was I wrong to want things to happen naturally without forcing them?
Was I wrong to renounce some experiences in order to respect my principles?

Is it really just a matter of luck? I come from a small village in rural Italy. I thought I had fewer opportunities than those who live in big cities, yet even here those few people manage to connect.

I know I can continue to do everything alone, but to be honest, in the long run it makes me tired and unhappy.
In University I was completely alone, at work I feel lonely, at the gym I'm alone, I go running alone, I watch a movie and I'm alone.
It would be nice to have someone to share these moments with.

I wouldn't wish my level of loneliness on anyone.
I hope you have a wonderful New Year's Eve. I'll probably watch a movie, recommend me one.
