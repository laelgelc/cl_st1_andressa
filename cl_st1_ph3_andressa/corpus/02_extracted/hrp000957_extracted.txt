I genuinely have gotten to the point where I just feel empty, I feel like I can never connect with anyone and I hate it. I have this overwhelming thought that I’m a bad person and I deserve this, that I deserve to be alone and tired all the time. I don’t know why I feel so depressed again after everything, my life is objectively looking better but I feel forgotten. I feel like I don’t fit in anywhere and I don’t know why.
