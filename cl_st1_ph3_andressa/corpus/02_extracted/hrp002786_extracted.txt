I'm a very lonely guy at 23 years of age, soon to be 24 in a few months. I haven't had anyone that I could consistently call a friend that I'd see every day since 21. My parents are a part of a cult called the Independent Fundamental Baptist church, where you're not allowed to hang out with people who do drugs, drink alcohol, or listen to any music with a catchy tune. In other words, you're not allowed to be a "normal" person with "normal" interests, or, at the very least, they can't take precedence over going to church.

All I've wanted, ever since I got my associate's, finally got a job so I can provide for myself, and be able to pay for my own shit with my own money is to finally get a social life, in particular a girlfriend. But considering that I'm still financially dependent upon my parents for at least the next two years here while I try to get my bachelor's, I'm really just stuck in my room with most of my free time being devoted more to playing games by myself. Personally, I'm an atheist, and I just want to get out there, make some friends, and find a girl who's not going to get triggered by everything in the entertainment that I like, as they're also very particular about entertainment, especially around kids when I played Mortal Kombat growing up and personally turned out OK.

I mean, is it normal to fear becoming a loner when you don't want to? And how would you guys suggest I get out of this hole?
