Wat do loners do for renting and employment references? Family not being an option. I feel like I have to dig deep or ask a stranger to just help me out cause I’m a loner n don’t wanna have to hang on to people just to use them for a reference when the time comes. Sometimes I’m just honest with the employer/landlord but sometimes they say it’s corporate that requires it. I need to move there are humans living way too close.
