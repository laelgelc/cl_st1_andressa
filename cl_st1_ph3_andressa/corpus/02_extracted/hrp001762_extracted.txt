I have 3 friends but I’m pretty sure they don’t like me. They all hang out together without me and talk about plans I’m not involved in right in front of me. At this point I’m not sure they even consider me a friend. I can talk to people fine, but no one seems super eager to actually spend time with me. I’ve started acting a bit more sarcastic, maybe a bit aloof to try and distance myself, so when it fully hits that I have no one it hurts less. It isn’t working. I’m also worried that in doing so I’m preventing people from actually getting to know me. I feel like I’m just adrift with no one holding me down. I don’t know what to do.
