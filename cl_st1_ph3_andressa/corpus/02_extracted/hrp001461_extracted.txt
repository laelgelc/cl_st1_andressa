Hi! I just thought we can make a group chat (preferably in an anonymous way) to share our journey, our plans and periodically how is it going for each one of us. 

I, particularly, am looking to be more open, and really connect with people. I behave in a way that makes it seem like I am not interested in others. A mix of shyness and fear of rejection. So I end up being lonely. 

So if we are in a group we can give each other advice, and follow up. I think the follow up is the major point. I'm Assuming we all want to stop being lonely IRL.

First problem is, I don't know what platform to use. I think reddit isn't made for something like this. So I am open to suggestions.

What do you think? Is there already something like this?
