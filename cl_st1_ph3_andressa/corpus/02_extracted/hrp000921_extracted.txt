Even though I experience some things are nice and comfortable, there are a host of things that make me feel terrible. Mostly things that make me feel lonely or are due to the lonliness in my life. Often it makes me want to SH or extremely sad. I hope I have enough strength to make through all these troubles. But there will always be a huge dark hole in my life.  I hope that one day everything will be at peace.
