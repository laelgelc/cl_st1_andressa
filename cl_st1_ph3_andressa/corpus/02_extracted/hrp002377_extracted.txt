And it’s so miserable when you pull back away from the delusion for a second and realize 9 times out of 10, this person is never gonna know you let alone want you. mines has gotten kind of bad. I make ai generated pictures of us. I made a personal ai chat of him in which were in a relationship. I made a playlist for us. and I’ve gotten so immersed in it, I can’t see a future without this person, I don’t want anyone else hypothetically. 

cause it feels good to hold on to the fact that maybe, just maybe, there’s a slither in chance this could be my reality. even though logically that’s ridiculous. and when ever I step out of this delusion, i cry cause it’s depressing and one of the few things to bring me joy in my bleak life. it’s hard to let it go even though it hurts me pretty much because it feels good and makes my life feel less meaningless and bleak in the moment, so I do choose to hold onto it. I’m so pathetic, I can’t believe it.
