See I loose nothing and this isn’t any last resort but js a way to put myself out there even if it’s anonymous lol, it’s a small step, I’m 18F and js been alone this past year, everyone is busy and so am I with work but on days where I did everything and I’m bored I’d love to have someone to talk to, and even hangout and play games and I have tried discord game servers but those are just matches, I genuinely want a friend yk
