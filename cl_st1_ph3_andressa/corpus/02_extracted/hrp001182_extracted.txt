ALmost 50; I have been thinking about lately, I've reached the age where i feel everybody in my circle thinks i already made. But deep inside, i know I'm struggling and there's  a lot of emptiness. I don't know how to express it or even where and when to start. When i do long drives for work, listening to music  keeps me awake en route but sometimes I feel it's nice to talk to someone.  Friends or family members are busy and they won't even entertain. so ending up listening to the same playlist. I don't know, it just feels lonely..
