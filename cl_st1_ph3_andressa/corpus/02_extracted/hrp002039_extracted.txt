tw suicide, death

im feeling really sad and lonely i received news of my family member who was found passed away in their home. it was literally just today so the autopsy results aren’t out yet but i cant help thinking it might have been self inflicted because of things they were going through. i don’t have a lot of experience with grief regarding close family members and im just feeling lost, i dont know who to talk to, if im allowed to talk to anyone, i feel triggered and i don’t know what to do. a lot of things are going through my head and i was just wondering if there is anyone out there that might hear this just to know what im going through
