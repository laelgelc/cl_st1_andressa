This might not get read by anyone but I wanted to vent here for a bit. I’m a m(23) and I just feel so…numb right now. There’s literally no one other than my parents who I talk to. I over heard them saying that they were tired of me always being with them and I don’t blame them. I’m a full grown adult so naturally I have to go out and find some people my age to hang out with right? That’s usually the case for everyone but not me. I’m not interesting, I can’t hold a conversation, I’m super awkward and I talk real low. Sometimes I just think that I’m meant to be alone in this world. It’s not a decision it’s just really hard for me to have someone else to be around with.
