I recently suffered a CVA and got diagnosed a Brain tumor , got into a whole lot of medical treatments. Chemo and radiotherapy. It took a bit of a toll on me mentally and emotionally. I was reaching out for my best friend and venting a lot to her with what I was going through. And she told me one day that she didn't want to hear it because it was a lot to her or something. But I needed a friend that'd listen to me in those hard moments I was going through. I ended up blocking her. A bit out of disbelief that my best friend couldn't or didn't want to support me in a moment like this. Now I feel lonelier than ever. Because I don't have that many friends. Maybe some online but it's hard making valuable connections. I kinda want the real thing. I also lost my boyfriend during this time which made things so much difficult as well.

Anyway, how are you coping with loneliness?
