Although this is a subreddit for loners I wouldn’t say that I’m a loner, I just feel alone. I usually don’t like to cry about my problems online because it has always just felt like a sad attempt at getting attention, but I don’t want to keep my feelings to myself  anymore. 

I’m 16 yrs old and I had depression about a year ago and it left some internal scars that I struggle with even today. I feel like I’m not good at anything and the things that I’m ok at I’m just bad compared to others. I’m not particularry goodlooking (ig: @juvenile.andy if you want some proof, not advertising at all) and I struggle getting any success with girls, I’m short (170cm) and that is a huge insecurity of mine and I’m not buff or anything. I have taken drugs and still do at some occasions, but I’ve gotten rid of my addiction, the only reason I use drugs is that I don’t have the courage of taking my own life (and don’t particularry want to) so I used/use drugs and alcohol to kill myself a little bit inside every day. I like to think that I will never get a girlfriend. Although I enjoy helping other people with their struggles. 

So that was my little confession...
