I feel like I'm nothing more than the awkward third wheel in everyone else's lives.

My best and only friend who I initially bonded with so deeply, who I thought were different and actually cared about me is now starting to treat me like a background priority, making no effort/showing no interest at all anymore to spend time with me. 

We are literally roommates and it took me a whole week to convince them to go out together once meanwhile they hung out with other friends and their partner. Tonight, they were having a hard time emotionally (personal reasons) and called up some guy they met like a week ago instead of talking to me who is right there. 

Those are just examples of many but it always ends up like this, I don't know wtf I'm supposed to do anymore. I try so hard to be there for everyone and nobody gives a shit. Am I selfish? Selfish to expect in return the same that I give out??? Do I stop making efforts too or what's the deal. I feel so fucking alone everyday, it just hurts constantly
