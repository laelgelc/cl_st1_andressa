I actually have to pay someone to act like they care….just being used one more time. God I wish it was all over. Fucked if I know why I am this way, is it too much to ask to just fucking blue tick me? Are people in my life so fucking indifferent to me? Hell I cannot even tell them how deep I am down the hole and how the black dog is curled up in my lap while a juggle a hand grenade because they re dealing their own shit.

If you are reading this you either have morbid curiosity into a decaying soul or you need  to know you are not alone. I know it gets better, but dont see the end of the hole….I do fell the tug on the pin of the grenade though…God what I would give for one. I am not suicidal but I would sign up for a suicde mission without thinking twice
