"I hate school" what a statement... Since I have not done much... When it comes to asignments... And been gone for 3 months.... I get more and more behind. The only talents i have is music related or art related. It's the typical "edgy" teenager post... Wanting to die because "I hate my family" i cant seem to connect with anyone at school. One teacher knows my quote on quote story.. And I have her as a support... I dont actually hate the whole... Education system per se... in fact school is the only place i can go other than the library
And the emancipation part... Yeah... My mom is 57 and yeah.. There's a language barrier... And when I try to quote on quote "runaway" from her, I'm being stupid, and making stupid decisions... Im worthless for failing my classes and whatnot... 
I'm 16 now, and life has drastically changed from middle school.... 
I have grown more mature... Just ... Have a whole shit ton to learn...
I am a internet addicted loner... I hate my reflection and i wish looks didnt matter so much... Sigh
I keep wanting things... I technically really do need New glasses... And I would love to get a cheap laptop or chromebook....
This generation.. I only have my phone...
If anyone wants to talk to me or rant I really want to help people, all i know how to do is feel sorry for myself
I am free to exchange phone numbers.. Discord instagram all that shitty social media crap.... 
Its weird how i met someone online that was a guy and he expects me to be this person that I am not..
I guess I am just a hopeless romantic that only wants to suffer and help people then help myself
I want to stop talking now...
16 years of being a loner I hope ... Life in general... Gets better...
