An argument with my sisters. And that common refrain was heard again. "You don't know what it's like to be a parent"

  
And they are right. The thing I wanted most in my life was denied me. I'm not gonna go into the whole story but. I never had a family, my marriage failed. 

It's my biggest regret. 

They can't understand how much that comment hurts me and I go home to my empty apartment.
