I have a very few friends but far away from me and I keep on talking on them hours and hours... Idk I just feel like keep talking to them but they just say me they have some work to do or something and cut after talking sometime. Even after lots of talks I still feel like I need more and more time from them. I sometimes feel like I am irritating them. How can I get rid of this.. I does all this because all of a sudden I feel like I am alone... And idk how to overcome these things..
