Had plans to host in-laws but because of a silly argument that has escalated my partner has been in a fight with me since yesterday and cancelled all the plans. He is in the same house but emotionally I am alone because he doesn't want to resolve, only keep fighting. I don't have any friends or family. I cooked all this food because NYE is a big thing in my culture (Eastern European). But I don't have anyone to call or text or visit this time. This is the first time in my life when I am completely alone on New Years Eve. 

Hope you are all having a good New Years eve!
