Recently I've realised I have no friends.

It all happened a bit suddenly; I return  home from uni two years ago. My friends from home have pretty much moved on - a couple have had kids, one moved out, one joined the navy. My friends from uni also moved one. One moved country, a couple moved far away for work, and the others just sort of lost contact. Not sure why. 

So, for the past two years I've sat at home on the weekends with my parents. Not ideal for a 24 year old man. Recently I started going out to bars alone, thinking it would be a good start to getting out of this rut I'm in, but that only sort of makes it worse as I can see what I'm missing out on first hand. 

My work mates are all cool, but they're all in their late fifties / early sixties so not really who I want to hang with. 

I've tried tinder for dates but got nothing back. 

Not sure what to do!
