Life’s been super hard lately just got out of prison for some charges that I did when I was younger selling stuff life was great at that point everyone loved me everyone would call me or want to be with me to the point where I would get annoyed cause I was never alone especially with females it was great don’t get me wrong but I was also going through I wouldn’t say depression more of an addiction and insecurity idk why well I know why cause of how I was raised. Besides all that now I come out of prison and I have no one literally I don’t even know why I look at my phone I’m 24 so starting over is crazy hard then I start talking to girls they see everything I been through and I understand that they don’t want that in their life but damn I’m blessed to be out and super happy to start over and do it right this time I know I’m still kinda young I’m just glad that everything happened that way.
