Should I be lonely because I want to or because you want me to? You don't want me to be lonely. Why? You feel bad about it. I want to be alone. Why? Because it's easier. Not always. Sure there are times when I want a hug, to see you smile, but alone I can be myself. Absolutely. My emotions are my own. I don't become too much for you to handle. I handle myself just fine. I'm not going to kill myself. I get it you're afraid that I will, but such is life. If one person dies, there's another billion getting ready to be born. My death wouldn't matter, but I still don't want that. I want to do me. I don't bore myself. I don't hate myself. I just don't want to deal with you, or your emotions. To do so would mean to be someone that isn't me. If I end up caring then enjoy it. It's not a common occurrence.
