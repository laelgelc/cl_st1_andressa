I like letter formats of communication more than small bubbles of text. I used to use an app that took that idea and polished it, but it's since become ads-galore, AI face recognition, mainstream garbage.

I don't like knowing when someone is texting me and vice versa. I like to take my time when writing (typing?). I also like sending pictures and audios once in a while. Email achieves all of that. It's a little personal and unconventional, though, so it's not appealing for most.
