Hey! I've been unemployed for the past year, working on an app, Augmy, to kick loneliness in the nuts. It's for real-time mood sharing with family and friends through progressive flowers. They bloom as you get better, and wither as you feel down.

I'm looking for people who would bring it to their loved ones and let us know how it can be improved to help **you** better!

My sister (she's doing better now) was suicidal while studying abroad, and we had no idea about what she was going through for years. So now I'm working every day, so less people can experience what we've experienced. Depression's a real bitch, and the idea of asking for help or unloading it on your loved ones seems like the least helpful thing to do. 

But it is ourselves and our loved ones who have the biggest impact on our lives and well-being. So while it is often the source of great pain and may be the very thing that got us into this shit, it can just as well help. 

Thank you for reading this far, you're a real one!
