D*ear friend*, I do feel like an odd one out more often than I consciously acknowledge. I just feel like an outsider. I was never so consciously aware of the space I take. I can’t claim my space, my existence. I always feel like I am taking up someone’s space. not just among American people but even around Indian people. Maybe a little more around American people as compared but then I shouldn’t feel like I don’t belong around Indians.

I stay in my little cocoon. I read I write, I watch movies. I don’t necessarily feel lonely. I am comfortable being by myself. When someone talks to me, I feel the need to make it worth their time talking to me. I don’t get mad at people as much as I used to. I mean I do feel rage but I don’t express as much as frequently and as boldly as I used to. I make plans and get excited about them but then I cancel them. I talk to myself a lot. Talking to myself is helpful in unraveling my thoughts. I feel like a loser. I feel lost. It’s not that I don’t have the potential to do things. I have great potential but it’s just that I am chasing way too many rabbits at the same time or maybe I am just thinking about chasing them but in reality, I am not pursuing even one.

I seek advice but then I don’t value advice so much. How can someone help me guide my path? I know myself better than anyone else. But do I really know myself as well as I think I do? I feel like a bullshitter. Trying to prove to myself that I am not a loser. I always assume that everyone assumes that am a loser.

Well, I haven’t won anything in life so far.

I keep reading and writing.

Somedays, I feel like I am preparing for a marathon in which I don’t know if I will ever get to participate or not.

Dear friend, I have no friends.
