So I’m currently 14 and going into highschool next year, and I feel this immeasurable dread constantly following me. I dont have any close friends and the friends I do have (primarily only at school) are just for the sake of having someone to talk to and it feels very superficial. Everywhere I go I cant help but feel like I have this horrible quality within myself that simply makes everyone including my family detest me. Its gotten to the point where I question wether or not Im a decent person. Im highly ambitious and I want to accomplish great things in life but if I can’t even seem to maintain mere friendships how could I possibly hope for more? Anyone my age or older, what could I do to get rid of this feeling and adopt a new mindset? I really just want to feel like im caught up with everyone else in life.
