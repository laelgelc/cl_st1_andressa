Okay so out of curiosity why do you think no one likes me. I try to make friends I was bullied growing up I had friends but lost them or they turned on me now I’m Turing 26 and don’t really have anyone I have two people I speak to via text and have done for a few years now but they hardly talk to me now and I just feel like it must be me, I’m not really loud or outgoing but I think I’m kind and caring I’d be there if someone needed me so why don’t people like me maybe I’m just not interesting enough 🤷🏻‍♀️
