Hello! I was invited to this subreddit and it all feels kinda cool. It’s like a secret club or something. Anyways, I should probably introduce myself.

I am a business major in college. I have a decent amount of friends and maybe 2-3 great ones. I do not get to talk to them that often, so it can get lonely. I’d overall say my attitude for the future flips between optimistic and pessimistic pretty often.

I really enjoy animals, astronomy, video games, anime, and movies (I’m trying to watch the ones people always reference). I also play on PSN if you care about that. I also enjoy talking about dystopian future stuff and paranormal things. (I even got some stories).

Anyways, thanks for reading this and have a better day.
