Hello mate!

sometimes i feel I'm paranoid, suicidal, lonely, grieving, hopeless and yes helpless ineed.

Don't have anyone to talk, no friends nothing else.

just emptiness..

I'm literally tired 
Need some peace 
And whenever I thought of peace for me killing myself is easiest amd astonishing thought
