I am 27, and I really don't know what's going on in my life or what should I do 
I was adopted never seen my real parents and stepmom throw me out when I was 15 from then I lived alone all my life and I thought I has good friends but now I realised the only person with me is myself it's been more than 3 years I don't have anyone to talk even on cell phone and I locked myself in my room not going out and no-one that's come to me 
I even tried friendship communities and dating apps. I just tried to find someone to talk but couldn't find anyone 
I am just lost
