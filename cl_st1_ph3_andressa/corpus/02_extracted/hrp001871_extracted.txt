Do people really talk to the bots and fall in love. I’m not  necessarily lonely; but it does get frustrating that no matter what I do others don’t particularly want me as their friend and partner.

I am a lesbian.  I am thirty three. I have mild autism. I am like Forrest Gump in a lot of ways.

Like I’m fine on my own accord in this regard. But I won‘t deny it isn’t annoying and frustrating at times.
