Just as the title states. Life gets really lonely when you're homeless. Not just that but when you're homeless you got to actively go out of your way to avoid people and avoid having interactions, both in person and online. Especially so in person because when you're hygiene is at an all-time low no one would want to talk to you or ask how you're doing.

Can't really talk to people online because the internet is a place where people have the most Freedom when it comes to expressing their personalities and interests. When you're homeless, you don't have much going for you other than wondering when the next time you'll be able to sleep, bathe, eat, etc. It's hard to talk about yourself and your life without being a Debbie Downer and it's not fair for other people to have to deal with that attitude. The internet is already a toxic enough environment.

All in all, it's tough. You can argue that I got what's coming to me. You can argue that I have no right to be upset about something like this you can argue that I don't deserve friends or accompaniment. And you're right. Absolutely correct, wouldn't even argue against it.

Still doesn't take away from the fact that I do feel these things. I have no friends and no family. I acknowledge that I am an absolute failure who's not worthy of other people's time and friendship. I've been like this for almost 7 years. Mom passed away, immediate family dissolved because of it, extended family doesn't support me emotionally and makes me feel like an absolute burden, which I was looking back at it to be fair.

All I'm trying to say with this vent is that I pretty much have next to no one in my life and it hurts. It really hurts. That's all.

But at least my 25th birthday is coming up...
