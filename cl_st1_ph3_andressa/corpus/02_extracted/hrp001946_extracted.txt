I hate to say this, but I’m not doing very great. I’ve been feeling so lonesome lately. And I’ll be honest, I’ve felt kind of..angry at everyone all the time. It’s very frustrating.

  
I only a few friends, but they’re more acquaintances. Theres one particular ”friend” group I have that seems to ”ignore“ (that’s a bit of an exaggeration) me. Whenever I ask a question or suggest something, most of them don’t even answer me, or it will take multiple times just for them to say, “Oh” or “I don’t know“ (if I’m asking a question). Perhaps it is environmental issues, I’m not sure. I dunno, but it hurts when it seems like they don’t care what I have to say. So yeah, I don’t feel very close with them. 

I have a couple other friends, but I can’t stand them sometimes. When I’m doing work or an activity with them, it feels like I have to drag them along, while they stand there and don’t even try. Plus, one of them says and does things that make me a bit uncomfortable, although it’s not that bad, and I find it kind of funny sometimes as long as it doesn’t go too far.

But I just feel extra bad because I know I’m probably a terrible person too, and I end up making excuses for them, whether they are accurate or not. Such as, “You probably just talk too quiet, so they don’t hear you. Plus, it’s not even that important. You’re not the center of the universe, so stop acting like this. You’re probably just overreacting.” 

I hate this so much, and I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t leave them because I have almost no one left. But still, it’s hard to be “friends” with people who make you feel terrible. Friends should make you smile and laugh, not make you cry. Or maybe I’m just too emotional, I dunno. I’m sorry for this and if there’s grammatical errors.
