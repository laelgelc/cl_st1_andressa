I always felt like an outsider still do...let's just get right into it.

Ever since maybe around 2010 maybe earlier my dad had a girlfriend which is related to another friend so on and so forth so it's just a big family. 

One of my cousins (Nonbiological) father passed away around 2016 and ever since then I haven't really spent time with that cousin and some other cousins too

The reason why I came here is to tell you how I feel left out aLoT and it is because most things they do like six flags and other fun stuff I just get left out. The only time I see them now is either during the summer or if I'm sleeping over a uncle's house. Every since my cousins father passed away it felt like a barrier between me and my cousins and I just feel like an outsider. Also I'm not biologically related to anyone of my cousins family members.

Also sometimes they're uncle's and aunties don't even talk to me only whenever they see me and even then don't really talk to me and never really reached out and invited me to anything. There is only one uncle I can think of that doesn't do this that are related to my "cousin".

I remember crying telling my actual uncle on my mother's side and he comes from a same background like I am right now. He says not to worry about them and it's they're loss. What do you think? Should I really even care?
