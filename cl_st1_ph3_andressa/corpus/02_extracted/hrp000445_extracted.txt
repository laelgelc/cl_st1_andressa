Fuck people, fuck religion, fuck politics, fuck the holidays, and FUCK MY LIFE.

I spent Valentine's Day alone, my birthday alone(I've actually NEVER been wished happy birthday, or gotten a present, or even eaten cake on my birthday. Like, HOW is that even POSSIBLE?!?!), pride month alone, thanksgiving alone, Halloween alone, Christmas alone and drunk, and now I'll be spending new years alone and drunk. I've done NOTHING this year, or the last, or almost EVERY year, because I missed out because nobody told me about it, or I have nobody to do anything with, there's nothing to do close to where I live, or I just can't afford to do whatever there is to do

My parents keep trying to solve my problems by preaching at me, stupid ignorant people keep telling me to just learn to be happy by myself, and then somehow it won't matter, I'm so fucking sick of hearing about politics, especially when STUPID people talk about politics, I'm sick of littering and pollution, I'm sick of rich people doing fuck all to help the world, im sick of celebrities and influencers getting away with horrible things and perpetuating toxic, ignorant life styles, I'm sick of The goddamn fucking absurd cost of just being alive.

I'm so fucking sick of people not being able to understand just how fucking difficult it is to get up in the morning, dress myself, brush my teeth, and eat, and my dad is ALWAYS on my ass about what I'm doing with my time and life, when realistically, the answer is just TRYING NOT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF.

Everything just SUCKS
