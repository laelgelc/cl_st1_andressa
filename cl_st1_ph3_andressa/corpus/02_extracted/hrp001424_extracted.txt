I know this might not be the “correct” sub for this, but I honestly can’t think of anywhere else that feels right, so I’m posting here.

・Every time my cousin messages me, my heart just sinks  

・When people ask me to take a group photo for them, I can’t do the “3-2-1” countdown out loud—I just silently count with my fingers.


・When I have to talk to a cashier or clerk, I ask my mom to wait far away because I can’t handle her watching or hearing me


I feel like there’s something wrong with me
