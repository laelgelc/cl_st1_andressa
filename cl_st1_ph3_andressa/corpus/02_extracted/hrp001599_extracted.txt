Why Care  


I was thinking lately why care?  
Worrying too much about the future  
Without knowing if we'll ever get there.  

Waking up the next day  
With a whole lot of words on your mind  
That you can't say.  

Being misunderstood like the moon,  
Lending her light ray  
So we can be freshly energetic through the day.  

But she's hardly seen for her work 
We sleep when she perform,  
Not knowing without her,  
Our lives are threatened by a storm.  

But the moon had thought to leave  
Till one cried to applaud her
The wolf who howled.  

And the moon stared at moments, proud,  
The wolf hoping she hears her sound.  

She stays
Because she realizes her presence is admired.  
The wolf stays up at night  
To keep her company,  
With no rest  
Or fret of becoming tired.  

They both found worth in each other,  
Through ray and eye.  

But even they depart  
When it’s time to say goodbye.  

So what’s the use.
