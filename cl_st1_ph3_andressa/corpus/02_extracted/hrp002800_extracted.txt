Never really sought out friends, though I'm blessed to have a few good ones. Personally, I feel more comfortable in my own company. I usually don't have a lot to say.. I guess it's because I've always been attached to family friends. I wasn't taught to "go outside, make some friends." I was a shy kid anyway. Still am hahaha. 

I just want to point out that not all loners are mad at the world. We're just happy alone, trust me :)
