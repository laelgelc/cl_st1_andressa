I just wanna remind you that the worst punishment is solitary confinement. And I know you can be stuck in your ways and you wanna be alone. And people have let you down in the past. But we’re not supposed to be alone. I promise you. A good community is absolutely life changing. You just haven’t found your people yet. There are people out there that uplift you and wanna support you. But the worst punishment that one can ever have is getting locked up by themselves. For them to be alone with their own mind. Think about that. When you are the worst criminal they lock you up to be by yourself in your own mind. So what does that say psychologically about us? We need people. If you haven’t found your community yet, go find it. If you’re still looking for it, follow me. One is not meant to be alone. Find your people. It’s very important.
