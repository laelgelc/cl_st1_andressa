I feel like I've reached a point of exhaustion after being there for everyone else when no one shows up for me. It doesn't even matter whether I exist in people's lives or not. It makes no difference. People are good to me in general with some being exceptions. However, no one really thinks about me or shoes concern/care/affection except for maybe my parents. I have a couple friends and a few acquaintances. But nobody really cares. It's been years and I've been holding on to the hope that one day, some day this would change. I'll also be loved and cared for the way I'd like to. I'm not too if that day will ever come. The longer I go on like this, the less I expect from people. And then that chain goes on. Everybody just takes my existence for granted. And then I feel more distant from the world. Does it ever get better? Does one learn to go on with their lives with zero expectation from anyone?
