Hey, just joined Reddit today, want to say a little bit of feelings on loneliness. Me 46 living with my dad 74, no husband and no kids. One friend. And nobody else. Went through some shit in life and cut out of really sick people. Some people in your life just want to watch you fall or are so negative and put you down all the time. I have trust issues so it is not easy for me to meet anybody and just start to hang out. So I am lonely as hell! And I am always wondering how other people got families and supports and friends. I’d start with church but it is boring as hell and I feel like people just have agendas. Anyways, just want to shout out there or trying to figure out ways to socialize.
