Hello all names Wolfgang 26 now and honestly loneliness is a bitch... Have a lot of friends but still I'm still alone. I swear all my single friends will find partners and then I'll be truly alone I fear more than anything is being forgotten like why does no one wants me ? They say you don't need a relationship to be happy but for me it's different I need someone to complete me idk sorry for the rant
