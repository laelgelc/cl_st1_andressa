Like its pretty discouraging where people kind of just disappear on you without a word even when you've tried to connect with them. 

You could talk to them for like a day or two and then their gone, or lets say they did talk to you for a long time, they jusy find some reason to just throw everything away or just stop entirely.

Maybe its just me?
