Hello,

It is with a great deal of hesitation and humility that I am reaching out today to ask for help.

I am 24 years old and I share my life with two cats who mean everything to me. For several years, I have been living with a cyclical depressive disorder, ADHD, and chronic anxiety. Despite doing my best to keep going, my mental health recently forced me to stop working, as I was no longer able to perform my job properly.

On top of this, one of my cats, Azraël, a sweet little ginger furball, had to undergo an unexpected veterinary surgery. The combination of these events has unfortunately led to financial difficulties that I am struggling to handle on my own.

I do not expect anything, and I am fully aware that there are many causes far more urgent and many people suffering more than I am. If you are able and willing to help, even in a small way, it would mean an incredible amount to me and would help relieve some of the pressure during this difficult time.

Every contribution, no matter the size, and every kind thought is deeply appreciated more than I can express. Thank you sincerely to everyone who takes the time to read this, and to those who choose to help, whether here or elsewhere.

I wish you a kind and gentle year ahead.
