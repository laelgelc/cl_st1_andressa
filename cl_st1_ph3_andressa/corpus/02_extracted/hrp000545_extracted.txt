I’m in that phase where I’ve decided to focus on myself, build my life, and not chase relationships or distractions. And honestly… I don’t want a relationship right now.
But nobody talks about how lonely this phase can get.Some nights you just want to be wanted. Not even in a deep way lo, just to matter to someone. To be checked on. To feel chosen, even a little.
Instead, it’s just you, your thoughts, and learning how to sit in silence while everyone else seems to be living loudly.

I know this phase is necessary. I know it’s building something in me.But it still hurts sometimes man.

Just wondering if anyone else here is in this season too.
