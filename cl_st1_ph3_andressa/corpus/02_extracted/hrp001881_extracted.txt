So, i just made this account to post this , I don't how many of you had this but from childhood i am \[(18/M) now \] the one who loves to observe the things happening around you than being a part of it like ,if your friends (so called) having a conversation i love to just observe it but sometimes you also had to jump in the conversation in order to fit in. But whenever i am alone i just loves that but sometimes it just becomes too much as there is no one in your life except your family, and you cannot share your inner feelings to someone who actually understands you . IDK if it's my problem or some of you also has it but sometimes i cant even talk to a girl because of that problem .If you have any advice feel free to give some :-)
