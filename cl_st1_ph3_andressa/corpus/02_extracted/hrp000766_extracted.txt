I’m tired of craving something i will never ever get, i ache every. Single. Day. Not a fucking day have passed since i was 19 I wasn’t craving an emotional loving relationship where i feel seen, chosen and most importantly loved. 
I’m sick of “love yourself and love will find you”, because this is the most numbing sentence to say and does not reflect reality. I reached to a level where I SERIOUSLY convince myself that i will never be loved i will never be chosen to marry and I genuinely try to make peace with it.. but i somehow know that this is a fucked up idea to even think that i’m not deserving of love. I am extremely exhausted, drained and hurt of reaching this level. I even convinced myself that it’s okay if i took my own life if loneliness ever gets unbearable
I’m in extreme pain since long time ago and it’s only getting worse. 
I sometimes “ like now” do feel my heart is about to jump out from anger towards myself and life, feeling that inhale is not passing oxygen to my organs, breathing feels like heated smoke in my bloodstream. 

I am tired of hoping, tired of waiting, tired of being extremely tired
