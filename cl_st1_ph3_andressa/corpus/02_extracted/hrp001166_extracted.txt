Hey everyone,

I’ve been through the ringer with "support" lately—psychologists who seem to stretch sessions to waste time, and gurus who just want to sell expensive courses. It made me feel like my struggles were just a transaction.

I want to offer the opposite. I’m looking to be a listener for a few people who need to drop the mask. I’m not a professional or a guru, just someone who values real human presence.

I know that on many platforms, you might still get ignored even when you open up. In this Discord space I've created, I am willing to listen and respond to each one of you personally.

**How I do this:** I use a private Discord setup where we can talk 1-on-1 using a text channel. It’s completely anonymous, and a bot will delete the conversation afterward so you can leave your baggage there and walk away with no trace left behind.

I don’t want to fix you or judge you. I just want to listen. It’s 100% free (I have an optional donation link for the server costs, but I honestly don't expect or require it—the connection is what matters to me).

If you’re feeling overwhelmed or just need to be heard by a real person, please **send me a DM or chat.** I’ll send you the info to connect.
