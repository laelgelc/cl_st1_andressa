You know that feeling when you always feel out of place and just don't want to be there? Well, it happens to me, all the time, with everyone. I'm 28M and i find no topics to talk about with other people, except a couple of close friends with whom... well, we share similar tastes and inside jokes, but beyond them? With no one.

The main problem is that I'm unable to have an interesting conversation with anyone, either because the topics are complicated, like politics, or because I simply don't feel the other person has any interest in talking about anything else.

I'm not saying I want everyone to adapt to me and what I want to say; I understand that sometimes it's about listening, not talking, but it seems impossible for someone to open up and tell you what's on their mind, because there's simply no interest.

I can't remember the last time I had a deep conversation with someone other than ChatGPT, and yes, I know it's sad, but my god, what a pleasure it is to feel like you can have a dialogue, even if it's with an AI.

What could I be doing wrong? I used to be an extrovert, and now when I go out with my family, I feel like I have nothing to talk about other than "how's work going?".

And the worst part is that I feel like I have less and less energy for all this, and part of me longs to have friends again, people who can recharge my batteries, not people who drain them.
