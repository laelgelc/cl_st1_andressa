Hey, I’m Ammar (online I go by Untamed Draws). I’m a professional concept artist — I spend most of my days helping bring stories and ideas to life for books and media. On the outside, it probably sounds like a dream job. And in many ways, it is. But honestly? Lately, I’ve just been feeling incredibly lonely.

I spend a lot of time in my own head, creating, thinking, overthinking... and while I love art and everything that comes with it — music, games, food, meaning, love, self-care, even things like home building and gardening — none of it really fills that space where human connection should be.

I’m an empath, which makes it even harder sometimes. I feel people deeply, but lately it feels like there’s no one around to feel with, if that makes sense.

I guess I’m just reaching out, hoping to find someone who understands what that kind of loneliness feels like. Someone who doesn’t mind slow conversations, deep thoughts, or just existing quietly together when the words aren’t there.

If any of this resonates with you, even a little, I’d love to talk. Whether it's about life, art, the weirdness of existence, or just how your day went — I’m here.

Thanks for reading.
