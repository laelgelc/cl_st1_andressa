I've always enjoyed having a good amount of time to myself as long as I had a social event on the horizon to look forward to.

I have always had a small group of friends 5-8 and probably twice as many acquaintances. In my teens and 20s I could always count on a least one event or good hang every few weeks with one or a group of these people. I don't do well with romantic relationships because it's just too much contact and communication and it overwhelms me. Having this group of friends and acquaintances made it possible for me to socialize and have things to look forward to.

Well, over the past decade these events and hangs have been on a slow decline. Now they basically don't exist at all. I'm lucky if I get one night a month to go watch a game at a buddy's house while his kids tear shit up and make relaxing and conversation impossible. 

I bought a house two years ago and have only been able to get one person to come see it.

Friends without kids? Forget it, they don't want a third wheel around. 

I have bad social anxiety but I've been forcing myself to get out and enjoy things since the pandemic died down. I do 99% of these things alone. I want to try to make friends when I'm out at these events but I feel like such a loser being there by myself.

The worst part is, I know it's only going to get worse. I'm basically at the point of giving up, even with my long-term friends.
