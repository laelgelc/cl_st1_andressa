In general, I'm not a person with many friends or loved ones, but when someone comes along and becomes very important to me, I end up developing an extreme attachment. That makes me feel even more alone than I already am; a simple silence from that person for a few hours feels awful. The attachment ends up making me distance myself because of that feeling, and I'm alone again.
