Hello, im 27, i have only dated once but it only left me with insecurities and low self esteem. Ive been feeling really down and depressed ever since, no matter what i do, it just wont go away. Everyday is a constant battle to get out of bed, even if im sourrounded by people and family i just feel alone and i can feel physically a pain in my chest, everynight i cant fall asleep and i keep thinking about how miserable i am. How do you cope with loneliness, i cant anjoy anything anymore, i need advise please
