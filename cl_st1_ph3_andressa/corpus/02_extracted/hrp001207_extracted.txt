Hi I'm 21 Asian man. If there's any of you that have been searching for a friends I am willing to be a friend but make sure we have things that doesn't compromise values. It's been so alone for a years due to social rejection and feeling left out. I wanna make sure that friendship will build a meaningful bond that creates permanent benefits.
