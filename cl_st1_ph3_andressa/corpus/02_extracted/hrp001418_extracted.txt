i’ve always felt so inherently unlikeable and unlovable. every single time i feel like getting genuinely close to someone, they eventually see more of me and things fall apart again. i’m so awkward and anxious and terrified of other people, i just don’t know to exist in this world. i’m so painfully lonely and i just want real connection so badly but it feels impossible. i’m in so much pain.
