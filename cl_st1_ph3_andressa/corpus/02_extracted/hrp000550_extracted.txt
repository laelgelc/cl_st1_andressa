I just realized I am truly and completely alone. I feel like my life is falling apart. And I don’t have anyone I can run to. I deserve it anyway. I am alone because of my own actions. I just can’t help but feel like the whole world is weighing in on me and I have nothing but my own shoulders to carry all of the pain. 

I am simply tired. I am worn down, beaten and broken. I give up.
