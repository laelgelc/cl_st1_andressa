I’m not really sure what my goal with this post is, just rambling really. 

At M26, I know I’m capable of socializing just fine, but it takes an insane amount of energy from me. Plus with my low self-esteem and social anxiety I just can’t be bothered to try and make friends anymore, especially when the odds of anything lasting are so low. I also tend to try way too hard to make people constantly happy and that’s so tiring and demoralizing after never feeling that being reciprocated.

I went through 5 years of college and graduated without making a single friend (technically I had some acquaintances, but nothing serious at all). I work fully remote, so making friends at work is never really a thing either. At this point I’m almost taking pride in how far I’ve been able to go without support groups or friends in general. 

I do have my girlfriend who I live with, she’s great but outside of her I have literally no social life. I don’t text anyone else, I barely even engage with other people online (outside of this lol), it just takes too much out of me.

Part of me feels sad like I missed out on so much of life, but on the other hand it’s so much easier and pain-free this way. Idk if this is normal, probably not, I guess it might be nice for others who have had similar experiences to read this.
