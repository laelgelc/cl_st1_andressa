Sometimes it feels like I am living more in memory than in my own life, like the past has more color than the days I am standing in now. I find myself aching for versions of time that cannot hear me, wishing I could step back into moments before I knew how heavy everything could feel, before I started questioning who I am and what all of this is supposed to mean. There is something devastating about realizing that while I am busy missing what is gone, the present is quietly becoming another thing I will one day mourn. No matter how badly I want to return, time does not bend for longing, it only keeps moving forward, indifferent to how unprepared I feel. The sadness is not just that the past is unreachable, it is that meaning and love are still here, right now, and I am afraid I am letting them slip through my fingers while I search for something I think I already lost. One day this exact moment will haunt me with its softness, and I will wonder why I did not hold it closer. So I have to ask myself, what do I actually miss, and what am I taking for granted right now.
