(19) I’m beyond Alone, and people around me genuinely hate me, there are rumours about me that are awful and false, plus I believe new ones which I don’t know of, and it makes no sense that the same people who made my life hell in highschool would still treat me like this even after it. It makes me angry to know that there living there life’s with friends when I’m stuck at rock bottom where they want me to be.
