It’s strange how much of ourselves we give trying to build a connection with someone, man or woman. We show up. We stay consistent. We listen. We care. We make space for them. We try to matter.

And somehow, over time, we fade.

I didn’t become invisible by being unimportant.

I became invisible by being useful.

I came up with that line because I’ve lived it more times than I can count. Being the person people lean on. Being the one who understands. Being there when it’s convenient or needed. And then, when they don’t need you anymore, you’re gone.

It makes you question things. Are friendships real? Are relationships real? Or are they just stories we tell ourselves while the fantasy lasts?

Maybe loneliness isn’t the absence of people. Maybe it’s what’s left when you realize how replaceable you are once you’ve served your purpose.

I don’t know the answer. I just know this feeling isn’t rare, even if nobody likes to admit it.
