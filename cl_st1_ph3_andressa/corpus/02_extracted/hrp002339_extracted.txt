I feel so completely off. Like, I’m sorta loosing it. I don’t know if it’s because I stopped my medications or if it’s something else. I wish I could go clubbing and party and get drunk and have the time of my life. Go ride on a motorcycle, go to another club dance all night, snort cocaine, makeout with a stranger i don’t fucking know dude. I’m so fucking deprived of fun. I do nothing. I have no one. I have no friends. Im so alone all the time. This isn’t just miserable, my life; but it’s painful. So painful.
