I’ve always felt popular. Always had friends. I’m now 35 and for the first time I’m afraid I’ll end up alone forever. Two of my closest friends have recently left the city and I currently meet one friend per month, and I’m ashamed to tell them I’m lonely because I’m afraid it will turn them off and then I’ll be even more lonely. I have always lived a solitary life, I’m a creative person and work in customer service as my day job where I can work from home. I have enjoyed being alone probably because I knew I had friends out there if I needed them. But now I’m worried I will soon have no more friends and will have no way of making new ones because I have bad social anxiety and intimacy issues. Just wanted to see if anyone can relate. Hope this finds you well.
