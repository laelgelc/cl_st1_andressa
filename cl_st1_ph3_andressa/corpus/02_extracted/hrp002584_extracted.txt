i feel like there’s the people who choose to be loners, then there’s the people who are literally too weird, or their communication and body language are so dam underdeveloped that people stay away(me lol). anyone else the same way? how do you guys live and be happy???? i work a ton (and that helps!) but literally every day i’m off i just want to just die because the loneliness bites;-; any tips on how to deal with loneliness?
