I usually don’t do this… because I feel like guilty. I feel like a part of this is my fault because I really don’t… try anymore? I mean, I try to make plans, but then people cancel. And I feel like a shell of myself… I really do. I feel like I don’t try hard enough…and I feel really bad, but honestly, how can I even try when it feels like no one else tries for me? That sounds bad, I know, but I really don’t know… I just want someone to relate to or talk to you..
