**You make my life beautifully alone.**

&#x200B;

You are the eye’s through which I see,

the ears through which I hear,

the only hands that I *need* to touch me.

&#x200B;

**And yet your love only makes me free.**

&#x200B;

I walk along in solitude,

in a quiet world you afford,

a life untroubled by ‘The Norm’.

&#x200B;

**You stand the wall against the storm.**

&#x200B;

With you I can live Beautifully Alone.

&#x200B;

**The only wife I’ll ever know.**

&#x200B;

The only one that’s ever let me walk alone.

It seems you’ve found the keys to my soul.

&#x200B;

To live a life with you,

**Beautifully Alone.**

&#x200B;
