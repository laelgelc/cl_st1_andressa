I honestly cannot do it, I don’t know what is with me. My whole body freezes and when the situation comes I genuinely cannot talk about things I enjoy. I don’t mind learning what other people like, but when it comes to me I simply cannot share anything.

My favorite shows, books, music, movies… I have these things that I do genuinely consume and have a liking for, but I don’t feel safe sharing anything of it, I feel like I’ll just humiliate myself for some reason. I have thought about it in my head and said that I would try to be more social… but I cannot connect when it comes to it.

When someone asks me what songs I listen to, I reflexively lie and say I don’t really listen to music, I can’t share any of my interests, NOT EVEN WITH MY PARENTS… I don’t know where this fear came from and I’m tired, I realize everyone thinks I’m boring and don’t have anything to offer because I never share anything, but it genuinely feels like I’ll puke along with the words that leave my mouth if I do decide to talk. So much nervousness that it feels safer to lie about all of it.
