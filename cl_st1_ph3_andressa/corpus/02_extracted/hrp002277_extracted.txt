I feel very lonely right now, and I can't talk to anyone anywhere. I'm too busy trying to fix my messed up family, my friends never want to come to uni to see me or to go to class or anything for the past year, and my only other friend hasn't responded to me in 2 weeks. Feels like everyone has a reason to leave me alone and now I have no one to turn to. Haven't spoken to my school friends in years because they stopped responding. Feels pathetic to sit in class all alone knowing they could've come but chose not to, or they have a valid reason so I can't even be mad.
