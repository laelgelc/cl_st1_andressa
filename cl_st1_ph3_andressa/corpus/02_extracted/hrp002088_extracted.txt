I know the title says how to be content by yourself, but I’m also hoping for advice on how to build relationships in general. Most people tend to just say to be confident in yourself first, but how have you become able to do that? I am a 21 year old male and I’ve never been able to cultivate a real friendship or manage to get a girlfriend. I’ve steadily improved myself physically over the past couple years and will continue to do so, but mentally I struggle immensely. Right now I have nobody I can turn to, I have maybe my mother but she gives the most surface advice along the lines of “cheer up” and I already despise talking to people for this topic because I feel like it’s a burden to them, like who genuinely wants to have to play therapist for someone is my thought process, ya know. Anyways, I just feel like if I’m going to start to build anything substantial with a stranger, I really do need to start with myself. Anyone who’s struggled with having no relationships and feeling like they’re ignored in daily life, how have you managed to overcome or at least progress the right way? I’m very worried I will harm myself at this point because overtime the loneliness can only build more as the time collects. I’m sure this sounds like the same situation as thousands of other posts here and it isn’t unique to me, but we still all turned to this subreddit for a reason I suppose. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
