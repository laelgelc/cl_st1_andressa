I’m going into my senior year of college. I went to college in the same town where I went to high school so I knew quite a few people going into college but now I talk to very few people outside of the people I work with. That is partially due to the pandemic, but mostly due to the fact that I haven’t talked to anyone I didn’t have to throughout college. It just takes so much energy for me to make new friends and keep up with them.
