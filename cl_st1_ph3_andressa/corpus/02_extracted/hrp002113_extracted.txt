This post is mostly made so i can come back later and look at the replies, im not looking for a longer discussion  
Ive turned 22 a couple weeks ago and noticed that im the only one out of my friends that havent had any romantic experience or anything similar in my life, i was always the one standing out and even with my friends it seems that im the least connected one and my friendships all feel artificial and that i cannot form real bonds  
This of course fucks up my brain a lot, so much unnecessary suffering going on inside of it, and i know its mostly my fault because of fucked up i am but i am not looking to change my ways, i only wanna know how to get rid of the primal desire to be loved/appreciated, because its killing me and i want it to stop, i feel so lonely and misunderstood and i just want it to stop
