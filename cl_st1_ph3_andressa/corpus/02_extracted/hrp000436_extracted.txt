I'm seeing so many people party every weekend with their friends. Be around their best friends all the time traveling everywhere. I never went to university and haven't made any friends within the past couple of years. I feel like I'm wasting my life away and I hate not having fun experiences with people. I do everything alone...

People never seem to take interest in me when I try to get to know them. I have been told I'm bubbly and easy to talk to and I don't get it😭 I literally have no one. I wish I had a couple of friends to laugh and be weird with. I'm 25 F and can't make any girl friends even when I try to go out of my way to ask to hangout. I graduated college 4 years ago and still made no friends.
