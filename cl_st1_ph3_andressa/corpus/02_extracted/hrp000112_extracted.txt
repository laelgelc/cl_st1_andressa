Honestly, I haven't made a proper friend in years. I'm looking for a kind, generous woman for real companionship—someone to share daily chats, hoz day, thoughts, interests, and memes with, without it ever feeling like an obligation.

My question isn't just "Am I destined to be alone?" but "Can we build a connection that's more meaningful than the temporary dopamine hit of a new chat?"  
If you're looking for the same, message me.
