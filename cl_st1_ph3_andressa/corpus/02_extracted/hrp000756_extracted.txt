I want to leave everything behind. My life, the people I know. I want to start over. I'm tired of being lonely. This might be a lot to ask but I want someone to let me live with them. I'm not joking. I would like to make music and/or streaming. I would like someone (or more than one person) to let me live with them and we could stream together or make music. I'm haven't really done much but I know I would be good and I would love it. It's the only thing that would make me happy. Please help me 🙏 It need to be fast. I think I'm going to end it...I want to disappear, start a new life
