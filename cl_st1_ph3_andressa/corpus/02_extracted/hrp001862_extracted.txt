Normally I don’t put such things up but today is my birthday and I feel really depressed. I’ve had boring birthdays before but today’s energy around seems so off, like I just feel so negative. I am an immigrant so I don’t really have very close friends or family over here. I do have a few people who celebrated my birthday and gave me gifts but it felt like they were obligated to do so, because we always do this for each others birthdays and it seems like something forced. Honestly that hurts more than anything, like obligatory wishes feel like not being around was a better choice. I consider being born today as a problem to everyone around me and it sucks. I’m either tearing up or crying the whole time, and it hurts my head and chest so bad. As you grow older, you lose a lot of people along the way, and people around get super busy so they don’t really have the time for you. Most of my close friends have forgotten to wish me, and going through breakups(friendships and relationships), depression, homesickness, and a lot of other things, it just feels bad now. I’m trying my best to get out of it, but it seems useless. I might be exaggerating with my feelings and I’m really grateful to the ones who actually cared about me today, but it’s just the energies being released making me feel this way. I hope I’m not exaggerating. I really have no other medium to pour this out because the more I tell these stuff to my friends, they’re gonna just leave me for being super sensitive and not handling things. I really miss my family being around me too.
