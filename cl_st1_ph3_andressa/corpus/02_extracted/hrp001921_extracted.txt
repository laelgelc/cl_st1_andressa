Lately I’ve been thinking about how many people quietly feel alone or out of place, even when they don’t talk about it. I’ve felt that way myself for a long time, and it’s a heavy feeling to carry.

I think a lot of us are outcasts in different ways, and because of that we understand pain, isolation, and the desire for peace more than we admit. Sometimes life itself feels overwhelming, and all anyone really wants is to feel calm, happy, and free for once.

I’m not asking anyone to open up or explain themselves just putting this thought out there for anyone who needs to hear it: you’re not strange or broken for feeling this way, and you’re not the only one dealing with it in a world that often feels chaotic.
