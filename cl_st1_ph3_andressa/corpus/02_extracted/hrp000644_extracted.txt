Me, 26M after a breakup because my girlfriend just sleep with another one, just make me realize that I love her but not her person just what I wanted to see in her.  
  
Couple of weeks after trying to make me a favor and repair all that we had together I realize again that it was just me. If someone loved didn't try to speak to much about that is scary, but if don't want to change things for today and tomorrow so it's worse, what can I say, maybe being alone isn't that bad, after a thing like that.  
  
She just makes me realize that we cannot be happy because we don't want the same, and that thing that I was talking is just about a future together, having a dinner with our parents or friends, build a home for us or just watch a night without having to spend a lot of money because "it would be boring". 

Some people just want use you, listen when I say that if you are alone, maybe just need some friends, that what I was making by going to a park, a club or a party and free myself from being a slave of love, she didn't love me the way I was thinking and my mistake was not accepting being alone, it's not a bad thing by itself and maybe some people would say "at least you had something some time", well... could be true but I don't see a value in that just by itself, is what you make with that and believe if I say you could learn the same just by listen that and have friends.

Love will come but don't take any, will spend your life, just take the good ones and have friends please, that would make me avoid so many bad things in my past that is the best having it now.

And just one more thing, it's better be happy and being nice than being a "alpha" like internet show everyday, I have something because I was a happy and nice person than taking notes from a nonsense couch.
