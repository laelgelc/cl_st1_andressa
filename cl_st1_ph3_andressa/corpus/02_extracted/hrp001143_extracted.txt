Hi, I'm new here and kinda felt bad about actually coming to this but it really feels like every time I try and go into a positive phase, I take one step up and then fall ten steps down. In the last two weeks, I've had like 4 people just stop contact with me randomly and I was thinking that we were getting along great. Including one of two years who swore to me they'd never leave me, now someone is telling me to wait until they're drunk at the weekend to tell me "bad news". I didn't attend school much because of family issues and now I hardly know anyone, is it normal to really have this much... bad luck? Seems to happen all the time.
