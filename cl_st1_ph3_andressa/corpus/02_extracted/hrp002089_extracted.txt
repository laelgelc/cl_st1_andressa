I'm slowly starting to settle into the fact that I'm gonna be alone, and that's okay. I have my cat, and eventually I'll find a new job that I can focus on. 

I think I'm starting to become more grounded in reality with my expectations, and I understand that women just won't, and don't like guys like me in romantic ways and that's okay. 

I will always be a friend, but never the first or even 2nd or 3rd friend, I'm here when there's no one else, and that's okay. 

I have my role in this life and in this world, and someone like me just doesn't get loved the same way I love people and that's okay. 

Just remember my place, and focus on staying alive.
