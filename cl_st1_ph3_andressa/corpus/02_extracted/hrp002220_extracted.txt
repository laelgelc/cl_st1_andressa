I ended my last relationship at the end of summer(it only lasted like 7 months long). The guy I was seeing was very sweet at first but quickly came to openly tell me I wasn’t enough for him. I took a few months off from dating but  started back up again right after Christmas. I had high hopes with the newest guy I was seeing but he’s started to ghost me lately. Idk why it’s so easy to let me go. Why the heck I’m never enough. I know I should take this as a sign to focus on me but I’m running out of time. I want to get married before my parents pass away. Lately I’ve just been contemplating settling for someone. It’s gotten so bad
