heyyy ive been feeling this way for years now but haven't really talked with anyone about it. how to get out of it? I think it's more than just being lonely it's more about being useless.
I have severe procrastination. I have seen so much stuff, so many people, big things that now small things don't excite me anymore. I'm tired. I don't know what to do. it has been effecting my mental as well as my physical health. I have been underweight to my age and my height.
this makes me feel so useless. no book, video, quote, or anything inspiring works for me. I try to understand myself, I try to believe but next moment I lose it all. I'm stuck and sad. I'm just alive. I forget things.
 I'm poor at everything. I don't know what I like, what I want to do.
