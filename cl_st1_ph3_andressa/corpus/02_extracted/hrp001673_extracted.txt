I’m 16 and haven’t had a friend in 6 years. I was homeschooled for most of my life and have no social skills. Having social anxiety doesn’t help either but recently it’s been better. Like how do you talk to people!? I don’t relate to anything anyone says so I just sit there awkwardly. I play volleyball which is something most of the super social people do (ig they’re popular?idfk) but people still don’t talk to me...I should mention that I’ve been playing for 6 years so I’m experienced like them too. I’m quiet but that’s only because I don’t know what to do. I’m so lonely and I can’t even help myself which makes me so frustrated. I struggle with mental health enough as it is and I feel like things just keep getting worse for me. I’ve gotten better but I’m starting to fall apart again. I just don’t want to be alone. Thanks for reading this far and sorry this turned into a vent... it’s midnight and I’m tired and In tears. Also if it matters I’m 16
