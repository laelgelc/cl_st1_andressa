Honest question.

Do any of you ever want to talk to people from other countries — not to learn a language, but just to chat or feel connected — and then stop yourself because of language?

Even when translators exist, using them usually means copy-pasting every message again and again, and the result often sounds stiff, formal, or emotionless. After a few messages, it feels tiring and kind of kills the moment, so you just give up.

I’ve been thinking about whether conversations would feel easier if translation happened automatically in the background — where you could just talk normally in your own language, and the other person receives it in theirs, while still keeping the tone, emotion, and context of what you meant, instead of turning everything into textbook sentences.

The idea isn’t perfect translation, just making conversations feel more natural and less stressful.

Do you think something like this would actually help people feel more comfortable talking, or would it still feel awkward?
