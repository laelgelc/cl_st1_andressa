16m, idk what to do with my life anymore. Sure I got my life figured out, I’ve started going to the gym, I’m on track to graduate early, and I’m even gonna get my drivers license soon. By the time I’m 17 my life will be better, but I just realized it’ll be the same even after doing all of that. My school life hasn’t changed at all I’m still lonely. I mean I have one friend but we mainly only play games together when he has nothing else to do, all while he talks to me about how he goes to functions with his multiple friends to drink or do whatever. Meanwhile I sit in my room all day doing nothing but doom scroll on TikTok or sleep for hours at a time. At the very least I wanted a gf but if I can’t make friends then idk how I expected to get a gf at all. School gave me nothing but bad memories. It also made me think about what I wanna do with my life, and I couldn’t think of anything at all. I mean I really don’t wanna be alone, I just want one actual friend whether it’s a boy or girl, or a lover. I don’t know about that though, I can’t keep a convo going for more than a minute and I sound like an Npc whenever I try to talk to someone or it’s the other way around. I feel like it’ll be like this forever. I just don’t know what to do. Maybe I’ll be alone for the rest of my life, only thing I can do is learn how to love with it, even if I don’t want to.
