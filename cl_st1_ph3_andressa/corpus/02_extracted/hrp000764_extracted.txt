Okay, so I'm super introverted, I don't really have any friends, plus I have a disability-----nevertheless, I've had some Okcupid hookups, but there's never been another human being who was in love with me. Or even someone who would say "yep, this dude is my boyfriend" and introduce me as such to anyone she knows. I'm always the dude who's the guy you pretend to like because you want to make your ex-boyfriend  jealous or whatever. If she is acting like she likes me, it's because she wants me to think she likes me, but it's not because she actually likes me. 

I really think that's pretty much how it's going to be forever. Have any other people had a similar experience?
