How precious is a person? This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I never knew before.
Elementary school. Middle school. High school. College. Military. Work. People were always there. Stressed together. Laughed together. Cried together. I took it for granted.
Then I got older. And they started disappearing.
I'm running a startup alone now. Can't afford to hire anyone yet. It's been 6 months like this.
I'm learning how important people are.
Go outside and people are everywhere. Streets are full of them. But how many of them can I actually talk to? Really talk to? Almost none.
I want to tell my story. I want to hear someone else's story. Such a simple thing. But it's impossibly hard.
I could walk up to someone right now and start talking. But will they listen? I don't want to talk into empty air.
This basic thing, listening to someone, then sharing your own story, feels so rare now. So precious.
Is loneliness poison or medicine? I still don't know.

Someone said 
The most cruel thing you can do to a person is let them talk alone.
So listen to someone. You might be saving a life.
