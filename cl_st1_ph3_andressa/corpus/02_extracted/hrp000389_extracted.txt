I am so alone. I live my entire life in my head constantly thinking. I have conversions in my head so much sometimes it comes out of my mouth without realizing. I see so many people enjoying time with each other and when I see it I honestly don't know how to feel. 
I feel like an alien or something cause I know what people feel. I know what brings about their feelings and their reactions but I don't understand it. I don't understand anyone, I barely understand myself. I feel lost in my own mind most of the time. 
I fake most of my feelings and reactions to things so people don't realize how different I really truly am. These days the only true things I feel are anger at myself, my existence, and frustration. I wish I could find anyone who understands me.
