Hello, I don't know what to say, but my friends don't love me anymore, even though I asked for forgiveness and they agreed. Now they hardly speak to me. I love them, but I don't know if they love me back. I don't want to forget them, and I can't let them go. I really love them and want to be their best friend again. It was a mistake on my part. No, I'm not an angel; I'm human, and I make mistakes. I'm sorry again. I don't know what to call this—is it humiliation, love, or blind attachment? But deep down, I love them, and I don't want to forget them.
