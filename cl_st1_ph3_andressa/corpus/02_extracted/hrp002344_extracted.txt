Has anyone without any friends succeeded in finding friends? I feel worried I’ll be perpetually alone and have no one. I’ve tried to make lasting friendships for a while but it hasn’t worked out. I hung out with random people I met in groups in my city but they didn’t stay in contact with me. Both were in relationships and it’s like they valued that more than being friends. I feel embarrassed of my loneliness so it’s hard to even reach out and be vulnerable. So many people are trash and just don’t care. I’ve been bullied by people in the past and it still affects me today and it’s like where are the nice people who actually have feelings, integrity, and want to do good in the world? 😔
