I just wanted to know that why was I experiencing these things. Firstly, I always think that there is a void that I'm falling in. Even when there are so many people, friends or I'm with my family. Secondly, I get lonely and zone out. Sometimes I want to be, other times, it just changes. I get adapted to change, but I think that I'm always carrying cracks with me. I've never broken a bone(Touchwood). There is a broken bone theory which I think is not true. The theory states that you never had a broken bone because a guardian angel is protecting you or you never broke a bone because you're mentally broken. But sometimes, there are moments where I think that the second one is true for me. Any answer to this?
