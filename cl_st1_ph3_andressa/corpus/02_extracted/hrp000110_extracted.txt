Hi!

I'm currently going through a separation at the moment, and feeling a bit (understatement) lonely. Just wanted to see if anyone wanted to chat. Probably a bit of distraction and a bit of venting. I know that sounds like the dream to listen to :p

Based in GMT+10, but happy to chat to anyone, anywhere.
