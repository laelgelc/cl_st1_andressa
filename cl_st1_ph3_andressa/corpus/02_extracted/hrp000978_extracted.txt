I don't expect help or answers, I just needed to record somewhere that I existed. My entire life I have been invisible, ignored and alone. I've reached a point where I don't know if I want to be saved or if I just want to rest. I have no happy memories, real friends or family. If anyone reads this...even if they don't respond, thanks for seeing me for a moment
