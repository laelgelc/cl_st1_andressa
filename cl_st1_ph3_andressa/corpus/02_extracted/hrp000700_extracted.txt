I am 22, Will be 23 next month. 

I hate people who do better than me. I'm lonely. 

Life is shite. Back in high school I looked at all the students who behaved like pricks and used to think 

"Haha they'll be useless down and outs when they grow older" 

They're now the ones with girlfriends, Some with children, A very select few even have houses. 

And that isn't fair. I'm bitter and furious. I have no future. No friends no girlfriend no children no house no fuck all. 

Me. I'm the one who didn't behave like a child in school and I'm the one who ends up like this. Me. I don't deserve this. I want a life. I'm going to grow old and bitter because I'm witnessing everyone I know outshine me in every way. 

I have a cousin. Bro's 5 years YOUNGER than me. He has a hot girlfriend. That's not fair, I'm older than you. I deserve a girlfriend. Not you, Me. 

All the fucking good for nothing pieces of shite who behaved like pillocks get to live a better life than me who was a sensible and respectful person in school. TELL ME HOW THAT'S FUCKING FAIR!?

My dad is the only one supporting me but when he retires or God forbid dies, I am FUCKED. I will be jobless, Cashless and thus will result in me being homeless. 

I DESERVE SUCCESS NOT THEM
