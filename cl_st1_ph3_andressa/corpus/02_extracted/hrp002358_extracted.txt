Genuinely I am always alone. I don’t have a single friend, not even one. I also basically have no family as well. I only have my mother who doesn’t even acknowledge me or try to talk to me. I’m so miserable and feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t have anyone. I try to distract myself and try to do something I enjoy, but nothing is enjoyable. I’m so extremely miserable and I’ve ran out of ideas. I can’t keep living like this cuz it’s too awful, but I don’t know what I could possibly do. So if someone on here can even relate the tiniest bit, what do you guys do in your everyday life? How do you get through your day?
