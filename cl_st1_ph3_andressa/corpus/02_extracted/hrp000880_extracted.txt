I have a rare situations which make me cannot be in any form of relationship. I cant be in a relationship because of my physical issues. I dont think it is fair to someone to have this issue fall into their lap. When I found out I am not like all others it was very devastating. I was only 13 at that time and I dont know what to do or so... but in the end i decided not to be in any relationship. Now I am 22. I am craving for physical and emotional relationship but the thought of cant have it literally make me so devastated. Everytime I see someone who is i have an interest i had to shut my thoughts.

Recently, I had the chance to have a friendship with a person. I was drawn to them. I think that person also likes me. I am keep pulling away tho. I dont think it is fair for them. I wish them happiness and the same time, the thought of moving from them is making me sad. I dont know how to explain it. I know that I dont deserve those things as a person of this situation. I have been controlling mu desires for too long. At some point it was so hard for me contain. 

In the end, I too a person yeah, maybe its meant to be... I know the cons of relationship where people choose selfishness. I dont want to put anyone in that situation. I wont do it. Atleast i am being true to myself. 

From the time of my childhood i know that happiness is not bestowed to all people. Now i understand that in that circle i am also in it...

Cant talk to anyone about this issue... have to shut my mouth and keep my head down. Just had to express what I feel thoo. Maybe someone can give some tips on how to cope with this situation.  Crying in solace and weeping inside the only thing I can do and I have been doing all these times... it will continue... 

Thx for your time
