I have no social life, no one to really talk to. I’m chatty with people at work but it’s just civil. There’s no real friendships. I’m used by men whenever I feel they might like me, it never works I get played. I have pretty much no one, no life. It’s getting me so down and depressed that my work is struggling and my anxiety is sky high. 
29, England (west mids) would love to get to know more people and have regular conversation. Encourage and support each other etc
