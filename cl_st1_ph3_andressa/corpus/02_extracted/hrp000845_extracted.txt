I guess I’m not sure if I’m even looking for another person to say it. It doesn’t spark much for me besides reminding me of how I had to embarrassingly try to bring up my birthday to a friend(maybe he’s using me?/related-ish)

My whole day felt numb. You get a notification and get excited maybe remembers but it’s all the same each day. Then you overshare online just to have it documented that it’s your birthday and it feels weird and somber to have only strangers be the ones to do it, but not unprompted either.

I miss the one year I didn’t have to wish for friends. Because they were there celebrating with me.
