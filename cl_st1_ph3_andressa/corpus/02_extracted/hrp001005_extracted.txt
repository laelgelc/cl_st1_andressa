I had a psychotic break and my two best friends who lived with us now will only interact with me in official caretaker capacity, within office hours. Outside of that they treat me like I don't exist. Won't talk to me in the hall or like over text or something even when my parents get really intense just nothing. I feel like I'm not a good person anymore because I lost their friendship and because of how they treat me. Then there's my parents. To be fair they've always been abusive, but it's gotten so much more intense since they had to move in with all of us and they always take the girls' side, only come in to emotionally stress vomit on me then leave, and never come in to sit with me or like watch something of mine (i'm bedbound and they have a lifelong record of never and i mean never watching any media of mine no matter how short or how much better it would've made me feel it's only their shows). Then when they do come in, they're so mean. The scream at me and then tell me it's because I was lecturing them. "Lecturing" yesterday, was me vomiting neon yellow, angry, undigested stomach contents and acid into a pot and my father completely ignoring me and just having fun with the cat. And I don't mean like he had an arm on me or was being comforting, I mean like I wasn't even there. Just like always. Like even when I'm sick as a dog and trying not to aspirate vomit they find reasons to scream at me. I have literally *no one.* And as  a disabled person that physically needs other people to survive this is like the worst possible situation. It just makes me feel like I must be a bad person? Because if I'm not a bad person then why are things like this happening? What do you do as an adult that needs other people, when there are no other people?
