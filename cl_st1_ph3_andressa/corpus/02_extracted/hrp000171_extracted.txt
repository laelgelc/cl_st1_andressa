Hi, I am an 18 year old guy ad I moved out from my parents house 1 month ago to study in a uni. I left behind all my friends since I came alone because I am the only one of the group who went to study. So now I am in a new city where I do not know anyone, except for the two guys I met at uni. The thing is that the loneliness is kinda kicking in me, the two guys that I met are cool but is not like we hang out of uni or nothing and to be honest we do not have that much in common. I feel like I do not have a lot in common with all the people in my carreer, at least not enough to hang out or anything like that, I guess that the fact that I am practically the only guy there is a big influence to that feeling. Anyway, what worries me the most is that I do not feel like I am doing what an 18 year old should do, and I am very aware that I am only going to be 18 once. Since I am sharing my feelings I thing that a big component to this way I feel is the fact that I am still a virging, which is not the usual scenario to my age. I don't even think that being a virgin at my age is that weird but since I am in a new city alone that sentiment is making me feel pretty bad because that adds to my feeling of 'not doing what a young person should do". I thought about going to a psychologist but I do not even know how could a professional help me with this. If someone could tell give me advice or whatever that would be helpful. Thank you!
