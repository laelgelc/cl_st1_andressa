On Friday I’ll be turning 38. I have no birthday plans, no trips, dinners, or hopes for flowers or a day unlike any other.

For the second year of my life I won’t be single, but my partner is not that great. He doesn’t know my favorite color, my favorite flower, or the fact that I don’t like peanut butter and chocolate together. I could give him a detailed list of my likes and dislikes (honestly, I did at Christmas) and he still gets it completely wrong, and yet he’s my only friend. He only adds to the loneliness.

I miss having friends, real, true friends who are excited to celebrate me. Who know that I would rather sit at home with take out and a Harry Potter marathon in sweats and cozy blankets than dressing up and going out to bars. Friends that know me forwards and backwards. Friends to have coffee dates with and laugh with and go horseback riding with. Friends that think my spontaneous day-trips to ghost towns are endearing and praise me as the “perfect date.”

I lost my friends many years ago as they married and I fell into a deep depression, fell into an abusive relationship and subsequent psychotic break that friendships could not withstand, and used every ounce of energy to raise my two children that were the product of that relationship. I split from my friends and was forced to find myself as a mother and sole provider. Honestly, the loneliness wasn’t so bad… until my kids grew older and found their own friends… and I realized as I age myself… I’m soon to be completely alone as the milestones continue.

I dream of connection. I am so afraid to open up again, but maybe it’s time… but where do you even start?
