I’m 36 and have chosen to live this lifestyle. A few years back I used to hang out with a group of friends mostly known each other from high school and friend of a friend things. At the time I would say that we where all on different tracks in life. Some getting their life together, others getting married things such as that. The two couples of the group started having kids and doing different things or going on activities that I really didn’t care for. As I really don’t like kids. 

During the time we where close or we always did things was pretty much every weekend and it was always the same drink, get pissed drunk do dumb shit. At the time I was more focused on my 2 jobs and other hobbies. The hobbies I had none in this group would enjoy or participate in them. So slowly I just got tired of hanging out and pretty much ghosted them and I have no regret doing it and have a feeling of relief of not having to say no to hang out. 

Well 2 weeks ago one of them asked me to be a groomsmen in the wedding and at first I said yes but now having second thoughts. What would you do ? 
I have friends that I hang out and just do certain things withs that we both enjoy but it’s more of a something we have in common than anything else.
