 At my age I would have never thought I would be alone for so long. Growing up in a broken home and never felt love from my parents just abuse was rough. I had to learn a lot on my own.  Thinking I knew how turned to be no good 3 failed marriages no kids .  Friends who were friends were not and the ones who were true past away.  I have trust issues been trying to work on it.  At night when I’m getting ready for bed it hits me the hardest.   I do go anywhere because my social skills suck and afraid to approach because rejection makes me shell up.  I’m tired of crying inside.
