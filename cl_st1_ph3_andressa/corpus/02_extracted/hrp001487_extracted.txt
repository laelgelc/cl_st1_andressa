I feel physically sick from the constant torment of feeling lonely.

Ive been trying to cope for days
And I feel like my body is caving in from not getting much peace from this.

I really need to chat to someone here on reddit tonight
Cause I dont know what to do
Its so painful
Ive had to self medicate with prescription meds from my doctor, that I use in emergencies, in order to sleep but also block my lonely feelings
Cause i cant cope

Ps: dont worry about my prescription meds, im in control of it, but its not fun to feel stuck and rely on it for even a few days
