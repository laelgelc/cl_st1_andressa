I’m only 20f. After my first break up I’ve been feeling extremely lonely and disposable. 

I don’t even want just a boyfriend but a husband. A loving husband who will stay with me despite my flaws and I’ll do the same for him. Who ever he is. I don’t know if he exists but deep down I hope so. 

Having a small family of my own would mean so much to me. I would also like to be a mother one day. I think I would be a good mom despite my struggles with depression and anxiety. 

I’m not a sociable person. I’m very introverted lol and it’s got me thinking if im even worthy of being loved. I’m too quiet. I also don’t have close friends.

I’ve been alone my whole life. So alone that sometimes I wish I could disappear forever.

Wondering if anyone can relate.
