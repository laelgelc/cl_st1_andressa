I’m 22 and I recently moved to a new city for work.

Back home, I had a lot of friends—from school, college, and my hometown—people I genuinely enjoyed spending time with. Hanging out always felt easy and normal.

But after coming here, I’ve started feeling this strange loneliness from inside. Since here 

Earlier, I never really thought much about it. Maybe I wasn’t mature enough to understand what I needed emotionally, or maybe because I was too occupied with so called hangout friends I have. But now it’s hitting me.

I feel this emptiness… and the truth is, even the people I call my friends right now—the ones from school and college—I don’t think I have that level of closeness with them. I don’t feel like I can truly open up, share what I’m going through, or turn to them when I’m feeling low.

And I know part of it is because of me too. I’m not someone who opens up easily. I keep things inside, and maybe that’s one reason I’ve never really had that one person in my life who feels like a safe space.

Sometimes when I scroll through social media and see people tagging their “besties,” or calling someone their “brother from another mother,” it honestly hurts. I feel this emptiness pinching at my heart… and I even feel jealous, not in a bad way, but because I wish I had something like that too.

I don’t even know what I’m looking for here… I just wanted to put it into words...
