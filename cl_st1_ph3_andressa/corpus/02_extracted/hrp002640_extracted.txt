(I'm happy, this is not a self-loathing post)

I just read the post ["Loner" Does not Mean "Lonely"](https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/qewq4n/loner_does_not_mean_lonely/). The first article [‘Loners’ aren’t always lonely](https://theorion.com/76276/opinion/loners-arent-always-lonely/) didn't resonate with me. I'm closer to the person that lives with his mom stereotype.

The second article [Are You A Loner, Introvert, or Both?](https://solitarybeast.com/blog/are-you-a-loner-an-introvert-or-both) proved to me that I'm a loner but not a confident one!

> So most loners are introverts, introverts are not necessarily loners. For example, the loner is defined as “avoiding the company of others” , while introverts can have close friendships with a small group of people. 

I'm a loner. Though not a confident one which makes me wonder sometimes what the hell is going on with me

> On the other hand, loners typically feel comfortable engaging in the outside world, albeit alone. Loners have a strong desire to do as they please. Things like going hiking, eating in restaurants, attending movies, or shopping are no problem for the typical loner.

I have anxiety doing most of those things. Well, only the restaurant thing. I so go to movies and run. 

I don't think I'm a forced loner!

There are a lot of people, probably teens, on the web that protests a  lot of how amazing it is to be alone because people are stupid and don't know how to value genuine people. I'm not like that, I don't think like that. I wasn't really forced into becoming a loner, yet I don't remember ever not being a loner - apart from as a kid.

My sister isn't a loner, she has friends and on and she said I was brave in going for runs alone, she'd never do it, it feels strange. I'm exactly like that with going to restaurants alone, I had immense anxiety when I first went to a museum, or the cinema alone but now I feel at home in those spaces. I felt anxiety when I started to learn to swim as an adult alone...

The article says "If they can’t find peace with their situation, these forced loners may sink into isolation and depression." - I am not in danger of depression, maybe isolation.
