…after they haven’t responded for a long time to my messages.  
I am that kind of person, who will just stay. I didn’t know you’re supposed to leave people after some time, or whatever. If I know someone from long time ago, I still want to communicate.  
Well… No more. It was kinda a drain to my mind. I was thinking about everyone from the past. And since the start of this year, I’ve decided no more.  
I am gonna continue to be in touch with the handful of the people I am in touch, however low-intensity, but I am leaving those ungrateful for what we had back in the past.  
It is sad, to be honest. That people are like this. I’ve always operated in this state of mind, that you just don’t leave. If we were friends 17 years ago, we can still be friends. But apparently, I am not even worth the answer.  
Am I alone? Technically…no. Practically? Yeah. Because: the most words I have spoken, was a month ago with my therapist. How many words did I say to…„friends“? That would be a grand total of fuckin’ 0. I talk to my therapist more than to anyone else. I like her, and this friday I have another apointment, I’m looking forward to it, but god damn, is this sad or what…  
Statistics like this is a powerful thing.
