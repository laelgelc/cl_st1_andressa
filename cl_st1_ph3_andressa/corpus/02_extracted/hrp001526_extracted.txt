I just realized that I have been completely lonely for over a year. I’m taking a gap year after graduate degree. No job and belong to no group is scary. My family is a disaster, would be a whole other topic. I crave someone to take care of me right now, and I can’t go to them (my family). I can contact my friends for a lunch, but that won’t solve the problem. I feel as if there’s no one I can be honest with about how dark I feel about my situation. I should be starting to work to improve my situation, but it upsets me that there’s no job I’m interested in and I absolutely don’t feel I can enjoy the environment like others around me. I feel it’s me, would be another topic too, but I can’t resist the feeling.

When I’m alone at home, I start to cry thinking about all this. Multiple times a day. One moment I feel severely depressed, then I feel better by relaxing, and then the depression kicks in again. It’s exhausting. If I have someone who would be around me 247 things would be a lot better. But I don’t have any peer. How can I truly improve my situation?
