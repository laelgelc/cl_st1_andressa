I dont even have any idea where to start. Where do I find people willing to talk to me? I live in a middle-of-nowhere, there are no hobby clubs, I'm beyond broke and because of that scared to even start dating, and I cant find any friends online to play and talk with. I dont like feeling desperate, I like being positive, but I just cant anymore. I already feel calm about... doing a thing. I still do live with family and they are... not a nice influence, to say it mildly.

I dont even know how to rant in there right now. I dont even feel what I've just wrote. I just feel so lost, so lonely. I dont think I'll be able to keep going long like that. What do I even do?
