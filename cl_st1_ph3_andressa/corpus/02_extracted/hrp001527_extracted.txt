A couple years ago I had found love for the first time but didn’t realize until it was too late. Almost a year later I was so desperate for afection that I decided to accept whoever became interested in me next and ended up in a horrible (yet thankfully short-lived) relationship with someone I didn’t even like that much and it taught me to not lower my bar so much. 
A year or so later I fell for an old friend (with whom I was loosing touch) but I never quite knew if my feelings were true or if I was forcing myself into that situation because I was actually afraid of being alone. That dubt kept me from making big steps and nothing truly happened between us, but now I see that the second case was true and my feelings weren’t completely real.
Nowadays I have realised and embraced two important truths: NEVER let fear, uncertainty or despair guide my choices, and no matter how hard things get DON’T settle for a relationship that will obviously do more harm than good. 
After almost a year I have been alone and a bit lonely but yet ok(-ish) with my love life, but there’s one thing I have been fearing for a while now, not wether or not someone will love me like all those years ago, but rather will I even feel anything for anyone again? These last couple years have been rough and my love life hasn’t quite helped, so I kind of feel like my brain has overridden my heart and I have been thinking my emotions rather than feeling them (I know, it sounds pretty weird), and I fear I might not be able to go back and properly FEEL again.
