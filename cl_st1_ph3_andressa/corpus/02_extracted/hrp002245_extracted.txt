Has anyone accepted the fact that they are inherently completely alone? Romantically, platonically etc. Even when I am with my absolute most favourite people who give me so much love I can’t help but look away into the distance and still feel the absolute void that I am alone and may feel this depth of loneliness as long as I live, regardless of the love or lack there of that I receive. Can anyone relate?
