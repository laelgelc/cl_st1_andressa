It’s been a while since I’ve hung out with anyone. I’ve come across some cool people on here but I wish I’d meet people from nyc who were down to chat and hangout but not rn only when the weather gets better. Some of the online friends I have live in further parts of ny so I never get to see em which is why I spend most of my time in the house cause there’s really no point in going out if I have no one to hang with. Ik some people will being happy comes from within but I’ve already tried that and it’s gotten me nowhere.
