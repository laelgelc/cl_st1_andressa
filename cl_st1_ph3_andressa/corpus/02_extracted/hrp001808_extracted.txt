I was thinking about how we form connections, about how we attach to people. If chemicals secreted by our brains dictate our behaviour, what's real, how much free will do we actually have, what's actually worth pursuing? It's not like I didn't know this before, I just didn't really question it before.

How do we even define 'real'? If we can learn to cope with loneliness will romantic connections even have a point? Will any relationships besides utility ones have any meaning?

I think this is where people usually bring the soul into the discussion, and spirituality stuff in general. I'm just unsure what's the point in all of this, and social connections just feels like coping, a loop of validating our insecurities and needing validation from others, just to satisfy our urges. 

I would appreciate any insights on this
