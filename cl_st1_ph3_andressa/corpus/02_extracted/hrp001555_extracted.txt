so I have nothing to do real control over my life, and it seems like whatever i do, my mom gets mad at me, using last night as an example, my mom wanted to take my phone away due to the fact that I use it lots, but that’s because I don’t really have anything else I can do, so she decided to forcibly take, causing me to bleed in several spots, and there’s nothing I can do anymore cause I’m limited to like, 2 hours a day, would it just be best to not give it back, because being online is the only way to calm myself because there are people who want to help me, and listening to music. I can‘t take it much more.
