By this I mean that you don’t text anyone, you don’t meet up with anyone, you have no one to spend New Year’s Eve with, no one wishes you a happy birthday… I’ve been in this situation for two years.

I kind of messed up my life at the age of 26, but I always had one close friend (or so I thought), whom I had known for 10 years. It was someone who was interested in the same things as me and with whom I had a great time. Unfortunately, that person was toxic, and after an argument two years ago, the contact ended.

For two years now, I literally haven’t had any friends. I don’t message anyone on Messenger or WhatsApp, and my only contact is with my family. I’m currently in my final year of high school at an adult education school (a special school for people who didn’t finish high school at the usual time), and I’m in a class where most people already knew each other from previous years (over several years I’ve been at this school three times — twice I dropped out after completing a year, and now I’m here for the third time).

I can’t form connections with anyone, and even when I see that someone is talking to me and I try to respond, I can tell from their facial expression that they’re not interested in me, so I withdraw.

Is anyone else in a similar situation, without friends? On the one hand, I’m glad I don’t have toxic people around me, but on the other hand, the thought that aside from trips with my family I just sit at home really gets to me.
