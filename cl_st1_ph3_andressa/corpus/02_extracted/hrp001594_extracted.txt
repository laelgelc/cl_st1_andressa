friend of my soul, where are you, the girl who feels the same as me, who doesn't fit in, the one who isn't accepted, the one who thinks she's different, I know you exist somewhere in the world. and most likely you are looking for the same friendship as me and you think the same as me and you are longing for someone to accept you and someone to understand you.
