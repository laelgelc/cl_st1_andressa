I know we can't really control when we die and I just feel stupid knowing that if I were to die soon randomly it would be soo darn embarassing because even though I'm an adult, I have done nothing in life. My life is boring, which is fine. But at the end of the day, it's just a super embarassing way to live. It'll probably be embarassing for the people who'd attend the funeral too, which would be my parents, brother and grandparents. I wish I'd done something worthy of life.
Edit: I'd like to thank all four of you who replied, it genuinely made me feel better :)
