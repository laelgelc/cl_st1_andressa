Just came from visiting my grandpa in the hospital. He's not doing well but I realized I really have no one to turn to. I'm there dealing with it alone like I've always been in my life.

How sad right? No girlfriend, no friends, not much family. No one visits him but my mom and I. Will this be my fate too?
