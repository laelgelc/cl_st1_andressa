I cut off both my friends a few days ago due to constant disrespect and just having different values/POVs in life. I feel good about the fact that I stood up for myself and got it all out, but there's a creeping sense of loneliness inside me now. Ig I'll go out to some events and stuff and try to meet some folks, but I feel like I've always got this hole inside me that no one can fill, like I'm always looking for something, this has just amplified it.
