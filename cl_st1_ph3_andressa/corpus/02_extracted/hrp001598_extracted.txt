Good evening everyone. I'm curious how other people become content with the loneliness. Specifically romantically. I'm having an incredibly tough time accepting the fact that I won't have another romantic partner in my life after my last one. How do I simply accept that and move on? It feels like that is a huge part of being human and being fulfilled especially because I have no real family. Thanks for any advice.
