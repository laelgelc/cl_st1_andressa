Hey so Chrismas was one of my favorite holidays when I was a kid, but now it isn't anymore. Sinds my mom got sick someone has to take care of her and that person is me (f17). The moment my family realized she needs to be taken care of they left, no contact, no "hi how are you" nothing. The left without looking back. Even on Christmas time they don't do anything. But now I want to try and reach out for someone my age who would wanna talk and maybe be friends. Everywhere i go i am alone, no one's first choise, or forgotten about. I am from Belgium 🇧🇪 and if you are from the same country as me maybe if you want we can do something together.
