I am a (34m) , married and have good friends. Maybe I am just broken but no matter what I feel like the lonelyness seeps in. I am sure people have heard this saying a million times , the whole I could be in a room of people and still feel the crippling lonelyness. I am not sure how people combat this , yes also trying to find a therapist. Maybe just had to vent this out into the universe but maybe not alone on this feeling ?
