Close up of this week. 

1 - accepted the fact I suck even as a fuck friend, not just as a life partner

2 - I hate my mom, I probably won't visit her anytime soon

3 - the whole city is more or less empty throughout the day, people get outdoor in evenings which doesn't fit me cos I have different schedule with my preschoolers

4 - I cut off some people from communication, "friends" with whom my kid was socialising, they got to my ex's side

I'm left with my rent lady who seems a bit distancing now. She's probably suspicious after I confessed I get myself drunk each weekend. 

New rent lady acts as a passive aggressive bitch.

I have my ex friend back to whom I can't count on for going out cos she's a make up person and I'm a tomboy. 

I feel uncomfortable around people wherever I go. 

Earth, suck me up back inside.
