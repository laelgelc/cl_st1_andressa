I(18f) haven't seen my friends in around 8 months, I'm far from being an introvert but plans always fall through and since I'm in a big friend group there's always someone who's busy so we can't hang. I don't have a job so I don't go out and when I do its to go to Cegep which I have a horrible schedule for and I don't know anyone in my classes and I'm lowk failing if I don't spend all my weekends working on projects so when it starts again I'm going to have to wait until the next end of semester to have any time to potentially see my friends and I'll probably have given up by then coz im lowk going insane, how do I fix this??
