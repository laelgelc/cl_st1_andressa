(23m) Hello, it’s now been since June 29th, 2025 that I’ve separated from my partner of 7 years, well..would’ve been 7 this February 4th… Not sure to really begin? I’ve learned a lot about myself these last few months.. bettering & worsening in some ways but pulling through! I wish I could go back in time & do things right. But life is life I suppose. What’s crazy is I’ve tried to move on when I’ve felt comfortable enough, but I still find myself reminiscing, I guess I’m still not healed? I still find myself having that bit of hope & faith that we will bounce back but I don’t know. Not sure where I’m going with this, I don’t talk to very much people so getting this out tonight especially is a bit relieving..
