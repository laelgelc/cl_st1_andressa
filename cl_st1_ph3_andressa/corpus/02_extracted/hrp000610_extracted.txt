I realised recently while watching the Simpsons that Moe still tries to make an effort not to come off as depressed as he really is.. he has “friends” or at least regular customers to talk to (something I do not have). A thought occurred to me, it’s interesting that Moe hasn’t developed serious alcohol / drug problems himself and simply tries to manage his crippling emotional problems himself - alone.
