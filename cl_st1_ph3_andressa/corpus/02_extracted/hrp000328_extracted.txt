Maybe this is the wrong sub to be posting in. I don’t know. But I have felt alone and loveless for over a year now and I no longer want to do anything about it.

I’ve tried to so many times to make friends. I swallow my anxiety and talk to strangers at work all the time. But today, one of my co-workers made a joke about “how much I talk” and how “I’ve never been silent in my life.” And it destroyed me. This happens every single time. I know I talk a lot. And I know now that I talk a lot because I am longing for connection and socialization with anyone but myself. But I just don’t gaf anymore. 

I also work another job as a mental health therapist. All day long I tell people to connect with themselves and encourage them to unlock their own potential. I try to give them hope while I have none. I have a therapist of my own that I am working on things with but I feel so much shame.

There are some days that are better than others. But today was not one of those days. Ever since my break up almost two years ago now, I haven’t felt truly happy or excited about anything. That was the straw that broke the camels back I think.

I tried to move on to a new person and take my time and it’s still not working out. If I am being honest I don’t think she wants to be around me anymore and I don’t blame her. Who would want to be around someone who is depressed and can barely take care of themselves. 

I just want to be cared for, in any capacity. But at the same time I don’t think I know how to do the same, consistently for others. I think my past haunts me and makes me ruin my relationships. Maybe being alone is what’s best for me.
