The only active friend I have right now is my boyfriend, and people really just generally ignore my offers of friendship (I promise you, I'm not weird, err, in a bad way). I think people just generally think of me as intimidating since I don't initiate conversation much. I also tend to stick with the people I already know, but something bad happened to my college friend group of four people, and well, we're not friends anymore and am left with my boyfriend as the only person I can actually talk to.

Am I oversharing? Idrk. Sorry. But, um, well, if you want a friend, maybe we can be friends?
