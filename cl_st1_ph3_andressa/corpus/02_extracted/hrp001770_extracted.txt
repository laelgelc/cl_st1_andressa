I (25F) don't really know how to comprehend this situation I'm in. 

My entire life basically blew up recently. Firstly, my mental health went extremely downhill. I had a huge episode of OCD or maybe anxiety (?) that has completely taken all my joy away from me. None of my hobbies appeal to me anymore. And I have also considered "exiting". Secondly, I just finished college and have somehow found myself a NEET with no prospects, mobility or social skills. This makes everyday so difficult and torturous. 

Now, the relevant aspect to this sub is that I'm also feeling utterly lonely. My few friends are either (understandably) busy or tired of supporting me. Sometimes I even take the initiative to avoid them because I'm ashamed of who I have become. This is a big problem because I feel like I need people and want them around. I get so sad when there's no one to even talk to. But how, on god's green earth, do I reconcile the urgent need for company with the fact that I really need to work on myself to be worthy of such company? How can I say I want people around me when everyone currently deserves better?

I think there is a loooong list of things. Need to go to therapy at long last. Need to get a job somehow. Need to do a hundred more things probably.. I just... have so much to do, and I don't know how I'll do it all alone.
