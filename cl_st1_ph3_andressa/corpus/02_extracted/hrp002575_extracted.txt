Hello,

most of you have a family to go to on christmas I guess (and in the US thankgsiving. Tomorrow I think?) but I was wonderng how you´re going to spend new year for example.

I for my part will have a date with an assortment of cheeses, no wine (cause I am on 1000 meds right now) and something sweet and more expensive than usual for an end. I´m going to meditate as I do each year, watch creepy youtube videos and read a bit and watch the fireworks in case I am still awake then. A perfect end for a day. :)

So what are your plans?
