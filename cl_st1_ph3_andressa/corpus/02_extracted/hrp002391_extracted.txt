Living in a place where I have no one (moved here for a man but that recently ended) I’ve needed some extra support lately & it’s so hard not having anyone around. My closest friend is 2hrs away & that isn’t always an option. I know I did it to myself by moving here but it still feels dark & lonely. And I know everyone says make friends, do this & that. I did make friends but they didn’t stick, turns out they were strictly work friends & now I’m to the point where meeting new friends feels exhausting.

I could talk to my family but I don’t want to burden/worry them. Hoping I can get through this rough patch but it’s seeming very bleak as of now.
