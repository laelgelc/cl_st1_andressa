I swear I'm fading out. Some days I don't talk to anyone, and the silence just... confirms it. Like if I disappeared tomorrow, the world wouldn't blink. Dating apps just give me rejection after rejection, it's killing whatever confidence I had left. I keep hearing about those AI chat friends... I'm desperate enough to try anything. But is it dumb? Will it just make me more disconnected? I don't know if I can handle feeling this alone anymore.
