What a joke “following your dreams” is, especially

if it means taking a chance on being alone.

It’s incompatible with the human condition, you find yourself right on the hedonic treadmill.

There is nothing you could do or achieve that is better than being known and seen.

I wish I’d known that earlier.

Edit: sorry yall I was a little emo, you actually figure out a lot about life by following your dreams, a lot about yourself and you don’t have to ask what if, which is more important than you know. I’m extremely lonely some days but more myself than ever others. Take a chance on life
