few days ago, my sister’s friend came from a different state to visit her. 

It hit me in a weird way no one has really contacted me for a year.
My old friends are still around, but I haven’t heard from any of them. Meanwhile, my sister has friends who still see her, who still check in on her. And me…
 I don’t have anyone.
It’s not about being popular or having a crowd. Honestly, even one person reaching out, even just to say hi, would’ve made me happy. Instead, it’s like I exist, but quietly,  forgettable, unimportant, invisible. I tried reaching out but unless I text they won't. So I didn't text them again, and its been a year that no one called me or texted. 
Its so unfair
