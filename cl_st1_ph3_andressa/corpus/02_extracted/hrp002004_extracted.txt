I’ve always tried to handle my own life. Refuse to play the victim. But last night during the snowstorm I was crying all night and couldn’t figure out why… until I realized I’ve been lonely for so long and just hiding it.

Making friends feels impossible. Everyone says it’s hard to make friends, but then they don’t open up at all. When I try to connect, they pull away and I just feel pushed aside.

I’ve been keeping myself busy with work and random side stuff to ignore it, but being real about it actually feels… good just to admit the truth on how I’m feeling.
