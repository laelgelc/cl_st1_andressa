The loneliness is overwhelming. I can be with a huge crowd of people who are smiley and lively and it does nothing for me. Small talk, talking about the weather, drinking, shouting etc, no thanks.  I like deep thinkers and would rather have one reliable caring friend like that. Loneliness to me is about not having som,eone you click with and who really cares about you. If you died would they care, would they come to your funeral, would they miss you? Different things contribute to situations. In my case I have chronic illness for life which makes it hard for me to get out and meet people.  I live with a man who is extremely honest and nice, but he has aspergers, he is not good at verbal or emotional communication or understanding, he could sit and read a book all long day after day and wonder why you feel neglected or bored. Everyone's situation is different. What is yours?
