I don't like my birthday. Please don't wish me a happy birthday, I'll just tell you part of my story. I don't know why.

It day reminds me that I'm doing nothing in life. All my efforts are either stress/injury, or I'm not even trying.
A couple of days ago, I got a new job. I worked in -15 degrees Celsius on a construction site. It was tough, both mentally and physically, because it was my first job in a year. Before that, I'd worked for a week because work was finished. I felt bad mentally. I see that people aren't bad, but... I just feel bad around 50-year-old men who don't complain, while I'm a whiner in my head... I can't do anything in life.

After that, I've feel nothing, for the last four days. Just fog.
My birthday was a couple of days ago, I even forgot it was mine. My dad and grandma congratulated me.

  I feel like something is clearly wrong in my life. I clearly can't live like normal people.
 The only thing that was even slightly touching was when I was playing Minecraft with a friend... it was very sweet. But unfortunately, that quickly evaporates when I'm practically alone. And then we talked today, and she said we should stop talking at one day in future. I'm not angry or offended. Just fog.
In real life, I have friends, but unfortunately, I can't talk to them about this emptiness. And they can't do anything... there's just nothing. I'm asexual myself, I don't like to be proud of it, I don't like to talk about it in general. I live in Latvia, I'm Russian, Russians are not well-liked here, there's war, I have no homeland, no friends who understand irl.  I'd like to speak Russian, but I have to speak English... Life for me is like an arthouse film, in a foreign language... it seems like something is happening on the screen, but you don't understand anything.  I cry often, but now I feel a deep emptiness from everything that's happening... I don't know why I wrote this
