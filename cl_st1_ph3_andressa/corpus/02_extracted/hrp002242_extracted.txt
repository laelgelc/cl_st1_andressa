How do you spend time when you’re by yourself?

Looking back, what social habits, places, or group moments used to work,  but don’t really exist anymore?

If there were a calm, no-pressure “third space” to meet others, what would make it feel safe, natural, and worth showing up for, what would you imaging it to be like?

Genuinely curious to hear real experiences as we all might feel some sort of loneliness—whether is emotional, social or even existential.
