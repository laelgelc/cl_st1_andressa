I have epilepsy and 99% of the time it's well controlled with meds and I have no seizures.

Last night I had a real bad spell, maybe the worst ever.  I fell flat onto my nose causing it to bleed.  I then kept seizing so bad I had to crawl on the floor like an animal to my bedroom, where I have my medicine (also had to manage to get a glass of water while seizing).  I took my medicine and then just laid there seizing until it took affect.  

It's so brutal, not a person in the world who would know or care.  I'm in my mid 30's, is this really all there is the rest of my life?  More sickness, more loneliness?
