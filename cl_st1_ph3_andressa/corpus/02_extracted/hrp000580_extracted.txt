Hi, I'm a guy under 25, like many here. I created this post to say everything that I can't say to anyone, and to also give others a space where they can talk about what they keep inside, whether they are alone or not. In my case, precisely because I am alone, I found this community and decided to open up.

I suffer a lot from this loneliness. I wish with all my being I could go back, change certain mistakes, fix at least something... but I can't anymore. I lead a shitty life and, looking around, I only see people I knew being successful: some with university, some with work, some simply in life. And then there's me, writing a fucking post on Reddit that maybe no one will read, with a job with excruciating hours and miserable earnings. I'm constantly sad because I'm not building anything and I don't even know what I really want to do.

Maybe I just want someone to talk to and smile like I used to. This morning, on the usual train to work, I saw an old school friend. I felt like crying. She was just as I remembered her, happy, and it unlocked a lot of memories from a time I've tried to forget. At the time I was too stupid and shy, I didn't create real relationships and I made people who didn't deserve it suffer, without even doing it on purpose. I was naive, maybe even a little apathetic.

I tried to improve myself as much as possible, but now… now I'm alone.
