As a personal project I created a first draft of an APP dedicated to supporting people going through a moment of emotional distress (Loneliness, health issue, addiction, trauma, domestic abuse,…) 

The concept is simple, people who are going through a difficult moment can sign-up for free and post their issue. Volunteers will also post their willingness to help and mention specific areas or interests to help. The anonymity and the practical nature of the tool should allow people to find a match with someone creating an opportunity for emotional connection. 

I have named the project LIFT, because that’s what we all need from time to time to get over our hurdles. I don’t know if I am allowed to post the link to the URL here, so I won’t do it. 

But I would really appreciate your thoughts. Have a great day.
