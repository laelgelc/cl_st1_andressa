{Apologies for the cheesy title I couldn't think of a better one.}

As the title suggests, today is my birthday. I’ve been feeling really disillusioned with reality. I hoped I would have accomplished more in my life by now. My birthday has never been a special event. My family is very religious, so we’ve never celebrated my birthday. The most I can expect each year is a text saying, “I’m happy you’re still with us another year.” That’s all. I’m surrounded by people who say they love me, but it all feels very transactional and detached.
