Its no secret that crowds make you feel more lonely but I'm not sure why. I just know when I'm around a sea of people, everyone is laughing, hanging out, I'm a stranger, I feel like just another person in the crowd, it rubs me the wrong way. Afterwards I feel so deflated and unhappy. If I'm in a bookstore and there's like 5 people in there I'm totally fine and content. Its weird how that works.
