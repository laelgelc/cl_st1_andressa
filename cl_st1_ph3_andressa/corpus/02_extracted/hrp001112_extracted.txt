I don't believe there's anyone for me any more.  I tried to talk to lots of women but none of them seems to care. We never click, they never even care to write back/talk back. It's only and only my efforts all the time. I am not extremely ugly, or not extremely idiot. I don't know where is my special person but I am tired of looking for her. Imagining my alternate life if someone at all loved me, is destroying me. Am I really so unlovable?
Am I really that bland no one seems to care about me?
