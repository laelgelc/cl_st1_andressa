It’s so weird to see everyone else go to uni and finish college, with heaps of friends. I had a baby last June, my daughters so so cool despite only being 8 months old. She’s my world, but I find myself completely alone. All the time. My relationship is falling apart I feel I’m days away from losing the person I wanted to marry, he’s become angry and emotionally abusive since we had a baby. He’s not coping well and honestly neither am I. Anyone I used to know has just cut me off, no one my age is interested in being in contact with someone who has a baby. So many people my age think they’re gross, I know I did a few years ago. 
How do I even make friends, I’ve always been the loner edgy kid that eats lunch alone, any people I spoke to in school would tolerate me being around but block me out of conversations and ignore me all the time. 

If there’s anyone here that’s a young parent I’d love to keep in touch. I’m in the UK, but friends around the world could be cool. I’m into art and wanna become a tattoo artist at some point in my life, I play league of legends when I get the chance (honestly maybe once a week at the moment) and really enjoy stupid conversations about things that don’t matter. I really wanna get into using VR chat or discord or something but I can’t afford VR stuff at the moment. I’m just desperate for someone to appreciate me being around and to see me more than just a worn out dead beat young mum who’s life is already over.
