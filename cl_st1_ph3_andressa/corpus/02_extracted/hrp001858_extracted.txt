I started dating this guy in December and he started staying at my place.  Then my friend needed a place to crash so she was staying with me as well.  I was doing great, I was around people and had people to do stuff with.  It was like life had been given back to me.  That was mid December, well mid January that all came crashing down.  The guy pulled away, my friend had to go to rehab and here I am all over again all alone.  I can't stand it.  I suffer from severe depression and all I want is a group of people to be friends with to go out and do stuff with.  My life includes going to work, going home and watching tv, grabbing a bite to eat, showering, going to sleep and then repeat the next day.  This is no life to live.  Anyone else not have many friends and realize how important it is to have them?
