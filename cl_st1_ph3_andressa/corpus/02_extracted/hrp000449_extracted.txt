I am alone. I deal with the occasional loneliness and get through it alright. I’m 59 now and I’m beginning to feel like I will pass on without anyone ever having known me and seen me for who I am. I have three grown children and although we are close, they all have their own very busy lives. I have extended family but no one even remotely close to me.

I haven’t had an easy life and I’ve survived so much that most of the people in my life know nothing about. Sadly, I think they are all too wrapped up in their own lives to connect. I reach out regularly but it all feels superficial. I just really don’t like the idea of dying alone with no one who ever saw all of who I am. I feel like I’ll be easily forgotten. 

I think I just need to come to terms with it because more than likely, it is the path I’m on. If that’s the case, why continue on? What’s the point? I meditate, go to therapy, run, interact with neighbors occasionally etc. and am generally okay. I just am having a hard time seeing the future as anything but bleak, diminishing, and pointless.

Can anyone relate?
