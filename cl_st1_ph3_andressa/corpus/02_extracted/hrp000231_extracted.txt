I just took a bunch of pills and I’m still kinda in denial that things are over. This isn’t my first time. I have other options if this doesn’t work. 
I guess I’m just not strong enough to fight these battles anymore

Edit: I’m okay. God saved me and I’m okay. I’m mentally still struggling, but I’m alive.
