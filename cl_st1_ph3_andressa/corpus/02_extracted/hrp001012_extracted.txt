I am just alone all the time, though I live in a large city.  Everything socially in this country seems to revolve around drinking and I don't drink.  I feel so inadequate and have no idea how to make friends.  I used to self medicate with drugs and just kind of be in my own world and cope I guess.   But I quit all this.  Almost 3 years since I had a drink, and now several weeks without cannabis.  Now all these feelings I pushed away for decades come up all day and I spontaneously cry a lot.  Haven't been able to sleep much in weeks and I just feel like I've wasted so much time coping in life and avoided taking the steps I needed to actually build a life and be happy.  I guess I just want to know others are out there and maybe have experienced something similar.  Peace and love to all.
