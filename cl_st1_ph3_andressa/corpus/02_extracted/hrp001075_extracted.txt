It really does.

I feel like a car that got stuck in mud. Shifting gears, trying to go forwards, then backwards, then forwards again and without noticing it, I dug myself deeper and deeper in. Now I'm in so deep that occasionally muddy water reaches my engine and I have to stop moving in order for my engine to not suck water in and killing it. I am unable to get out by myself. Yet there's no tow truck in sight. And even if, by a miracle, I get out of the mud, am I able to drive again. Do I still manage to navigate the streets, ease in to the flow of traffic?

I often think that the junkyard is the best place for me. Sitting amongst other rusty cars that no longer have a purpose, but I was built to last and I think it's still too much spark left in me to just give up. Or maybe it's only fear that keeps me going, that keeps me moving back and forth as soon as the muddy water once again has subsided.

A vicious cycle for now.
