20F. I was the quiet, weird, borderline mute kid throughout basically my entire life. Now in college I’m actually trying my best to engage myself in conversations with everyone. And yet people still don’t really like me. 

I can’t force anyone to be my friend/like me. I get that. But I didn’t think it’d be this painful to be on talking terms but not on texting/talking after class terms. I thought I could be friends with this one girl but she only ever texts me asking about homework :/. 

I wish I hadn’t tried to be out going. Rejection hurts more than choosing to be alone haha. 

I even tried my best to talk to this one guy who seemed shy like I was so I sat next to him in class. He’s so damn quiet and seems irritated every time I try to be friendly with him so I’m starting to give up on him. Although he hasn’t changed where he sits, so maybe there’s still a chance of us being friends. Idk. 

Maybe I should stop pestering people like him. Maybe other quiet people aren’t desperate for friends like I am and just wanna be left alone hah. Maybe I’m just that fucking annoying.
