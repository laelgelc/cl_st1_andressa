Hi. First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!

My name's Hugo, I'm from Spain, and almost 23 years old.

I don't want to sound thirsty or desperated. I know that's such a turn-off. I just want to get this out my chest.

I lost my job due to depression almost a month ago and started taking meds for it after 15 years of just bearing with everything on my own. Not very wise of me not asking for help earlier, but who can trust public healthcare nowadays?

Anyways... I don't feel comfortable giving many details about my life publicly because I hate feeling myself exposed. I just wanna say I feel completely drained off.

I've been locked up home for the last three weeks just playing videogames and sleeping. Not even eating nor crying because I have no energy for it.

I've never felt myself so alone in my entire life. I tried everything you can imagine (and I mean it) to get to know new people, even if it's online, but meeting new people is almost impossible nowadays, even more if you're introverted like me.

It's not my first period of solitude, but it's being the worst. I've always been such an expressive guy with friends, but things always happen in all groups and they always end up tearing apart. I had traumatic experiences with old "friends" of mine that led me to adopt a more solitary and sedentary lifestyle five years ago. I have good friends nowadays, yeah, but we're all adults and they all have their own relationships and works to take care of. I'm just that one friend whose life's not going as well as theirs.

So... That's it. I don't mean to make anyone feel bad about me or talk to me out of pityness at all. I just wanted to open up, since I feel myself drowned in my own constant rumination and loneliness.

If anybody feels like talking, I'd be happy and grateful for having someone to speak with. <3

Thank you for reading this.

Best regards,

- Hugo 💜
