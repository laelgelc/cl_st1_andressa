Why can’t I just give up. Why.

I should just tell everyone in my life to piss off. At least that way I won’t have any future instances of being shown that someone else will always be chosen over me. I am nothing to anyone. I am filth.

I wasn’t built to connect with people. I wasn’t built to be a person. I wasn’t built to be cared about. I’ll never be anything. Ever. And no one will ever care about me. Why do I have such a constant inability to accept that fact and keep letting myself talk to people, and know them? Care about them? They’re not even assholes for feeing that way. It’s not even their fault that they don’t care about me. Why would they? How could they? They should all just keep laughing at me and tell me all the reasons why they’ll never choose me.

I am empty. I am hollow. I am worthless.
