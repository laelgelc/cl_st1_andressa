I’m 19M, and I’ve dealt with loneliness my whole life. But I’m not giving up yet, and really, you probably shouldn’t either. 

The method I use: genuine curiosity of others around me. 

I learn languages and love to learn about cultures. This makes me very curious to know more about people around me. Last semester, I really enjoyed talking to this worker at my college from Rwanda. She loved that I was learning her language and it was the best part of leaving the gym for me. 

Today, I was learning the language of a worker from Kenya. She introduced me to a girl my age who also spoke Swahili. She happened to be with two other girls and I was able to chat with them about languages. 

You don’t even need to have a specific topic like languages. The other day at the gym, I saw a girl with tattoos that looked self-colored. I asked her about them briefly and wished her a nice workout. It’s not creepy, and having those interactions is important. 

My point is: yes, this doesn’t guarantee you deep connections. But it increases your chances of making friends by a lot. You can choose to say “I have anxiety, so I won’t even try”. Or you can say “I have anxiety, but I’m going to overcome my fears”. That’s what you would want for the main character in a movie, why not want you to make that good decision?
