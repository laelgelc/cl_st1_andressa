For context I am 22 i was enrolled in community college, had prior history of depression which caused me to fail my classes and have to retake them again. I live in a very controlling, abusive, and mentally taxing household and work as much as I can. I mostly am supporting myself financially school wise at the moment. I recently transferred to a highly rated competitive university but am struggling significantly. I decided to commute in the spring in order to work and save up a little more. I don’t get any aid due to my gpa from cc being low due to me failing as well as living with my parents. Right now I feel myself slipping back into depressed and have been struggling greatly I also recently found out my university considers transfers and commuters as least priority for housing and my chances are practically zero unless I live off campus where housing tends to be very expensive. On top of this, I don’t have a car and am currently in the process of saving for one so I rely on commuting by shuttle (30-45 mins). I feel extremely alone and cannot even join clubs due to meetings being after class hours and shuttle timings. I don’t really know what to do and would appreciate any advice for my situation.
