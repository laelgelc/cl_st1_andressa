I have a very good and flexible job, no financial issues, a beautiful wife, multiple young kids, some friends I can message, a men's group at church, a dog, am fit/athletic and healthy... have many hobbies that I enjoy doing...

Yet I still feel so alone most of the time? I love being around people more than anything and my wife used to fill that cup to the brim every day but she has since really grown into her own hobbies/interests and is pretty addicted to social media/validation so it's hard to just spend quality time with her these days as she feels very emotionally unavailable no matter how hard I try. I just feel like I YEARN to be desired/wanted as a person, just miss having that feeling of SOMEONE looking forward to seeing me and thinking about me and just focusing 1 on 1 time together?

It's tough because I have young kids and can't just "build friendships" because I never want to miss time with my littles either. Just sort of feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Has anyone else felt this way? How did you overcome this immense sense of just feeling alone even if you TECHNICALLY have people around you?
