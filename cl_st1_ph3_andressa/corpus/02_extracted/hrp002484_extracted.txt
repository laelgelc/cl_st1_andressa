Every time I try to connect with someone they tell me to look for someone else. I guess I m just not interesting, I was homeschooled for period of time and now when I search feels impossible to become friends with anyone. I became desperate to find just one, but every conversation I had was the last with the respective person. I m tired of looking, people started to call me corny or they tell me to "get a life".
