Haven’t had an IRL friend in over 10 years. Even the “friends” I had before weren’t really. Never had a girlfriend either really of course. The loneliness is a type of pain I can’t even describe. It just hurts so much. I don’t have much family left either. When they’re gone, then I’m truly alone for good. I don’t want to die alone. I’m like paralyzed by anxiety and fear. The future looks so bleak.
