Yesterday I go out with some ex high school class mates that I wouldn't even consider them friends at all, so the bar was playing music that I didn't like and idk just the vibe abt everything wasn't my thing.

I wished I could find my people, I try to do something but I never even kissed someone, no one texts me unless is something related to my job and that's it, I'm just always bored and I can't enjoy things. I feel like a passanger in my own life, I've been so passive that I swear I'll never have a partner and ppl kinda gets away with me, and no, therapy is not the answer for everything.
