I've just started college. I have a lot of friends; I can party almost everyday. I meet with people all the time.

Yet I feel lonely as hell.

Everyone has a "best friend". Person that they can talk to about anything and anytime. I have plenty of friends but every conversation is shallow and not lengthy. Sometimes I have to wait for hours to get an answer and I can see that they were online the whole time. At this point of life everyone already has a best friend and it is impossible to find someone now. 

I wonder if its something with how I present myself. Maybe people see me as someone with a lot of friends, so they don't want to engage with me. 

I am handsome, have a lot of hobbies (like really, I can talk about everything), I am certainly not boring because at parties I am usually the main attraction (or so was I told). All that and I still can't find a "best friend", yet alone a girlfriend. 

I can't vent to anyone. That's why I am now doing it here on reddit. It's been like that for over two years when I broke up with my ex that was my only best friend. Since then, I am craving for another type of relationship where I could talk about anything and not get ghosted for hours.
