I just got back from class on the new semester after a brea. Everything went wrong, had to introduce myself in front of everyone, fucked it up and started sweating, didn't bring lunch and didn't eat all day and now I'm anxious and have a headache. I didn't expect to be so cold and wore something light, but it was extremely cold, I'll most likely get sick tomorrow. I couldn't keep up with the class, and my headache is killing me. Also I keep having a huge amount of intrusive thoughts about how stupid I was when I introduced myself, i wanna sleep but can't and I wish I had someone to vent to. My head is killing me.
