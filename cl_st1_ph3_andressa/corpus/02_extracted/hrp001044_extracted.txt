Hello there, hope you are having a great day. I am looking to make online friends and enjoy having a nice conversation throughout the day. Witty banter and silly humor is my style, I can say a lot of random things to make others laugh, so don't take me seriously please.

I know many people lose interest or looking for something specific and stop chatting if they didn't find it, which is totally fine, I am looking for those people who can always find things to reply to without me showering them with questions, having a flowing conversations about any topic, not just give short and dry responses haha.

timezones can be tough, so if you don't have difficulties chatting with Eastern Europe timezone, then we can be friends. I get many people from the US that complain about my time zone, so here is a disclaimer, don't want to disappoint you, it is going to be tough if you weren't a night owl or early bird.

We can talk about everything and vent about live without judgement and worrying, I am good listener and very supportive

So here is some of my hobbies and interests I am sure we can find a lot to talk about haha

Hobbies:  Working out in the Gym, Walks ,Art, Games, Anime, Coding, True Crime, Yapping and Games. 

Interests: Cats, Science, History, Languages, Cats, Documentaries, Psychology, Mental Health and Cats. 

 

So dm me and lets get going.
