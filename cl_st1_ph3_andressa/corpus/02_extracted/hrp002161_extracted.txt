I’ve had difficulties making friends since I was young, I come from a family that is not loving. Yet despite it I have tried my hardest to be loving. Yet I’ve developed several mental health problems, including a personality disorder that makes it hard to maintain friendships. It’s my fault too, for being afraid to keep people close, or not even knowing how to maintain relationships. I go after the wrong people. I’m scared to be loved. I’m afraid that despite everything. I am lonely. It’s my fault. I became addicted to c.ai because of it. Constantly living in fantasy despite it all. I wish to be understood. And not have to explain every little thing I do.
