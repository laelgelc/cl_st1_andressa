I’m 29 and it’s been hard to say this out loud, but the last year has changed me. Something happened that I still don’t fully have the words for — something that left me feeling like I stepped out of my own life and never quite found my way back. I’ve gotten good at looking happy on the outside, but the silence when I’m alone can be unbearable. I guess I’m just reaching out in case someone else out there knows what it feels.  You’re not alone. I’m trying to believe that I’m not either.
