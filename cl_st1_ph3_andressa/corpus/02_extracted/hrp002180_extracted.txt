 Today the loneliness feels really heavy. I have people around me. Conversations happen. Days move forward. But inside, I feel deeply unseen — like I exist in everyone else’s life without truly being felt in it.
It’s not one big moment . It’s the steady drip of small things — not being listened to, being forgotten, feeling like my needs are inconvenient, like my feelings take up too much space. I find myself wondering what it must feel like to be truly considered. To feel chosen, not just present.
  What hurts the most is how quiet this kind of loneliness is. You can go through an entire day smiling, functioning, responding… while inside you feel like a ghost.I'm so tired of being strong. I think what scares me is how easy it has become to carry this alone. I don’t want to disappear into a life where I am tolerated but not deeply known.  Has anyone else felt this way? Not just lonely, but fundamentally unseen? And if you have… how did you find your way back to feeling real again?
