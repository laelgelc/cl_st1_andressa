I’ve seen similar posts so I figured I’d give it a try. 
I’m 21, non-binary, androgynous and queer. I’m socially awkward and have mega autism so I don’t really interact much with anyone. I live in Ohio and I’m moving in a few years to upstate NY. 

I love all things animal related. Exotic pets, reptiles, birds, fish, insects, wildlife rehab, random animal facts ^_^ I’m also outdoorsy. I forage for plants and mushrooms, go fishing, collect bones and skulls :3 so basically a goth nature spirit. XD
I love music, especially metal and rock. I listen to a lot of “old” music, from the 30s to the 80s.
Sometimes I do art. I do random crafts, vulture culture related stuff, I make jewelry and fursuit stuff and I do clothing alterations :3

I have bad anxiety so I don’t go out much… No concerts, conventions, bars or clubs. I’m also not really much of a gamer. ;w; I have really bad depression but I’m managing it well.
