I think I gotta accept the harsh fact that I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my damn life, I feel like nobody wants to date a loser like me who struggles to be an extrovert or I'm just damn undesirable. I just want to be loved (romantically) from someone, feel like I matter too. So I just gotta accept the fact that I'm just gonna alone for the rest of my damn life.
