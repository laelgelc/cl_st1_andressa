It's a saturday night and I had no plans. I had no plans last saturday night, or the one before that.  
My best friend stopped talking to me around halloween. I asked her what was wrong and she said she felt like a bad friend and didn't nkow how to talk to me. When I asked her why she thought she was a bad friend she said it was because she hadn't been talking to me. 

Since then I haven't really had anyone to share my updates with. No one to tell the things I experience or new accomplishments I've made.   
I don't really know how much longer I feel I can handle this type of loneliness.
