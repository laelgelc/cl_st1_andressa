I constantly feel so cursed and absolutely fucked by my trauma and the people and things that caused it. I feel like I can never be too honest. I can give people general run downs and they apologize, sympathize, be kind, and thats fantastic! But I can't to into detail, I can't talk about how I really truly feel about it, it makes people too uncomfortable. They are a supportive network in a regular way and I appreciate it, but sometimes it makes me feel really alone that they cant be there for me in the way I need, and it sucks because I also know it isn't their fault, but it doesnt make it feel any less bad. I feel like im never going to be able to achieve a 'real' connection with anybody. I have close friends but it feels like theres cling film between us. I think its my own fault though, I have a hard time with the idea that someone could like me as much as I like them, so I think I dont really let people in. I want to be better so bad. Ive been trying really hard and I know progress takes a while but sometimes I am just so fucking angry, or alone, miserable, bitter, empty.
