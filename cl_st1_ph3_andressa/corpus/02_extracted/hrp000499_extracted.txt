I could never find anyone who genuinely likes me. 

I’m sick of feeling like a beggar/bother each time I reach out to someone. I’m sick of feeling their disappointment from miles upon seeing my notification.. 

I could never experience having talk to someone who actually wants to talk to me. Not because they feel sorry for me or they just wanna kill time..  I suppose when you’re ugly like me, it’s nearly impossible to find any mutual connection 😔
