This time of year always makes me feel the smallest. I have no one to have a conversation with or even share a laugh. Everyone around me seems to be enjoying life with things to do and places to go and here I sit with emptiness. My ex wife cheated on me and left 5 years ago and most of our friends stayed with her. I tried to date but I’m now 50 and it’s fucking exhausting trying to get thru to find a nice woman who doesn’t have red flags everywhere. I know I’m not perfect, far from it but I’m a loving, half decent looking man with a good income and home. I just can’t seem to connect with a good woman or if I do I have been let down and lied to on way too many occasions. I’ve gotten to the point of not even bothering with trying anymore and just get used to the emptiness of my life.  Sorry for the downer post just need to vent and have no one to do it too.
