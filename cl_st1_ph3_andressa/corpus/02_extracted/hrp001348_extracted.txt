I know this is not the appropriate sub but I don't know where to post

I am 19 years old from Egypt

I am 5'4, ugly, weak young man with a small thin penis, a skinny fat physique and poor sight.

I know I am cooked because of things that I didn't choose and will never change

When I see couples and guys who have sex, I feel like heartbroken, I used to be a good person but recently I become a guy who love to watch people suffer or die

I can't suicide because I am a Muslim and I believe that who committs suicide goes to Hell

I want just to cope but I am traumatized, I really wanna help, I cry every day and I feel so freaking heartbroken
