Im a drinker never been loved by anyone, no friends really or family no partner. Just nothing and I just cry all the time and drink there's nothing about me putting myself out there cause im just not interesting. People use me as the butt of every joke or just to pedestal themselves cause im not the best looking. Im tired of being alone and unloved I dont have a purpose in this world ive done nothing but struggle all my days ive lived , im tired of going out alone and doing everything by myself. People only hangout with me for the sake of religious reasons and to make themselves look better, im tired of everything im not sure how I feel anymore just hollow. I hate myself enough already happy new years
