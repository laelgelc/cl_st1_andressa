it's actually scary how lonely I am. I don't have anyone whatsoever. Didn't received a message from anyone in 3 weeks and don't have anyone to call to or send a message to go out or something. It's tough.... But the good part is that I'm moving to other country so hopefully things will get better. Why am I lonely like this atm? a combination of things. But when ur down in a hole like that the best way is to turn ur life upside-down. Go live in a different country or whatever. I know the older u get the lonely u are (at least is more common) but I am 21 and I didn't get used to be completely alone. It's not healthy... it sucks. I'm in this situation for about 3 years but not so extremely. It got worse about 2-3 months ago but it's maddening. What should I do? How can I meet some ppl? life doesn't have a tutorial it's hard to think HOW. I might just move to another country I really think it'll work or help at the very least
