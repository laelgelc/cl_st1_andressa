I want to stop myself for feeling this way. So basically, I got attached to a person I matched on a dating app. Tho we both were looking for friends. And we wwre chatting for a month and all. Actually it's all good. And I sometimes think about him. We're friends and I never had a guy friend that makes me feel safe and he's like me. We both are into fitness. But the thing is I'm scared of getting attached because it hurts. It's starting to get hurt now. I want to stop this cycle of me getting attached and then imagining moments with them and then I get hurt because of my thoughts. I  have hobbies, I workout , and most of my time in a day is  spent on workout, school task, cooking and YouTube. I don't want to think of him anymore. I wanna be happy alone. But i just can't. I am overthinking if he'll leave me and lose interest to me. That's what I'm really scared about.
