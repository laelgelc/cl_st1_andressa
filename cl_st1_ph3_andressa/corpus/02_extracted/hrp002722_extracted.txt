There's this group of friends that is mad at me because I never go out  with them while their main activity is to drink and being silly in the evening. At first I really appreciated the fact that they wanted me to go out so bad, so I went, but it happened really few days. Then, after I realized that this activity didn't amused me, I started  going out with them more sporadically and then I stopped and proposed several times to go out in the afternoon to have a coffee or to do some shopping, just to be polite and be with them even if not in the evening, if the matter was that they wanted me so bad with them (obv this has been ignored by them).
I'm really sad because nowadays they still don't understand my individuality and my need to be alone, even if I sorta like them (but not while they're drunk or just silly tbh). I don't want to change my personality due to a group of friends that's excluding me because of this part of my being, so I'm starting to find new friends or to stay in touch with the friends that understand this need. 
What would you do?
