I had a online friend I known for years but she has a habit of going dark for some months before getting back to me. I initally dismissed it as just part of her personality but she told me she found a boyfriend and they got closer by talking everyday for MONTHS. Of course I tell myself it makes sense, she met him at her school and everyone naturally places romance over friendship, so why am I surprised? But God, hearing that pissed me off. Am I doing something wrong where she feels like she can't respond to me for fucking months, but some guy she does in minutes? I certainly must be.

I try to be reasonable, I always have but I'm fucking tired of making excuses for people. They just don't like me, how else can I reframe it? Anyone else?
