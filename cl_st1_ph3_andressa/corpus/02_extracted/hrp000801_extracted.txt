im a 24 year old male and ive never felt more lonely than these past couple years to the point where i don't know what todo with myself and im at my breaking point i stay up till dumb hours trying to keep my mind focusing on other things so i don't think negatively but by each day it gets harder and harder, i usually end getting emotional when my mother is not around as i don't want her to see me like this.

I'm not gonna talk about relationships as I've tried and nothing has ever worked out 

im lost and i feel numb and life doesn't seem to mean much to me anymore and i don't know what todo
