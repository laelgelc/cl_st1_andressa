Hey all, I have moved to a new city for work and living alone in a flat currently. I like having my own space and not sharing with flatmates. But recently feeling lonely. I don't know anyone else apart from work and they all have their own families to hangout with. Tried matching with a few on Bumble, but didn't vibe with them. Any other way I can make friends or meet new people?
