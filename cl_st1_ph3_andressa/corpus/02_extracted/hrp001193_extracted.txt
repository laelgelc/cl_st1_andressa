I was supposed to graduate in January 2025 but a ton of unfortunate events happened and I ended up graduating in December instead. At first I was super excited and couldn't wait to finish my last class and busted my butt as hard as I could to get it done with three kids, a house, pets, and a boyfriend to take care of. I did it I graduated.. but the hype only lasted about 30 minutes. Because that's when I realized I have nobody. I have my kids and that's about it. My parents don't care and called me selfish for going back to school because my focus should have been 100% on the kids 100% of the time. My boyfriend gave me a lousy "I'm proud of you" than went back to playing on his phone.. than I realized I have no friends. I am a 31 year old woman with three kids and nobody by my side. I don't even know how to make friends anymore because I am a stay at home mom and everything is online. Call me old school but I miss and need that face to face interaction. Maybe I am selfish because part of me was hoping for a graduation party of some sort even if it was just my boyfriend and the kids and we went out to dinner. But nothing, zero, nada. I feel so lonely it isn't even funny anymore.
