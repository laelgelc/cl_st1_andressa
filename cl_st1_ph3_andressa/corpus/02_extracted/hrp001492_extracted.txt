Does anyone have ASD and experience being ghosted a lot? I’m becoming really depressed because I’ve been trying to build a social life for almost a year and many people i meet on bff/dating apps end up ghosting me, even After They start making or make plans to meet up with me and things are going very well. I’m Just so confused. I’m kind and Very loving but apparently there’s something deeply wrong With me That makes people leave. My therapist says she believes nothing is wrong with me and it’s just the people’s fault but most people have irl friends and i don’t. I try Pretty hard to make them but all attempts fail. I made 2 great autistic friends in the past month and they’re both ghosting me now despite us having made plans together. I feel like i don’t deserve to be alive.
