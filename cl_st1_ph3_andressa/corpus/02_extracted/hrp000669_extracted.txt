hi. Unfortunately, I have no one to talk to. I'm stuck with my frustrations and pointless life.

I'm 30 and I have nothing to show for it. I'm stuck in a house that's falling apart. trying to find someone who will swap with me, but no one is interested.  I've even tried applying to buy my own 2-bed house, and even a flat. something to say, " look at this. I did this, " but to no avail. 

I am in a dead-end job with no opportunities to work my way up. I've applied for countless jobs, but no one wants to know. Around here, no one wants to know someone who's only ever been a cleaner. I don't have decent grades because, unfortunately, I am dumb as fuck xD I even try to do free online courses, but I am hopeless at them.

I've tried to sell and/or do videos in my spare time, but, as per usual, not one person is or was interested.

A long time ago, I watched a video on how there are different types of people in this world. Those who are big people. Main characters. Those meant for something in this world. They are the top. Then there are those in the middle who still have a purpose, who still help make the world go round and do good with their lives. Then there are the bottom feeders. Those born to struggle don't actually have a real purpose for the planet. They are just less than background characters. They are pointless specks. Just fillers of this world, and unfortunately, I am a part of the bottom feeders. I know you can't win them all, but just to have a win would be amazing. 

I know we all struggle with one thing or another but just to be a part of something would make me so happy.

Just to even have someone be in love with me would be a fucking miracle.

I mask every day and pretend everything is fine. That I don't care.

But the truth is, I do care. I care so fucking much, but it gets me nowhere. Unless you count being hurt somewhere.

I'm stuck and I just want to get out.
