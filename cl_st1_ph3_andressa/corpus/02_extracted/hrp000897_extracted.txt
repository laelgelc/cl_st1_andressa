Hello, I've been depressed for many years. I've been in therapy intermittently, with a psychiatrist and on medication as well, although I stopped using them years ago due to financial and time issues. Today, I have a deep feeling of boredom, resentment, and discomfort with how my life has turned out these days. Sometimes it seems like I live it more out of obligation, unable to feel happy, excited, or fulfilled. My life up until my young adulthood has become increasingly lonely, with very few friendly or loving relationships, and with many worries. I have a hard time sleeping, and I have nightmares daily. Sometimes I just wish I could receive a sincere hug, something that calms my panic/anxiety attacks. Lately, the days seem way too long and painful, however, I find it difficult to even cry. Any advice?
