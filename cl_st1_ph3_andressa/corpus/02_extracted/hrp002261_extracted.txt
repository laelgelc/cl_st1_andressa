I have an overbite.  A very noticeable one, to the point i really can't close my lips unless i push my jaw forward which is very uncomfortable. Also, my facial bones are recessed and not as strong as my parents. My dad is around 5'10, my mom is 5'6 and I'm 5'7. I don't know how all this happened but that's how it is. I always been the small kid in school. Also I'm neurodivergent in top of all this. I'm low iq and i just have very bad social skills. 

I never really had friends. Sometimes people felt bad about me and talk with me, but not real friendship, never hang out with anybody and most of the time I was alone. I dropped out of highschool when i was 13-14 because of how painful it was to go school. Now I'm 19. I only made online "friends" who at the end betrayed me or started ignoring me. I'm always weird around people, make them feel awkward or disgusted. I can't do anything about it. And I don't want to change my way of being because people don't like me. I don't think it is long term sustainable, I already tried and is not possible, eventually i slip, i get tired of masking who I am and people start disliking me and ignoring me.

I guess I will live my life as a homeless lonely mentally ill dude.
