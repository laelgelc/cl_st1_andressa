I have many friends, many good ones that care about me but I can’t shake this lonely feeling the second they all go to bed, i know it’s cause I’m craving to finally to be in a proper relationship. I wish to find my other half, I’m tired of thinking of what’s happening to her or if she even exist. I want to be in a relationship for once were we both love each other but it’s always one sided most of the time it’s me loving them and them not caring.
