The title says it all, really. I’m 29 right now and haven’t had a close friend in so long. 
I have no one to talk to but my husband, and I love him to death but it’s not the same as having my own friends. 
It’s so freaking depressing. 
How do people make friends? I swear there is something wrong with me
