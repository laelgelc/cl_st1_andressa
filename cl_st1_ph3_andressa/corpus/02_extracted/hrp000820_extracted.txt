f18, a self-supporting student for years now. its so hard. i am so miserable. no one knows what its like to carry all the pressure and all the pain bc u have no one.. i have no friends and on top of that i have fucked up dead beat parents.. its so hard.. no one will ever truly know my pain. ive been thinking for days now that i just wanna kms to end the suffering.. i have never spent a bday happy, all i get are some beating from parents or nothing at all—not even a simple hbd. i am so miserable… goodbye everyone..
