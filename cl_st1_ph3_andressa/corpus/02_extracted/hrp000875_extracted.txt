Bruh idk why this got me but I’m off on a Saturday and I have nothing to do I know it might seem like whatever but like even if I wanted to do something I couldn’t it’s just me I’m serious alone I think if I disappear nothing would change no one’s life would be affected it’ll be like I never existed and that’s kinda what I want to not exist I just wanna go away forever I don’t think I can take much more of this I’m losing my mind I have no one no one at all I don’t remember the last time I was told I was loved and it’s getting to me I just want to be something for someone somebody’s reason to smile I’m just a waste waste of space I’m just taking up room someone else’s space I think I just wanna disappear for a while just leave for a while idk I kinda regret typing this now sorry if I wasted ur time I kinda just need to get stuff off of my mind 



Edit: tbh I kinda care about punctuation so sorry if ur head hurts from this
