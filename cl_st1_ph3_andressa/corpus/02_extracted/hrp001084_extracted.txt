I'm a very selective person, and I've distanced myself so much from the society I'm in. For years, I convinced myself that people weren't right for me, that it wasn't working, that we weren't the same kind of whole. At this point, I wonder if I should let new people into my life or continue as I am. Sometimes I question myself: what if they abandon me halfway? What if they do something to break my heart again, like they did last time? I'm not being hopeless; it's just that almost everyone I know is similar to each other, that's all.
