Lately, I’ve been asking myself—why does it feel like nobody wants anything to do with me? I know I have my quirks, but I’m not awkward or weird. I’m confident in who I am, and I know I’ve got good qualities.

Since my wife left, everything’s felt different. It’s like the world just kind of… pulled back. I try to stay strong and keep my head up, but honestly, I’m struggling. I want to connect with people—to have real friends again, someone to talk to, maybe even build something romantic again.

I don’t want this loneliness to define me or break me. I’m doing the best I can, but sometimes it’s just hard to understand why it feels like I’m invisible. If you’ve ever felt like this, or if you’re open to connecting, just know—I’m here, and I’d really appreciate a conversation. 32/ M4F Louisville, ky
