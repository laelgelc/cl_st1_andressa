Was in the room I use for storage today, and found this.  I was going to give it to my niece, but forgot, then I decided I would give to the girl across the road for her birthday.  During the blizzard in March, the family was scared, no power for days.  Gabby and her brother Mario were so scared, I bought spare blankets over and read books.  About a month later, I went to town and when I came back that evening, my neighbor walked over to tell me they moved out.  Gabby was screaming for her Marky, she knew that's what my niece calls me.  I was so upset.  Tomorrow is her birthday.  Don't know where they went.  I'm so alone without them, and without my family.  It is taking such a toll.
