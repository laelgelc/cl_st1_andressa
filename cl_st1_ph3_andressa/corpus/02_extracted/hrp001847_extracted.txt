I get so fixated to the point where I get actually angry for the characters. I mean I know that’s the typical tv watching experience but no I mean like it infuriates me or I can’t stop thinking about it. And I get sad knowing that this isn’t real or that this isn’t my life lol. I think that’s peak loneliest right there.
