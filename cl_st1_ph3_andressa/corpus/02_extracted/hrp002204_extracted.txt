As the title says, Ive been questioning the point of it all. I sit around every day doing nothing at all, I play bass and guitar and that's it. I learn new things on those two instruments every day. I wake up at 11 and go to bed at 3am. Its the same every day. I should be working and I know I should be working but I just don't see the point, I know I'm not really supposed to and I'm just supposed to do it. But I can't bring myself to. I feel like it's giving away some kind of dignity I'm withholding. But I also feel destined to give into working some dead end job. I question whether or not it'll even have an effect on me because if I'm doing nothing everyday then what's the difference if I do nothing at some subway. I really truly just want to be someones someone, and I know that's not much of an ask because a lot of people want that too and I'm capable of being their person too. It just seems so bleak though
