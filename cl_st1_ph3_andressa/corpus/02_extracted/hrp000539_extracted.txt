It feels like nothing matters anymore, the one thing i like to do is play soccer and thats it. Lately i have been feeling that i am not enough for anybody, especially my closest friends. I just feel alone whenever im with them and left out of the conversations. They have secrets they are not telling me. My friends and i are in the same class, we have a friend group where me and one other guy is left out we have been starting to play videogames together but everytime I am with the other friends they just comment and saying I am a betrayer. I dont know what to do i feel so alone.
