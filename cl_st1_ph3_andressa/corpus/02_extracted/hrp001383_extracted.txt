Over the last six months, I’ve realized that the people in my life don’t really show up for me the way I show up for them. I’ve spent years giving, checking in, being there for others, not because I expected anything back right away, but because I thought that’s how relationships work.

When I do try to open up, I usually get advice or analysis instead of actual empathy, so I end up keeping most of it to myself so I don’t feel like a burden. But it’s getting really heavy to carry alone. Especially with the holidays coming up, they amplify what you have in your life, for many that is love and joy. Unfortunately I have increased grief and sadness for the life I thought I would have, as well as alienation from those who say they care about me. 

Here hoping to connect with people who get what it’s like to feel unseen.
