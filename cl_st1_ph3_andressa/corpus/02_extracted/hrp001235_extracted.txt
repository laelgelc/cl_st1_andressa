Iv never made a post here before but I really need to find people who understand me before I lose my marbles. I’m 29, single, I suffer my anxiety and depression and I live alone with my dog and cat. Iv had a roommate for a short period of time, and a partner for another short period of time. I struggle so much with living alone. My family lives alittle far, and they rarely visit 😕 
It’s weird because I have somewhat of a good social life, I have friends, i have a therapist, I have hobbies that I don’t put 100 percent of my time into but I still have some, and u had a job I enjoy. But I still dread the night time. I dread coming home after work to the silence of my house. I dread laying down with my thoughts running around and the immense amount of loneliness I feel. Sometimes it’s so bad I cry, and I literally feel like I need to get up and go for a drive or something. I’ll scroll for hours until 2 or 3 am, because I can’t get myself to relax or be comfortable. I feel so happy when someone visits me, or spends the night but when they leave the silence feel so much louder. Teas. sleeping pills, working out, full 8 hours shift, none of it helps or distracts me enough. Is anyone else dealing with this, can you please give me some tips. I feel like I’m the loneliest person I know.
