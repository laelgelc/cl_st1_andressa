ok so I have insomnia so what better way to spend time where i could be sleeping than to rant about teachers? Whoopdie doo lets get to it (Im sorry im sleep deprived) ok so why do teachers call our parents whenever we get in trouble? Like what good is that gonna do? Its just gonna make us more scared of our parents and terrified to tell them anything with the fear of them yelling at you. From the way i see it it just ruins my relationship with my parents and teachers. Or is this just me? Just me? ok ill shut up now thank you for coming to my ted talk.
