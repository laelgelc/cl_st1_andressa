Have the holidays been feeling heavier than usual? You’re not broken. You’re not failing. You’re just human.

This season triggers loneliness for more people than you think… and I’ve been there too.

Today’s message is a reminder that you’re not stuck with the holidays you had —you can build new ones starting today. Reach out. Reconnect. Honor who you lost. Or open the door to new people and new beginnings.

You matter more than you think.
