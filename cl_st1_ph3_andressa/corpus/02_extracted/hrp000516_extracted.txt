This is just a rant. I feel really ugly, and no matter what I do, it feels like I’ll never escape that feeling. I know I’m supposed to accept it, but I still wish I could feel beautiful for just one day even if I know I’m not.

A big part of this comes from how people treated me in the past because of my looks. I don’t understand why the way I looked was reason enough to be put down. Even though the bullying has stopped, it still feels like an open wound that never fully healed.

And sometimes people on here can be cruel too. It feels like they know some people are vulnerable, and they take advantage of that instead of showing kindness.
