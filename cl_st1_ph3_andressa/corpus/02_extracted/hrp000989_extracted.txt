Hey, I've never posted on something like this before. Sorry if something is wrong, please direct me in the right direction. 

That's all I'm really asking for I guess. Direction. I don't have many friends anymore, and I recognize my role in that. There just isn't much I know of to do about it, nor do I seemingly have the initiative to pull it off, which again I recognize my part in. Now I sound like someone complaining for the sake of it without wanting to anything about it. Maybe I am.

To be honest though, I feel like I deserve a good complaint though. I've been bottling everything up while trying to stay positive, and the ones I have tried talking to seemingly don't understand it the way I do, which I can't blame them for, everyone has their own experience.

I have a lot of words to say. A lot of thoughts in my head. A lot. Good and bad. I've just not been of value to anyone lately. And I know I can't expect that from anyone necessarily, everyone has their own life going on. But that doesn't mean it isn't lonely sometimes. Honestly, I'm fine most of the time. I just have moments like this where I just wish to be heard. Or held. I don't remember the last time I was. 

I'm on the road to recovery. I know I am. That's what makes it so hard. Knowing I'm going to recover without my old friends. Knowing they won't get to see me happy. Knowing that when I do have an off day like today, they aren't there to support me anymore. Again, I recognize my own role in my situation though. Which is why I'm not asking for sympathy from anyone. Just an ear. Thank you if you read this. I'm not yet sure what I'm doing.
