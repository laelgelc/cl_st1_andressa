I'm 27 F and have earlier been diagnosed with social anxiety and depression. I used to overshare a lot with everyone and lost a lot of people. My parents keep asking at times to get married but I don't have any friends. I feel just jumping into a marriage without establishing my social circle will completely trap me. What if things go wrong and I really don't know how to deal with it. I'm also worried about my safety and security as I'm a woman in India. I'm just clueless as I cannot find an answer
