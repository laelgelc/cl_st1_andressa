31M. I have no one, and I feel lonely. It seems like everyone else has families, partners, friends, plans, while I feel like I’ve somehow fallen out of life and am just watching it from the sidelines. Every holiday reminds me that there’s no one beside me, and that only makes it hurt more. I just hope I’m not the only one who feels this way.
