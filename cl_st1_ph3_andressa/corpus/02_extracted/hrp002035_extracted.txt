I am a 28 year old woman and have absolutely no friends, family, or partner. It sucks coming home from work cause theres no one to text or call. The only notifications I get is from bills and rejection emails from jobs I apply to. I want to go out with people to concerts or trips. I love anime food trivia learning languages. It feels like I’m losing my mind.
