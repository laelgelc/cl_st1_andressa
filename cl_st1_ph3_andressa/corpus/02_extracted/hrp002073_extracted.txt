I don’t even know how to explain this properly, but I feel like I’m constantly failing at things that should be manageable.
I have responsibilities — school, plans, things I know I should be doing — and yet I keep falling behind. Not because I don’t care, but because everything feels heavier than it should. I wake up already tired, already overwhelmed, and the day just… happens to me instead of me living it.
What makes it worse is the loneliness. Even when I’m around people, I feel disconnected and not enough. Everyone else seems to be moving forward, handling things, growing — and I’m stuck feeling behind and ashamed of it.
