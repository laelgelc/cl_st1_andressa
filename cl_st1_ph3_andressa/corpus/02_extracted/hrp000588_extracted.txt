hey guys im a 19M , i guess i’ve always been a loser, facing discrimination from people around me, including family. This has affected my self-worth and made me overthink things a lot. I've tried making friends online through games, but it hasn't worked out. I've been alone most of my life and struggle to communicate with others, which makes it hard to make friends. I just want someone to be there for me and for me to be there for them. I hope to find a real connection with another loser who feels the same way. if its even possible , a girl would be cool
