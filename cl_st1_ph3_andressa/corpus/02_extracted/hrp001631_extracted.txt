Hello ☺️ I am at the beginning stages of starting a project to bring daily connection and light to the people who need it most. 

Loneliness is something so many people suffer with and the thought of people being out there not having someone check on them at least once a week breaks my heart. Connection and community is a basic need for human survival.

I have gone through some pretty low and lonely times myself, not having someone reliable or someone to turn to. I can now say I am truely blessed with some incredible people in my life and honestly every day I count my lucky stars for each and every one of them. 

Everyone deserves connection, everyone deserves to be seen, everyone deserves to feel like someone cares. 

I have a 3 minute survey I’d love if people could fill out, wanting to get as much in for possible do I can give back where it’s truely needed, and if you would like to participate in the a free trial you can leave your details at the end of the survey.

if you’d like to follow along the journey, you can find me on instagram until I get everything else up and running. 

Thanks for your time and please if you can share
