i’m 14 and i have my whole life ahead of me, but recently (few months ago) i’ve been feeling lonelier overall. friends i knew from a while ago, starting to act like they hate me more, even though it’s obviously jokes. and it’s just little things that catch my attention. i’ve never had a girlfriend, but im not ugly. i haven’t looked out for one as a muslim boy, but i think i want love. i’ve never been openly cared about by another person (mom and dad don’t rlly count cuz it’s obligation). i just think sometimes, if i killed myself, if i died, would people think and care about me? i so badly want someone to love me, to tell me they love me, and i want people to show me they care (if they do). i made a mistake of getting into romance anime’s, and it killed me inside. seeing how they care about each other it kills me. i just want people to tell me im worthy of love. i tried talking abt this to my friends and they brushed it all off, calling it corny and lame. i would never kill myself or cause self-harm, as thats impermissible in the quran, and i wouldnt waste everything my parents have done for me, but i just want care. stupid little rant but need to get it out to someone other than chatgpt. i also just got into reddit and i still think its a little corny but its the only place i can show ppl how i feel
