I'm 35(M) and feeling so lonely. Just cannot locate compatible people, cannot unearth a sense of belonging, cannot find lasting connections. If I do find a connection for a while, it's only with people who are far from lonely themselves and can somehow abandon and forget about the bond that we had. It should be encouraging that I only seem to connect with popular people, but it just leaves me wondering what I lack that they possess. I wish I knew if it were bad luck or bad practice.   
  
It's just terrifying to feel that the whole world is a lonely place for me, despite the massive human population. Not that I'd be likely to connect with people from very different cultures to my own, in my experience, but there are enough people within my Anglo-European sphere that I fail to understand why I can't render lasting bonds and end up very single and feeling friendless in any practical sense.
