I wouldn’t say I have no friends, I think I actually have a decent amount. All my classes I have at least a friend or a person I know that I sit with. However, I feel like most of them aren’t super close and they all seem to have their own groups. I usually get lunch with them after class/middle of day, but during dinner time I feel like everyone has their own groups they go with and I just end up eating alone. It’s kind of making me sad because I would rather eat lunch alone than dinner.
