I (18f) think I’ve always been self-conscious about the way that people view me ever since I was a kid. When I was a preteen I thought that embracing geeky interests like anime and expressing myself how I wanted to (cringe egirl fashion) would make me more confident and happy, but it only isolated me more from other people and made them think I was cringe and weird.

When I was 15 I realised how shallow annoying and materialistic I was so I stopped watching anime and listening to the pop music I liked, which killed a piece of my soul at the time. I was dedicated to looking cool, smart and social, even though it hurt to talk to other people. And I didn’t know why, I still don’t.

Now I’ve left highschool and I’m at college. I’ve been trying so hard to talk to people and pretend to be social, relying a bit too much on alcohol probably. And now I’ve just rewatched JJK. And I’m right back where I started, lonely and disgusting gross girl who nobody wants. I’m a loser but I don’t want to be, I want to change, I want to make people like me and chase me but I don’t know how.
