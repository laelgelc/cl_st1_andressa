After almost a year off dating, I decided to try to download tinder again and try to make a connection. I matched with a cute girl and we actually had a decent discussion over text. I received a message from her and when I went to go check it my matches were empty :/ so I guess she unmatched me for whatever reason. I know she doesn’t have any obligation to me, but it still just feels shitty and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this.
