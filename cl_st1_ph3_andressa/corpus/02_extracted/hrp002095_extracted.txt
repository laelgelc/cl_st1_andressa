Have you ever just wished you could disappear? I feel like a total nobody in this world. I don’t have any real friends, and the people I thought were my friends don’t even care about me anyway. I’m terrible at school too. Just feel like I’m totally useless here.

I wonder how many people out there feel the same way—when you finally realize how unremarkable you are, and you’re just here, barely getting by for the sake of surviving.
