Even if they Say it

sometimes there's this feeling that tells you: people dont like you, even if they say it. its like deep inside you think they're against you. They dont want to be part of your life and you feel left out.

i've been there lots of times. And what i learned from it is that nothing is more amazing than loving yourself. there are people out there that they probably dont have your mindset and thats totally fine.

i always felt like the kid, left out alone on a hill. but what you gotta know is that the kid is passed from all of that and he loves himself more everyday for becoming what othera thought he never would.
