I’m feel like a piece of shit everyday I wake up alone everyday not a single text on my phone not a single thing waiting on to happen. I have friends but some of my friends a genuinely don’t like because maybe I don’t like their personality and talking to them feels forced and I don’t want that and I realized I genuinely don’t like them and that makes me feel like a piece of shit because I’m so fucking fake and I do have some good friends but I feel not complete with them bc they have other friends that take a bigger role then I or I don’t feel loved enough in the friendships and we barely hang out or even talk as much and I need consistency .

Sometimes I feel like I don’t even like anyone at all or nobody like me fully as a friend I feel so much hate for people who are my friends for no reason which makes me question if people think the same about me also I know I’m getting off topic so much but this is my first post but every time I get home I don’t have text from no one I have no activities to do and no activity’s I want to do as I tried but every time I go and I don’t have the fun I was expecting in my head it just ruins the whole experience for me but when I’m home I wish I had someone to talk to but I don’t want to text at the same time I also want to call but not be on the phone all day
