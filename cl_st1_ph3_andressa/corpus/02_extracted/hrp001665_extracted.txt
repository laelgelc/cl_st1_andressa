You know,people are always saying "Don't feel sorry for yourself" or else "I don't want your pity".Is

there something wrong with me,because to me it feels like they are saying I shouldn't have compassion for myself or,in the latter case,it's wrong to want compassion for others.Maybe I'm

just pathetic,but I unabashedly feel sorry for myself when the world hurts me and I am flattered

on the very rare occasion when somebody has pity for [me.Am](https://me.Am) I missing something? Am I a jerk for

feeling this way?
