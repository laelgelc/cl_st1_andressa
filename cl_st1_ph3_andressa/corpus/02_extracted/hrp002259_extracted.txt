I don't get it, everybody says "meet new people" Or "try new hobbies" but how is that even supposed to be helpful?! I have hobbies that i truly love. I meet new people and i even have two friends that i truly care about. However that doesn't help, these things are far away from being a solution for loneliness, they are completely different things.

I asked chat gpt before "is there a solution for loneliness" and bro's answer was an immediate no. Thank you chat gpt..—and yes I am guilty of using chat gpt as a therapist in the past. I don't do that anymore.—

Is there an ACTUAL solution that is ACTUALLY helpful and not just something like "love yourself more" Or wtv?
