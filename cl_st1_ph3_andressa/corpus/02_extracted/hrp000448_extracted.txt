I'm prefinal engineering student always engaged in college assignments coding dsa and machine learning but deep inside i feel really lonely I need someone to hear me or can listen your rants and talks for hours just this feeling of loneliness being surrounded by people but deep down I'm alone no one is here to understand and talk to me without any greed.
