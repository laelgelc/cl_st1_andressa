This is my first one of these that l've done. l've been a bastard to all the people l've cared about and burned damn near every bridge. Drinking and being a slob. Damn near what most would consider cheating and

neglecting those who have counted on me the most. I'm trying to get help now but it still doesn't fill the hole l've created in my soul

I’ve been sober for three months now and been receiving the emotions that have been long to catch up to me

I miss my people more than I could’ve ever imagined
