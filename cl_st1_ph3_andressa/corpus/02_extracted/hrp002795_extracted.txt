In high school, I minded my own business and was a loner because I didn’t seek out any friends or anything. That is until an acquaintance I had in middle school switched to my school and she began making friends. I essentially followed her and she lead me to my now group of friends. It’s so weird that if she hadn’t been such an extrovert or if she hadn’t switched schools, I would’ve been that loner. It’s not like I didn’t like being the loner as I was fine being with myself but it really makes me wonder how my high school experience would’ve differed lol
