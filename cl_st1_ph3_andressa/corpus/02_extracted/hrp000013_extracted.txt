I find listening to other people tell stories about thier day, thier life, or literally anything absolutely excruciating. I do not care, not one single bit, about thier life story or have a grain of interest in literally anything thing anyone says. I am physically pained by the droning generic, dull, fake, pathetic shit that comes out of every single person's mouth. I loath them. I want to die during every second of every conversation.
But I am lonely. 
Wtf man.
