It's funny how society preaches about the importance of socializing and pesters loners to socialize with others, yet they're the same ones who will judge and ostracize you for lacking a societal standard or not sharing any of their beliefs and interests. This alone only shows that society is all about conformity. Sure, there are some people that do care about us, but at the end of the day, they also want people who are like-minded in any way.

Here's society in a nutshell:

Society: Hey, you! Why are you all by yourself? Human are social animals. Come on out of your shell and make some friends!

Also Society: You can't hang with us! You don't fit in a certain standard of what is considered the norm, so get lost, loser!
