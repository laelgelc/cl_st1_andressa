Friends are drifting away, and I have been lonely for some time now, I barely get out of the house. I can feel how I lost my spark, I fought so hard to keep it, but I can’t, I don’t have it, it’s been a few years and I just can’t fucking get it back and it makes me so mad. 

Now everyday I’m in a lonely quiet space (even though that silence feels incredibly loud) just feeling miserable and no one to talk to.
