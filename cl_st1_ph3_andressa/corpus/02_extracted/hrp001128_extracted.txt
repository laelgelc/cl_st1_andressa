Lately the quiet feels heavier than ever. No messages popping up, no one asking how I’m doing, no plans to look forward to. It’s just me, stuck in my head replaying every small rejection or awkward moment until it feels like proof that I’m not worth reaching out to. The more days pass without connection, the harder it gets to even try anymore — like the loop is winning and I’m disappearing into it.

I’ve been sitting with that exact weight, feeling like the world moved on without me. Breaking it even a little bit started with admitting how bad it hurt instead of pretending it was fine. Anyone else where the silence is screaming at you rn? What’s one thought that keeps replaying and making it worse?
