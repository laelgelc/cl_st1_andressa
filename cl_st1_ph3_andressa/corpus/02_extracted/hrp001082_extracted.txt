I’m not the same person I used to be back in my teens and early 20s. I struggle with connection due to my anxiety which make people uncomfortable. It’s all my fault. People are nice to me off the bat but the I start feeling nervous and making unnecessary eye contact and it gets ruined from there. I have opportunities to make friends, but I self sabotage. I’m losing hope
