  Hello guys! This is a questionnaire I've created for my master's thesis in psycho-sexology.   
I have already posted it on this subreddit, but I got o many answers from you, that I'm posting it again in case you didn't have a chance to see it!  
The point of this survey is to find out more about gamer's sex life and satisfaction, so if you play computer or console games feel invited to fill!   
Hope you would find it interesting.

This will take you about 8 minutes, thank you for taking your time to be a part of my survey!
