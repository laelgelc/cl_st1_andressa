Christmas Eve is joyful for some, but for many it’s complicated. We picture Christmas as family dinners, laughter, and perfect moments, but not everyone gets that version. For some, it’s the first Christmas without a parent or a child. For others, the first after a painful divorce. For many parents, it’s an empty home or distant children. And for others, it’s another Christmas spent alone.

Not everyone lives a Hallmark movie. Sometimes Christmas is a reminder of what’s missing. So how do you honor Christmas when it hurts?

1. If you’re grieving, honor the person you love. Feel what you need to feel and remember that they would want you to keep living and finding meaning.
2. If you’re rebuilding after divorce, accept that this is a season of new traditions—ones you get to create.
3. If you’re facing an empty home, trust that you did your part. Your children will return carrying the fruit of everything you poured into them.

You don’t have to celebrate Christmas the way anyone else expects. Celebrate it in the way that makes sense for your life right now.
