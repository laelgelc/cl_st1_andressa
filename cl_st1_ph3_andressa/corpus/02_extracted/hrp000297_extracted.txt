Like the title says, I’ve given up. On finding anyone. I’ve tried the dating apps, and the women on there seem to be fake or just want money. I’ve been told I’m decent looking (I was told after asking impartial people over the years), even if my self esteem issues tell me otherwise. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so I don’t feel comfortable going out to bars. In previous relationships, I’ve always felt like I could never be myself, and yet when I AM myself, I’m always alone. 

I just wish there could be a hard reset on how relationships work. That way there would be no expectations or assumptions about how everything “should be.”
