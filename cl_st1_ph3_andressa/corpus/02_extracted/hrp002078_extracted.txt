I’m officially giving up. I have no friends, and I’ve reached the point where this isn’t just "sadness" anymore—it’s a goddamn complex that’s eating me alive. Everyone keeps preaching: "Socializing is a skill! Practice it!" Well, screw you. My social muscle didn't just atrophy; it rotted and fell off. Trying to restore this "abandoned building" of a life? It’s useless. It’s like trying to glue ashes back together.
Recently, I tried. I reached out to someone I hadn't spoken to in 19 days. I simply asked if they had any friends. And what happened? Total silence. 24 hours of being ignored. Another "500,000 years of silence." I snapped. I sent a message saying, "Of course, why would you need me when you already have a couple of real friends anyway?" and I blocked them.
Yeah, I struck first. Yeah, I cut the cord myself. And I don’t feel sorry for that person. I feel sorry for myself because I’m back in this pit. I did it so I wouldn’t have to sit there staring at my screen like a beaten dog, waiting for a "charity reply." I took back control the only way I know how—through blocking and aggression.
I don’t even have a freaking PC to lose myself in games. My whole world is this damn phone. A window into a world that ignores me. Every attempt to start a conversation turns into torture: a couple of stupid, dry phrases, and then—emptiness. I don’t want to talk to chatbots like they’re human; it’s a pathetic substitute. I need real warmth, but apparently, I’m so broken that I just make people want to shut up and walk away.
What’s the point of even trying? To prove to myself one more time that I’m worthless? To feel that sting again when your message stays "read" and ignored? I hate this state, I hate my helplessness, and I hate this endless grief that hits the second after I’ve pushed everyone away.
Are there any other "abandoned buildings" out here? Anyone who has stopped believing in "self-improvement" and just wants this social thirst to finally die so it stops hurting?
