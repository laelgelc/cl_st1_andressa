In Argentina there’s this phrase from a comic book that roughly translates to “nobody saves themselves”, but I now realize that it is incomolete: nobody saves themselves but no one will do it for you. A while ago I built this cocoon, this hideaway to keep the pain and fear (therefore people too) but it ended up becoming a prison I couldn’t escape, so I waited years for someone who would pull me out but no one ever did. This made me realize that I was in dire need for help but the main motor of change in my life could come from no other than myself, I had to take initiative and I had to walk the path out of my lonely hell with my loved ones beside me, but I could’t be carried through it.
