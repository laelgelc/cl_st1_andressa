45m who has never been in a relationship. I’ve been working hard to lose weight, have more confidence and put myself out there, but it’s been hard.  I am doing fine on the losing weight part, but still have a long way to go and although I’ve been working the apps hard to find someone to even just go on a coffee date with, I haven’t really had much success. 

I’ve convinced myself that I love being and living alone (which I think I do to some extent) because I didn’t really have another option. After a brief encounter with someone in an open relationship I had my first glimpse of what being in a relationship could look like and have been pretty depressed ever since. 

I’m going to continue to look for love, but in the meantime want to make a bucket list of things I’ve never experienced so that I have something to motivate me. Anything I’m missing?

\- Holding someone’s hand while driving

\- Kissing someone on NYE

\- Cuddling on the couch watching a movie

\- Making breakfast in bed for someone

\- Cooking a romantic candlelight meal  

\- Taking a trip with someone 

\- An impromptu slow dance for no reason
