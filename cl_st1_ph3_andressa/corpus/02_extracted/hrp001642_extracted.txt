Hey

I've been feeling pretty lonely lately and I wanted to open up about it here, hoping maybe some of you can relate or have advice.

I didn't grow up in the city I live in, so I missed out on making those long-term friends from school that a lot of people seem to have.

I work as a solo gig worker, which means I don't naturally make connections like you would in an office setting. It's tough.

I try to go to events to meet people, but it's hit or miss.

Sometimes it feels like people don't really value new connections because they have so many options, or maybe it's just too much effort to keep meeting up.

It's hard dropping everything to meet someone, especially when the initial excitement fades and reality sets in.

Does anyone else feel lonely as well?

What are the main barriers for you to making and keeping friends?

Is it our busy lifestyles, work demands, societal expectations, or something else like fear of meeting creeps or just the effort it takes to maintain relationships?

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thanks for listening.
