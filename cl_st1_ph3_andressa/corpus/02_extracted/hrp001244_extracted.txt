Right before the year ended, I realized someone I considered a close friend was actually dishonest and sharing my personal vulnerabilities behind my back. I tried to end the friendship peacefully, but it kept dragging on and became emotionally draining, so I eventually blocked them.

Now that it’s the new year, I feel completely alone. I don’t really have anyone to talk to outside my family, and the isolation has been hard. Part of me regrets cutting them off, even though I know the friendship wasn’t healthy or sustainable.

This past year has brought a lot of loss, moving back home, losing friendships, losing my first love, and a sense of who I used to be. It feels like everything familiar is shedding away. 

How do you cope with this kind of loneliness and transition, what keeps you hopeful that better people will come along?
