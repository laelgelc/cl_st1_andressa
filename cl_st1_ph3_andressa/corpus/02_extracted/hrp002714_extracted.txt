I am a 29 year old guy from the UK. I don't have any friends. Every time I do make new ones, it just ends up in the same way, they always end up ignoring me and then I back to square one. Being completely alone. It's really getting me down. I try so hard, I'm always there for everyone. If they need me, I'm there.

Now it's got to the point that I'm so anxious to make any new friends as I don't want it to end exactly the same way. The more times it happens, the more down I become.

I'm just fed up with being alone and not have anyone in my life.
