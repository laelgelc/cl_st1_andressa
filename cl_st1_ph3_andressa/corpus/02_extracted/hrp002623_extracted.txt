tw: isolation 

a couple days ago i was talking to a friend and i realized it was my choice not to be social and it was my choice to leave friend groups and it was my choice to just be on my own and i liked it, i enjoyed being alone or so i thought bc i also realized i have basically no one that cares about me and it was also my choice because i chose to be alone, now i regret it and it’s dumb... it was my decision to delete social media and people from my contact list so i also got to see over the weeks who was a real one so i’m also grateful for it
