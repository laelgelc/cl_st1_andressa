After the divorce, I felt sad about the failure, but I was excited about the future.  I was relieved it was over; I was glad to be free of him.  That is to say, there were more good feelings than bad.  As time has passed, I have come to feel down.  Depressed, really.  It can't be him.  I can't be missing him or the marriage.  Maybe it is just the struggle, financial and otherwise.
