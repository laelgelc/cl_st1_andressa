I feel detached from everyone. I’m a 25-year-old man from Morocco who just got back to university after a few years away. I had to take a crappy job for a while, but I kind of miss it now. I got my baccalaureate as an independent student after four years of trying and failing—not because the material was too hard, but because I couldn’t get myself to study.

Now, I’ve finally made it, and I thought college would be different. For a little while, it was. I was doing okay and keeping up with the work. But over the past few days, I’ve started slipping into a familiar rut—I can’t even get myself out of bed.

What bothers me the most is how detached I feel from everyone. All my peers are out there living their lives, and I feel left behind. I don’t feel connected to my classmates. I feel alone.
