i was a whoops, my parents were 46 and 42 when i was born. 

i had brothers 10 years ,20 years, and 23 years older than me..

i was always more mature for my age. learned alot from my parents but never close to my brothers since they were well on their way with their lifes(lives) and never around..

but was always aroundpeople in mt life (not Family) AKA social butterfly, i felt like i was the youngest (envied by others) and SNAP i am the oldest of the people around me. i love people, i always look to help others, but all of a suddend im the lost old guy? i want to help , but feel like im more in the way
