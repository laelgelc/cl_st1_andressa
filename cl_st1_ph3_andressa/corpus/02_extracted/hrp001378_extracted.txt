Hello all. A little back story. I’m in a lonely marriage. I’m not here to look for another woman to fill the void of my wife not talking to me. I just don’t have any true friends that live near by. A lot of them used me for my resources when I was younger. So I’ve learned to ignore the fake ones. And talk with real ones. But I live in middle of nowhere. Compared to real friends. Just looking to talk with people.
