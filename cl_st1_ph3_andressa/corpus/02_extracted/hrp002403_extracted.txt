I (19M) am an awkward gay guy whos never dated anyone seriously my entire life. I've been overly mentioning to my friends recently how much I love the cheap, warped looking teddies at my local pharmacy that they stock for Valentines Day gifts; half joking, half secretly hoping they care and get me one platonically. I realize how pathetic that must seem. I just want someone to really see me and acknowledge the small things, but thats not something I can force. Since the holiday is coming up, I figured I might fulfill my 'ole middle school dreams myself and get a basket of treats I would want someone to get me. Heart shaped chocolate, an ugly teddie, and maybe a plant I can keep by my bedside. But even that idea seems pathetic to me. I'm afraid that even if I go through with it, the bear will only remind me of that one time I bought myself gifts out of sheer loneliness. I'm stuck between putting the idea aside and staring at the Valentines section every time I pick up my meds.
