For those who have been single for a while. How do you deal with that lonely feeling of not receiving that "good morning" text anymore or having someone to genuinely confide in who cares? I honestly miss those days where we could ramble on for days about absolutely nothing. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't go back to an ex because they're your ex for a reason. But that depressing alone feeling won't go away. My phone now barely gets any notifications besides updates about local news. I've joined some clubs to make some in real life friends but it just doesn't feel the same. I just miss that feeling of being wanted by that one person 😕.
