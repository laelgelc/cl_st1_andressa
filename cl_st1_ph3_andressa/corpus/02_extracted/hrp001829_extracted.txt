I left my family and gf, because my mom always insisted on shit like my future and doing a career abroad to make me a well rounded person and then enjoy my gf later cuz my "future" is more important. Let me tell you, I regret listening to her at all, the level of misery and depression can't be described with words, I have so much hatred against society cuz nobody, not even my ex highschool friends wrote me on instagram or contacted me to ask how I'm doing. This is not the future I wanted, the type of loneliness I feel is equivalent of a 80 yo man with no family.
