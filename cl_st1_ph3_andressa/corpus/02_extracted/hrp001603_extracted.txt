I really can't take it anymore, I really can't. By nature, I'm a positive person, even though I'm totally physically dependent, but right now I feel so helpless, so overwhelmed by the things happening around me. My husband has been out of work for eight months. I also live with my mother. My husband's brother now has a lot of problems too, and it's most likely he'll come to live with us. But living with four people on just one income, which is my pension, that's terrible. Besides that, he's not a very good person, although after he had a stroke and is now almost going blind, and is also quite physically dependent, it seems he has changed, or maybe it's just vulnerability and he acts like that because he has no other option. Also, he always fights with his partner. She always says she loves him, then says they don't want to be together, and my husband is always in the middle of it. He doesn't want to leave him out, and he was almost always spending all his time with him, and I feel horrible because I can't do anything in any way. One side of me understands that you have to help a person who is physically dependent, but on the other hand, I think that maybe he should somehow figure out how to live and what to do with his life, but the problem is that apart from my husband, he has no one. And I've always been a sociable person, I always try to be positive, taking into account my physical problems, my disabilities, but now I'm in a time when I don't know how to treat people because I think that if I'm in a bad mood, I might say something bad to someone unintentionally, and I can't talk about these things with my husband either because he tells me that we don't have another option either, since we can't leave his brother on the street. I hope the translator translates everything well, and thanks for reading.
