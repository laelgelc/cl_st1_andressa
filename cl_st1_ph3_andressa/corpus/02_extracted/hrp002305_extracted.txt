Hi. 

I’m a high school senior (male)

What i’m about to say probably isn’t significant and is just a part of life, but i’m hoping that putting this into words will help me calm down a bit.

I feel so lonely and empty. I feel like there’s this hole in me, and no matter what I do, it’s never filled. I love my friends and family, but i feel like i’m just the back-up friend. I’m always asking “what happened?” or laughing at inside jokes i don’t understand. I could never ask them if i am though. Because then i would look insecure, which might isolate me more. the worst part is, i get overly attached to people. i get jealous when my friend has a good time with someone else, even though im nothing special and I shouldn’t be expecting anything. everyone around me has someone, whether that be a best friend or a partner. but not me. 

Recently i’ve started to hate my voice and the way I laugh and speak. I feel like there’s always an awkward silence after I say something. jokes fall flat, i laugh a bit too long. I might be paranoid but that’s what it feels like. 

A bit over a year ago, i had similar issues. And i ended up self-harming for a while. I managed to stop and have not done it since but tonight, im getting that urge again. and I don’t want to start again. The worst part about this whole thing is, i might be doing it for attention as well. I would intentionally roll up my sleeve or leave bloody tissues lying around. 

i hate myself for thinking i deserve better, and expecting people to react to my stupid actions and choices. I am sorry for the aimless rambling and the probably shallow and sad fishing story. and thank you to whomever takes their time to read this.
