I've had a hard time leaving the house for some time now. I'm a pretty okay person, went to school, got educated, had friends jobs etc but as I've gotten older my mental health concerns started showing up in the form of extreme social phobia. Being around strangers is terribly frightening. I haven't had a panic attack in some time but I haven't been able to connect with my peers or anyone in general. I hardly reach out to family these days and I don't have a soul I could reach out to irl.

It's a lonely existence to want something so bad but feeling unable to ever achieve it.

That's all thanks for reading I guess
