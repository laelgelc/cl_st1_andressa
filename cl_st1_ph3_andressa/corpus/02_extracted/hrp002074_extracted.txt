21m -Between drug addict parents, a dead brother, a sister that's in prison for unknowingly lacing my cousin, being passed between foster homes my whole life. Now I live in a family friend's house slowly putting my life together. With no actual mother or father figure, no sibling connection, loss of all my friends through moving, what in the actual fuck do I do? 
The woman I loved more than anything turned out to not actually give a damn about me, I'm fit, 6,1 and decent looking so that's not the problem.
It's gotten to the point that I could care less about making more friends. 
Only thing that took my mind off of it was love which I don't even believe to be real anymore 
It's hard not to be a nihilist sometimes 

Only things this teaches me is being unfit for love makes you even more unfit for love 
A world with nothing to pour my heart out too
