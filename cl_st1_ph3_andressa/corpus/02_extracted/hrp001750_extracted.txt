I’m 27f, I’ll be 28 this year but I haven’t had a true connection or friend since high school. 

I am surrounded by family that I love and I have a job for the first time that I am actually enjoying and not dreading going every morning. But I’m still so devastatingly lovely. I try to open up to allow myself to make friends but it just never pans out. I am very socially awkward but I believe I mask pretty well but even when I try to open up and be friendlier I still can’t even make any true connections. All my coworkers are nice and I feel like I could be friends with them, but I’ve always been the one where they’ll make plans around me but never invite me. 

I want friends and I want you know to have a significant other but if I can’t make friends how on earth can I get something like that? 

I feel like the older I get the more lonely and isolated I feel. Everyone in my family has a family and I’m just alone. I feel very left behind. At this point, I have given up. I’ve tried opening my heart, but I just end up forgotten every time when I’ve thought I found someone willing to be my friend.
