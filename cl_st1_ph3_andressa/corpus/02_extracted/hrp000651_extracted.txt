So yeah, just wanna let this out somewhere.
There’s this girl I’ve been talking to for 4 years. She didn’t wish me on my birthday. Later only I got to know she actually didn’t even remember when my birthday was. She’s in a relationship now, so maybe I’m not her priority anymore. I told myself it’s fine, she has her own life, right?

But what really hit me harder was my 9 year old friend. He knows my birthday. Still, nothing. Not even a simple “happy birthday da”. He’s also in a relationship now. Everyone’s busy, everyone’s got someone. I get it.

This year nobody wished me. Not even one close person.
And a month later he calls me and says “bro my girl’s birthday is coming, I bought her a gift da, how to send it to her?”
I laughed it off but honestly, that one moment just crushed me inside.

It’s not even about the birthday wish. It’s about feeling forgotten by people who once made you feel like you mattered. I didn’t expect gifts or big things… just a simple “hey bro happy birthday” would’ve meant a lot.

I don’t know man, maybe I care too much. Maybe I expect too much. But it just hurts when you realize you don’t hold the same place in people’s hearts anymore.
