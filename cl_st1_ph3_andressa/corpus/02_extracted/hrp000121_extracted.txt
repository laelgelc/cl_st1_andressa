Hello fellow gamers out searching for peeps to connect to game perhaps chill, and maybe yap a bit (or not — I’m more of a listener anyway). Been collecting mfs to VC with while gaming, and I’d love to grow that that roster anyone can be my pal no pressure but do mind my somewhat horrible communication been working on that 
Games I’m Currently Playing (and open to more 
* Battlefield 6
* Marvel Rivals
* Fortnite (haven’t played since the Miku event)
* Overwatch 2 (play it every once in a while am a decent tank or just ass)
* Dead by Daylight (don’t expect me to hit those skill checks :( )
* Peak
* Left 4 Dead
* Killing Floor 2
* Lethal Company
* R.E.P.O
* Monster Hunter: World & Wilds
* Phasmophobia (still don’t know what I’m doing half the time)
Mostly I’m just vibing if that’s your energy too, we’ll probably get along great. Always down to try new games as well.
Other Stuff I’m Into:
* Anime (haven’t watched much lately — last one was an isekai with shopping powers)
* Random TikToks (I’ll probably send you some edits or something like that).   

Thanks for listening to my Ted talk folks
