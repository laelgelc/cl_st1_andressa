I can’t sleep, starting thinking about all three of my years of college thus far, and breaking it down to see how long I’ve been living without consistent friends. Now I think I’ve started derealizing. I can’t say for sure but it feels like it normally does when nothing feels real and it seems like life is just passing me by. I feel it in my chest and I hate it.
