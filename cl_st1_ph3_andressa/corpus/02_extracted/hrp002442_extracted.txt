I know this sounds like a silly problem, and it probably is, but there are some movies I'd like to see, but I know that doing so would depress me for a long time, and I feel like I need and would like to see those movies with someone else so I can express myself and let off steam. But it couldn't be with my family because I'd be embarrassed for them to see me like that. I'd like to see them with a gf

:(
