I have no one, never had anyone even have a remote interest in me. I try to have my shit together, continuously work on my self and still have no luck.

I don't plan to give up, I'm just sick of it. sometimes I keep saying "I rather be alone" because I legit have no one. 

Any advice. Never had a valentines day, never had someone say "I miss you" never had someone want to spend even a day with me. I'm 20 and struggling
