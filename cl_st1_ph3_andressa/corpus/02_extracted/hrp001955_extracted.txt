I don’t really feel like I have any friends, just acquaintances. A lot of my contacts fell apart over the last few months due to various reasons. I’m still in contact with maybe one or two people but they all feel like only acquaintances at this point. I had one guy try to be my friend for a while but he totally disappeared. 

Anyone else going through this?
