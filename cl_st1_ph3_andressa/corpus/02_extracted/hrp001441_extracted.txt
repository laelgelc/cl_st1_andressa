I wanna be a father so bad! But I know thats not in the cards for me. I don’t think **”we’re all here for a reason, etc”** or any of that nonsense. I think life is a just a series of meaningless chemical & biological accidents, & we’re the idiots who’ve assigned meaning to it. 
I really don’t want to be alone forever. I feel like I have so much love to give mm I want to give it. I wanna spread it but now in the future, there’s artificial beings that are replacing what normal used to be so life is becoming…. difficult.

If anyones in a similar boat…idk, don’t be a stranger
