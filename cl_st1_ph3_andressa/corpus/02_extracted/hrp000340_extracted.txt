Silence has a way of  talking. It's the empty plspace not being filled that keeps a person anxious yet clam. It ironic how there is this big room to do anything and everything the imagination can ponder, yet the choice to sit in comfort, ALONE, in silence is how time sends a message between old friends and new friends. However in that silence, the soul  also has a way showing the spirit that when peace found alone , the worries of old friends and new friends is no longer bothersome.
