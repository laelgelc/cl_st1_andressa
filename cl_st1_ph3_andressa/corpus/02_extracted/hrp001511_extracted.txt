I've been struggling a lot lately. There is this lingering and aching feeling in my chest and these visions in my head that I will never ever experience love in this life, meaning romantic love, but not the one with candles lit up and roses all over bed, what I have in mind is to actually having a partner that there is to support you and you are there to support them and together you build a whole new world, trust that does not shutter and you truly love each other.

I have never experienced love or a loving relationship ever. And even though I got used to being alone and I usually enjoy being "a solitaire", from time to time I break down because I don't have that genuine and loving connection, I don't have my soulmate -- and I feel very lonely at times. And I am really scared I will never get to experience that. Of course, I have friends that I adore, but it's just not the same as having a partner.

I just cannot imagine that I may never get to know how it feels when someone truly loves you. I am petrified I will stay alone until the end of my life.

  
I am not looking for reassurance or kind words that I will certainly find someone. I am just wondering if someone feels the same, if there is any other soul that is going through this.

Thank you.
