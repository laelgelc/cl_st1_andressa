Hi Reddit folks, I’m looking for some support or suggestions. I’ve never really had close friends in my life, and about two years ago I finally made one, but she moved away for her career. Since then she’s made new friends, and when I message her she either replies very late or not at all, usually with reasons like being tired or busy. Now I feel like I’m back to zero, and I’m struggling with the loneliness—how can I cope with this feeling and refocus on my own life?
