I just feel really lonely. I wish that I had someone who wants to be loved and who wants to love me and someone who just genuinely enjoys my company as much as I do theirs. I don’t want to be too scared to close my eyes incase they will leave like everyone has done in the past. I don’t know if I can let my guard down like that again.

I know that I’m nothing special and most people deserve so much more than to be burdened with me and maybe that’s what people realise when they decide to disappear.

I just feel so empty at the moment. I don’t know how to be content with that.
