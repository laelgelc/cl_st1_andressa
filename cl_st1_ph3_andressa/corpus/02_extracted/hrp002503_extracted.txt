Hi I’m new to this group and to Reddit in general  so here goes

Hi I’m (39m) been really down lately. I feel like I can be seen but not heard. I thought just talking and cracking jokes was enough but deep down I’m just lost 😞 every time I go to work I just want to jump off the building and be done with my life. I don’t really have any friends or anyone to talk to because I get scared to open up to anyone and I really struggle to know what to say or do. As I’ve gotten older I feel like I’ve missed my opportunities to have friends and try to find connections like I did and it’s getting harder to fake being happy. I try my best but it just feels like I’m only surviving in life rather than living and finding connections is getting less likely to come true. All I do is wake up and work all day. Maybe one day someone will see me and actually want to be my friend without asking for money or selling me something.. is it hopeless out there or does everyone think there might still be a chance?…
