I had to say goodbye to my dog Blue. I stayed up all night not wanting the morning to come but it was inevitable. I know the world will hate me but in true fashion the only other way other than crying uncontrollably I can express myself…is through a damn Taylor lyric. All that comes to mind is “missing him was dark and gray, all alone.” Right now it’s how i feel like I’ll feel the rest of my life. I feel like my days are somber and I just don’t know how to let it go. I feel ok for a minute and then it hits me. I have to go back to work tomorrow I’m terrified. I held onto him the entire time and when he was officially gone it felt like my entire chest caved in. He was the best friend I needed at 21 and was my ride or die for 15 years I’ll have a lot to pine about 💙
