So this might be not the right place to post, but I want to get some advice because I don't really have anyone to share this with. So lately I wasn't feeling really great, because I was thinking of some life stuff, and it made me fill not well, I mean I have a pretty weak nervous system, and my character can be not good sometimes. I mean I remember all my life I was always a bit weird, and felt like I'm not in the right plate, and be not like others. So I only had about 2-3 school friends. I used play video games and do internet stuff a lot, procrastination, so that also had an impact on me, I managed to quit gaming and other bad interests though, but I recently just felt like I woke up and started to do something in life, I don't have a job now, so I can't pay for therapy or go to some clinic, so I'm a bit stuck.
