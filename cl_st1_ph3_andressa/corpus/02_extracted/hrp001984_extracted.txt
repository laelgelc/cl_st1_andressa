I'm lonely, which is obvious because I'm posting here. I don't have anyone in real life to talk to about this so maybe I can see if someone here can relate to me or give me advice lol.

I've been depressed since I was a kid and I was an outcast. Talking to new people makes me anxious. Finally I'm around people I like, some I am closer to some I am not and that's fine and normal but I'm scared that they're making fun of me whenever I turn my back. I try to be friendly and helpful and I feel like that's being exploited. I also feel that I'm growing out of my friendships I'm in now and because of that I feel stuck since it's obvious I am not able to socialize properly to get new friends. This is so confusing and idk what to do lol.

Edit

I also think that this feeling is starting to make me more mean and angry, I don't like it but idk what else to do.
