I tried to confide in my family how alone I felt and what a failure I felt like, their suggestion was to leave home and get my Masters. Start anew, get great opportunities.

Now I’m in tons of student debt, working a job that’s nowhere NEAR what I wanted to do with my life, but when I tell my family I want to go home, they tell me “not unless you find a better job here”, which is, you guessed it, impossible.

I was in a rough spot, but I had friends, I had crushes. I had my family. They were right there, and now I only get to go home twice a year and I’m barely even in my nephews’ lives. I’m shocked they even know who I am.

I just really hate being alone. My family always loved how independant I am, but the truth is I need them. I’ve always needed them. So fucking bad.

I don’t care how good the picture looks, I fucking hate my life here. I just want to go home
