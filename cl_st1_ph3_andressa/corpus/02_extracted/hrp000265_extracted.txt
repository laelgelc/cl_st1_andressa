No to be over dermatic but I live in a small town that is in the middle of the desert really sucks.
As a skateboarder there isn’t a skatepark that isnt worth time or anything special and the streets have cracks and the roads have pot hole and the tumble weeds take over the streets in the summer.
Can anybody relate?
