It probably wears down any positive mental health. You become kinda resentful, kinda angry, kinda willing to be aggressive and not be open to anything with anyone because I know they're lying and preying. Cause that's people. Brains stuck in the ape kingdom. I feel so wild like my mind just can't and won't function like a normal person would, and part of me is stubborn to the point that I won't bother to do so either just to be with the same people that wouldn't bother to be human
