I am 19 years old and i’m a freshman in college. I have no friends and i’ve never felt so alone in my entire life. It’s a saturday night and it’s every night that i just watch people all around me go out and have fun without having friends. I’ve tried reaching out and making plans with people and it just seems that nobody wants to do anything with me. I’m just so tired. I want friends , i want people to have fun and laugh with, i want something to make me feel better. I just don’t really know if i can live like this forever. I want to do better and be a better version of myself.
