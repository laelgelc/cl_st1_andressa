You know, there is a party going on next week and since school is ending this week, i thought it might be good to go for a change. The only problem is i dont have any friends to go with. I literally dont have anyone to with. As much as i already thought about going alone, i cant. My parents wont let me go alone. I already asked my cousins but all they said that they found weird me going to a party since i am more of a stay at home girl. I think they find it weird going with me and also dont want to. should i just not go ? or what else can i do? Im 16 by the way
