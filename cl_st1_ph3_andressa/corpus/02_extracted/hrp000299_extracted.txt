Last year I spent my birthday alone, and it was one of my favorite birthdays I’ve ever had. I went to my favorite burrito place, drove to a state park, and went for a long hike with my dog. 

I’ll be spending this birthday alone again and can’t help wanting to recreate how happy I was on that day, but 1) it’ll be about 20 degrees colder this year, and 2) I’m dealing with a knee injury and can’t walk very far. I’ve been doing a lot alone lately, and ngl it’s weighing on me, so it’s especially important to me this year that I take myself on a fulfilling “me date.”

I like thrifting and antiquing and will probably end up at my favorite coffee shop in the morning, but I would love to get out in nature somehow. Any recommendations?
