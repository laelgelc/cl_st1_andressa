there is nothing inherently wrong with my life. Everything is fine, great even. I’ve chosen this life or you could say that I decided not to settle for the sake of it. Most days I’m this happy perky person, not taking anything too seriously. But then there are days like today when out of nowhere I get consumed by this unexplainable feeling that how did I end up here? As in with no friends or anyone to share my life with. I don’t mind this life at all because I know what I was going into when I made the choices I made but still on days like these I low key worry for myself. Everyone used to tell me I’m the kind of person who’ll always end up finding people for herself. But somehow my life turned out to be the opposite…I never give too much thought to such days when they come. But today I really need someone to tell me it’s going to be okay.
