Idk why. Way too much anxiety; the first week of college, before corona, i started feeling it, now i got a job on a call center just to survive. and man, i really really don't enjoy being there. Although people are nice, i want to be alone. Idk, maybe i always an introverted trying so hard to be social, but idk, i liked it that way

Edir: school\*\*
