This is the only place I have to vent or even speak my mind. I’m 42 divorced and have no friends. I have no way to make any either since I don’t drink and hate everything about bars, meetups or wherever else people supposedly meet friends. I sit in my apartment alone and wait for Monday to come so I can work to pay for my apartment. I basically pay rent on a cage to sleep. All I do is sleep. It makes the days go by faster. I don’t want to be alone forever and that’s why/how I know I will be. This sucks and I wonder why I keep doing anything.
