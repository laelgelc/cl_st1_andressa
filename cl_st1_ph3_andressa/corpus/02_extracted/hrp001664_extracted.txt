It's been 3 months since I graduated university. I obviously had to move back home with my parents in a bit of town where I only had a few friends from secondary school. All these friends have now moved away to different universities and I am now all alone and I am so bored and sad everyday due to the loneliness. My best mate from uni got into a relationship around 5 months ago and I literally very rarely get to speak to him anymore because he is busy with his girlfriend and he works 2 jobs. I on the other hand was dumped 5 months ago on the same day my friend got his girlfriend so you can see hoe shitty that must feel. I also seem to be unemployable as I have applied for 146 jobs and I haven't had a single interview even though whilst at university I had a job working as a waiter. Life just seems so slow moving now and I don't have anything to do to fill my time as I just hate being on my own all yhe time and I don't know where to find or make friends in my city anymore. I don't see anyone my age hanging around. Anyone else have similar issues?
