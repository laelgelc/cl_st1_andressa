Ever look in the mirror and realise 
“That’s me.”? 
I can’t go about my life looking like this, I’m so much bigger than everyone else my age. Even the girls who used to be the same size as me have now lost the weight and I’m all alone to hate myself. I shower in the dark, get dressed with my eyes closed, won’t participate in sports inside or outside of school. I HATE MYSELF. When does this change? I’ve lost 2 stone but I’m still fat asf. I feel like nobody else feels like this.
