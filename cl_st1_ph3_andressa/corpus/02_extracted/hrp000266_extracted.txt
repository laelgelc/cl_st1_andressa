This is my current issue I'm having to figure out how to deal with. I meet these really nice people but I don't feel like I have the energy to keep up with these friendships and get to know new people right now! I cannot stand being facetimed and texted all day after I have been open and honest with these people  saying I'm really not in a place where I want to actually have a friendship. They don't understand it and keep texting me various days, multiple times a day. Does anyone else go through this? I am taking 6 months to just focus on myself and I don't see a problem with that.
