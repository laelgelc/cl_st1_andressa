Hi, new to the subreddit and figure me I’d share my story. I’ll try to make it quick haha

32M (recently) Have been married, through all sorts of relationships, and through many connections that didn’t last as like as I’d like. Growing up I remember the adults having real conversations with complete strangers, what happened with that? I understand the day and age we’re in now is.. different. But, that genuine human connection seems to be missing throughout our society
