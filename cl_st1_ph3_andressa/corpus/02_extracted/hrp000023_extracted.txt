So.
I guess first I'm trans MtF and met this cool girl who sees me as one.
Co workers on work (m\f they know I'm trans) said she is horny on me and her behaviour was aligning with that. It was perfect.

She was saying she has a crush on someone but I thought it was teasing - it was like that and a very good (female) friend of mine said that it's just that don't worry bout it.

So today she visited me. We were kuddling all cute and lovely. She says let's kiss. We set on to it.

She pulls back, says we are just really good friends.

That's it we laid here for longer played a little bit. You know cuddling together tickling one another and she said again before leaving for home we are just friends.

Just thanks for reading this I guess.
