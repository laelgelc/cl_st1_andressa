If I kms, nobody would know, probably for a week or more. I'm disconnected from my family, I don't have any friends, a partner, nothing. I'm working a shitty minimum wage job and live alone. I honestly don't want to keep on going, and I might just do it. I really have nothing left to lose. Ig if anyone wants to post wants to, go for it, but idk if I'll respond.
