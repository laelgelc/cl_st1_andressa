Hi everyone, i turn 30 tomorrow and this past 2024 was the loneliest year i’ve experienced. I have a lot of sorrow and pain. Does anyone have any tips on having a positive outlook on life ? I’m also latina and i feel ashamed to still be single at 30. Most if not all of my cousins are married. I feel like people look at me with pity and fear that they don’t want to be in my situation. My sister is 26 and getting married in November. I’ve made peace with it, but i think at the wedding people are going to talk about me and how i’m still single. I’m hoping to be able to bring a plus one, a man i would be dating at least. I only have one male friend and he has a gf so no way i would ask him to accompany me. I just feel so hopeless.
