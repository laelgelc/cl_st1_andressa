Im in my last year of highschool, i go to college next year and i have a lot of big exams coming up in the next few days. In my school my friendgroup thats in my class dropped me out of nowhere, and it makes me really lonely, theres no one else to talk to. During exams i have to stay in school longer and i see them laugh and hangout. And idk if its cause of that but i have no motivation to do anything right now. Who cares about anything else itll all be the same, i have no motivation to study or do anything, even bath. i dont feel like dressing up, parents dont let me meet friends due to exams being so near and i just feel so out of touch and pointless. i just rot in bed and scroll on my phone and feel like eating or watching youtube. I really want to get out of this hole. I used to obsessed with becoming rich and working hard and now im at a place where i dont care if im rich or not whats the point of it all. Id really love some help from people who have been through this before and have left this mindset. Thank you for reading all this. Ive also been really anxious to go to school lately which is why i havent been going. mainly due to the stress of going there and knowing theres friends that dropped me and are now hanging out with my friend group after ditching me and ignoring me, They didnt even give a proper reason except say its been on their mind for a long time and it rlly hurt me and im just so lost right now. its taking a toll on my education.
