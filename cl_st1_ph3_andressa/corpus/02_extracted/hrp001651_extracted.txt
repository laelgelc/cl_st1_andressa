I don’t use Reddit a lot or even at all and this is my first post and I don’t even know if anyone would see this but I’m so tired of living here I feel like I don’t even have a reason or purpose anymore or like I ever did it’s like I’m staying for nothing. It’s like people used to care but over time they just stopped.. and all I do is put everything into a relationship all the reaching out responding effort time and energy when no one ever does the same.. I just want someone to care about me and put the same amount of time energy and effort into the relationship I want someone to say goodnight and good morning to me someone to call someone that invites me to hang out and I know this’ll sound weird but someone to hug cuddle or snuggle with I’m just so attention affection and touch starved/deprived I mean I can’t even feel love from people anymore because of my trauma like it hurts it hurts so much to live and see everyone else be getting that but you. I just can’t keep doing this anymore- :c
