Spending the holidays alone doesn’t mean something’s wrong with you—it means you’ve grown too strong to settle. While friends post their holiday couple photos, you might feel the fear of being left behind. But the truth is, your independence, standards, and emotional strength are proof of growth, not weakness.

This video is your reminder:

1. Get out there—church, social groups, or online dating.
2. Never trade peace for companionship.
3. Enjoy your own space while trusting the right person will come at the right time.

You’re not hard to love—you’ve simply learned to love yourself enough to wait for someone who’s inspired by your strength.  
Follow for daily encouragement that helps you love yourself through every season. Live with purpose, lead with heart, and leave your mark.
