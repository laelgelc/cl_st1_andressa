Im still in school but I feel like I have always been isolated. I still  have a lot of people I talk to, or occasionally see and know, but I dont have anyone actually close to me. I rarely get invited out (maybe to someones birthday like after 2 months) and I dont get involved in a lot of chats or anything like that. Its easy for me to get to know anyone which is why i know a lot of diverse people but i feel like nobody values me. 

  
High school has been the worst case of this as in middle school I knew everybody, hung out pretty often and had a strong friend group.  Now I have some of those estranged friends, made new, not-close friends at this school and each year have been invited out less and less. 

  
I feel like im rotting away and dissapointing my parents as the only times I go out are for soccer when our school has it for each year or whatever we do together. 

  
I genuinely just dont understand how Im gonna get through this school knowing how lame my life is right now, and how I feel like nobody has really ever wanted that connection with me. Even the one relationship ive had didnt feel like anything more that just friends who liked eachother.

  
Its like i dont think anyone wants to get close to me and I dont know why. Im a quiet person but am still very sociable and able,  and i like a lot of different things which is how i have friends in a lot of groups. 

  
Does it really get better after high school? My goal in work is to be a travelling job so I understand the fact I wont see these people ever again its just it hurts knowing what a waste this school has been, and how alone i feel all the time.
