I really tried, I actually did. I just wanted to have my own person.. I got blocked today, I was so nice and sweet, she told me “wait i’ll be right back” just to find myself blocked. What do I even do.. I’m supposed to be likeable not get blocked because I’m just a toy to throw away. I feel used and sad.. I probably sound so pathetic don’t I? Either way, i’m not kicking the bucket far..
