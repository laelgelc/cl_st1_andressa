Our world has never been as connected as it is right now. We can talk to someone on the other side of the planet in a matter of seconds, and yet we often feel alone in our lives. It is a pandemic of loneliness. Billions of people are suffering every day, and yet no one seems to care.  I have personally suffered with loneliness through much of my life and experienced what it's like to go through a mental hell with no one to offer a helping. This is why I created this subreddit.   


So, if you are struggling with loneliness, do not be afraid to reach out to this subreddit for help. If you just want to vent your frustrations related to loneliness, then that's okay too.
