Am I the only one here who is longing for someone to feel completely vulnerable and safe with? Someone who will accept us, darkness, flaws, and all? I long for a person to tell everything to, and for them to love me keep me safe. I want a protector, I want someone to help me see the light. I want someone to be my friend and my parent. Maybe it's the trauma talking, maybe the loneliness, but every day all I want is someone to confide in, someone who won't run away or take advantage of me. Please tell me I'm not alone.
