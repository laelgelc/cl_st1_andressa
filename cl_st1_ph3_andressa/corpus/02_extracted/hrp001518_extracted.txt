I’m 24, a non-traditional student, and honestly feel “older” than everyone around me. And I don’t have a support system and I feel so sad when I see everyone else having a good time with friends and just surrounded by people. I’m tired of staying in my comfort zone, so I signed up for a full-day outdoors activity at my college tomorrow… but now my anxiety is kicking in.

I don’t know anyone and I’m scared everyone will show up in friend groups while I’m alone or be awkward bc I’m a bit older than most students.

Any advice on:
	•	How to integrate myself when I don’t know anyone?

	•	How to make friends as an older student around mostly younger people?

I really want to push myself and finally build connections. Any tips are appreciated
