Christmas came quiet.
There was no knock at the door.
The room held its shape.
The light stayed where it was.

Outside, people moved with purpose.
Inside, time moved slower.
I made coffee and let it cool.
I did not rush it.

There was no noise asking for attention.
No need to explain the day to anyone.
The silence was steady and honest.
It did not pretend to be something else.

I thought about the past but it did not weigh much.
It sat there like a chair by the wall.
Useful. Not demanding.

Others were together.
That was fine.
I was here.
That was also fine.

I ate. I rested. I stayed present.
The day passed without ceremony.
It did not need one.

I was alone on Christmas.
But I was not lacking.
I had the day.
And I had myself.
