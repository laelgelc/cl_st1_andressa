I was looking at nothing but a flickering screen since sometime. Occupying most of myself with the least tormenting of things. Its like living underneath warm and soft blankets day after day. Comfort for the price of loneliness.

And every once in a while moonlight envelops this solitude of mine and takes its toll by force. Nowhere left to run, nothing left to fight. Revealing all that is flawed. Weak and anxious and corrupt. Tied up and forced to watch all that is wrong with me, all that I am not all that I could have been. Reliving every moment of tragedy that could have been avoided if I chose pain and uncertainty instead of softness and comfort. Now instead of later.

And now I am here. 
Dont know what my heart is seeking.
And I know I am unreliable.
Please love me nonetheless.
