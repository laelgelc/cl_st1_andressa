So back in May I took a new job in Boston after 5 years of engineering work back in my hometown. I was hoping to be more social by moving to a city but I never felt more alone, I was away from the little family I have and office jobs 90% of the time it feels like I am talking to just the computer. After three months I quit and moved back, the city was too much for me, between constant noise and and living alone. I took a few months and I traveled to Europe which it's hard for people to sign up for and so I traveled alone. I have always traveled alone, I have done one other trip to Europe and a trip to Japan. I am starting a new job and I am dreading it, I feel like it will be the same thing of talking to my computer for most of the day and I have a hour commute each way. Most of my weekends are spent alone as well, I try to bike or hike, I'm on a diet so I don't eat out much as that makes it hard to stay on track and I don't drink so really no reason and somewhat awkward to go to bars. I race sailboats but that is done for the winter. Dating is also hard, I mostly do online, but I usually get like one date every 6 months or so. So I guess like my question is this isn't normal right? I feel like most people usually do something together most weekends? When I go out to like a arcade or a restaurant just to get out of the house, I'm just as alone surrounded by people as if I was sitting in my living room.
