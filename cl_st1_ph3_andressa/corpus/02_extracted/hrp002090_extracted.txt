I'm 25 f and I feel like i ruined my life.. from 18 to like 23 I hated myself intensely never socializing because I always thought I was too ugly or boring or whatever negative bullshit I told myself and I feel like I barely did anything but worked and went home. On top of all that I've had two relationships with men who didn't treat me very well and I feel like I stayed way too long so I pretty much have no one right now. Sometimes I stay up late at night crying wishing I could go back in time and start over and actually went out in the world and tried but instead I just bullied myself and hid myself away out of insecurity and I honestly have never felt lonelier in my whole life. I feel like I ruined very formative years where it was easier to socialize and now that I'm 25 I feel like most ppl I know are getting married or busy with work and it just feels impossible making friends.
