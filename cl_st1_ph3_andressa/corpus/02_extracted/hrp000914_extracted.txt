I just want to take a moment to thank the moderators here for this subreddit. I have been part of a few lonely subreddits and the past and they were always full of angry cynical people. But here we are just lonely people keeping each other company. It’s honestly nice and heart warming. So thank you moderators for this subreddit and thank you the creator for this subreddit for inviting me here
