Since middle school I have to fight depression. Now I'm 24, go to uni and it's worse than ever before. 
I see so much good/fun in life but sadly I can't do any of it because I'm too grumpy and alone. 
For example: I still live with my parents because I never had a friend I could move together with. I never traveled around the world because I'm too afraid to do it alone. 
I should mention that I'm epileptic so it might be dangerous to do these things alone and tbh I'm at an age where I don't want to do all of this with my parents even when they are nice. 

I recently force myself to go to things like watching a movie in the cinema alone, but i always feel empty and slightly embarrassed having to say that I'm going alone. 
Now when I force myself to go to social events I'm always grumpy and want to cry from the very beginning that I have to go there alone - not knowing anyone. This again kinda makes it impossible for me to make friends there... 

There's so much in life I would probably enjoy: ice skating, traveling, visiting random classes like cooking classes , etc. 
But none of these seem fun for me alone. I think much like in the cinema I would just feel empty going there alone at this point:(
