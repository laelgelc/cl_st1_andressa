For one another time, I am all alone. I am in college, in a far, far away city than the one I had friends in. Now even that city is empty because my friends went to other cities, too. It's my ?. week here. Here is my pseudo-friend list:
1- F-r-ee S1p!irit (google search censored): A too extroverted guy. He is the first guy I met. They say that the friends you make first are the ones that will be constant. This guy is constant, that's right, but I don't like him. His extrovertedness is harmful to me!
2- The girl that was my online friend from years ago. When I came here, she became a real friend. Though, we went to cinema and I made a joke about the IT movie and she somehow misinterpret it as a flirt attempt. This friday, I have to go watching Thor with them, especially with her again.
3- Rommates(~Roomies): They are awkward.
4- Classmates: They are social.
5- People that know me but I don't know them: Describer is describing enough.

How are you doing it?
