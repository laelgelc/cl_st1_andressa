   I'm an old dude, I don't know my age since I stopped counting, for all I care I might as well be 90. 
   I failed to kill myself becouse I'm weak I I'm just waiting for nothing,  endlessly.  I'm glad I'm not alone. Other dudes suffering gives me hope I'm not the chosen one, hell, I'll never see happiness in my life so why should anyone?!
  I'm so tired, hell, I even miss the gay guys on Facebook (Maily old farts using works hookup one liners someone with severe brain damage could muster) Aparently not wearing shirts = gayyy... I used to have so much hope for this artificial intelligence,  like finally,  a salvation,  an AI companion,  but all you need to do is look at "Replika" or some simular products and just how fast it breaks if you try to have a conversation. The irony of a chatbot failing at being capable to chat..
    I don't even have voices in my head to keep me company,  I have nothing, I didn't had conversation for so long I don't even know how to start one.
   The source of my energy is my pain,  the irony of me being more passive becouse I feel less and more energetic becouse it's unbearable,  sometimes making me want to burst out loughing uncontrollably.

P.S. You know those solders that die in Ukraine war? Well guess what, apparently I'm not good enough to join the army DESPITE my healthy body. Apparently I'm not FUCKING WORTHY TO STAND ON THE FRONT LINE, NAH SOME GOOD LOOKING FUCK THAT WILL BE MISSED BY HIS FAMILY GETS TORN APART BY RANDOM FRAG SHEL BUT NOT ME.

    I pray this whole planet would just explode one day and end it all just like that. Fuck happiness,  only missery is Real.
