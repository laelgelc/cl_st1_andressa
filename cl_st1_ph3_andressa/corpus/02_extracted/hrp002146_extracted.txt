Why do I always meet other people my age (26 F) who also claim they have “no friends” but every Friday and weekend etc. they post about going out or doing things with the same group of people who also all look like they are enjoying themselves. I only ask because it’s confusing because when I tell someone I have no friends I mean it. I don’t have a single friend. It feels like a slap in the face most times because I’m really just that alone but others can just say it lightheartedly in passing.
