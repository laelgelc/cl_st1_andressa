And I didn't really notice or be aware because my relatives basically said the opposite and I don't talk about it with other ppl because I am ashamed of my issues. But actually my life is difficult and full of pain nut noone gives a shit cuz they don't know how to handle it. Except maybe one or teo persons but i cannot tell them becaude it would be too terrible for them to know. I just want to $h and km$. This world is hell and my life is basically a shit show. It feels lile being starved mentally.
basically there has always been terror in my life but they just shrugged it away or so. i am not mad at them, they couldn't do better and all they did was from a place of true love. But I am mad at the one who created this world. why should i not devastated my arms and skin when not even the creator cares so much as to let peace and kindness prevail, why shouldn't I open that cage of flesh and bone then?
