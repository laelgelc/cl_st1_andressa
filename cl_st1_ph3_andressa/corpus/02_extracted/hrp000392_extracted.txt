Hey.

I don’t really know how to write this properly, but I’ll try to be honest.

I’m 19, mostly awake at night, and I don’t really have people to talk to right now—like genuinely none. I’m not looking for anything weird or fake, just some real online friends to talk to when nights get quiet.

I’m into late-night conversations, random deep talks, music, overthinking life, studies (trying to stay disciplined but failing sometimes 😅), and just normal chill chats. I’m more of a listener than a loud talker, and I prefer meaningful connections over big groups.

If you’re also someone who feels a bit alone, stays up late, or just wants a no-judgment conversation, feel free to message me. We can talk about anything or even nothing.

No pressure. Just vibes.
