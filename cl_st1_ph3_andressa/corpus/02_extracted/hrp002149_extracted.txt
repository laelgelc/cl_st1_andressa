Bought a ticket to a club night, don’t think I’m going anymore. It’s fine the ticket was cheap, I won’t miss the money spent. 

When I bought it, I wanted things to go differently. I wanted to become more of a person and less dependent on other people. I wanted to have new experiences and do things I couldn’t when I was younger. 

Now it’s all ruined. I ruined everything. I should’ve known better, everytime something good happens something bad happens. I should’ve never bought that ticket. I should’ve never strayed from my resolution. I’m going back to that. I’m tired of being disappointed. I don’t want anything else to look forward to, too frustrating. 

I’m staying in my room all weekend and Monday. No one will care. I’ll only come out for the bathroom and to get food. I’m not talking but I’m not rotting, I have assignments to do.
