I turned 18 at midnight tonight, i don't feel different, I'm so lost with everything in my life, I don't have friends anymore and the loneliness is driving me insane, I still have my family it's just different, they don't know me on that level, I just don't have anyone and I'm at another low of mine, I know I'll get through it, I always have gotten through everything despite what's happened anyway I've been lurking on this subreddit for awhile so I thought it was fitting for me to post for the first time on my 18 birthday.
