A few days ago , I asked a girl if she wanted to go get some drinks with me. She said yes but stated that next Saturday would be when she is available. On one hand , I am excited to be going on a date with her. On the other hand , I'm looking at the glass half empty and thinking she is probably going to flake, reject, or cancel on the date last second. 

I've had alot of rejections in the last 6 months and it's sometimes tough to keep going without thinking about my past failures in asking women on a date. 

Overall, I will try to stay positive and look forward to the date. If the date doesn't happen , I will go to a gas station and get 3 lottery tickets(I know that sounds random). Maybe me being rejected again could be the best thing to happen to me .
