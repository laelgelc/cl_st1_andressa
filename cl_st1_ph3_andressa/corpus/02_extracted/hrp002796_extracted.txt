so, i have this idea. the people that i guess would be called my friends, the ones i grew up with; they would be characters in this game. i would provide real stats such as: age, height and weight. any substance abuse as well annual income and marriage/kids. every character would be a game piece. the game pieces go on a board that isn't unlike a bingo card. on one side of the card, we have ages. the other is common causes of death. maybe some not so common as well. the order that the "friends" die determine if u win. you have to guess the order and cause of death. don't forget to include yourself.
