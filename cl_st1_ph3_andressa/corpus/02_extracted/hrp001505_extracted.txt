Every open-minded or social space gets messy fast.
Either disrespectful energy enters,
or boundaries disappear completely.

I joined a private community recently that filters people based on
intention, respect, and energy —
not looks or popularity.

Women seem to feel safe there,
which honestly surprised me in a good way.

Do other women prefer curated spaces over open ones?
