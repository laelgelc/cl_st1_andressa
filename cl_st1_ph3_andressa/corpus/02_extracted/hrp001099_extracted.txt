Hi. I'm a 28-year-old guy living in the Philippines. I'm unemployed, undergraduate and inexperience who wants to land a job that pays fair. My Fiancée and I is getting married by December this year. She does have a job, so she has money. I would like to surprise her by being the one to pay all the expenses we need for the wedding. I still have around like 10 months to prepare. Could you help a man out? I will do anything that is legal. Thank you and have a great day everyday!
