I am currently  sitting at a booth by myself drinking coffee. The place is not packed but it is busy. Old people are everywhere and I am the without a doubt the youngest  person here. I am not sure if I how I feel. I am trying to just enjoy the  idea someday I will grow old with  someone.  These people all around me seem happy. They are pretty cheerful for being awake at this time of the day. I feel out of place almost like I am from the future because I don't fit it with this crowd. A part of me does not care but a small part wonders what they are thinking of me.  I always think they think I am going to be a "dine and dash" person  . I am not but I could see how I could look the part.  My food is here so I guess I better put my phone down now. I can feel the eyes of the oldies judge me like " that kid is glued to his phone".
