A horrible statement made by "friends" when I was young still haunts me because its true. "No girl is ever gonna Talk to Sam unless she's so drunk she doesn't know what shes looking at"

Now while it would be easy to have a pity party over being ugly what gets to me is that I was never offered out drinking. I never got that social opportunity. And honestly the only people i ever managed to build a small frienship with where stoners who hated me on the days they were sober!

I really want friends, not one evening of self pity. I want people to talk to, to get good with. To laugh. To enjoy time. 

I dont want a hobby, I want a human being to respond to me
