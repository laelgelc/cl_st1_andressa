Hi. I’m 33, and lately I’ve been feeling very depressed. I’ve been living in Valencia for almost 2 years now. Over the past few years, my life has been going downhill, and I don’t know how to make it better. I feel very bad, it feels heavy, and lately I’ve also been feeling extremely lonely. Because of everything that has happened in recent years, I drifted away from my friends, and now I feel almost completely alone. Yes, I have a few acquaintances, but they’re people I can play board games with or grab a beer with, not people I can talk to heart-to-heart. I’d really like to find someone here, if not a friend, then at least a person I could genuinely enjoy spending time with.

Because right now I feel like I barely exist, and I really want to feel at least a little alive again.
