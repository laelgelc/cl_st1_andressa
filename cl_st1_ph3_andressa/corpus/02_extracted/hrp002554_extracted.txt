every time someone goes out of their way to say they will not ghost they decide to anyways, out of dozens there was only one with the common decency to say 'hey I told you I wasnt going to ghost but I think this friendship is not going anywhere so I am going to shut it down' only one what the hell is wrong with people is it really that hard. And I keep getting tricked into thinking they are good people who would not treat people badly too. Why cant people just communicate
