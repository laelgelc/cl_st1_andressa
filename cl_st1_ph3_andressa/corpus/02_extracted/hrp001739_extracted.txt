I feel like a majority of my relationships end because they majorly just screw me over but it’s like I still miss them,I can’t really explain it well but let me give a few examples, I was friends with this person for a few years and then he just suddenly started telling everyone he knew all my personal secrets I’ve been telling him and like what the fuck. It’s just like been feeling like for a very long time where all my relationships just implode because they just start hating me and I can’t even really tell if I’m the problem because like why would you tell me I don’t matter to you all after 7 years of friendship I don’t even think any context can Make that a resonable response to anything really, and then probably a 1/3 of my relationships end because just ghosted I was friends with a dude the entirety of middle school from 6-8th he got into high school I broke my phone never got a text again it’s like what the hell it’s exhausting it’s either just cruelty and hatred or they just ghost me or I’m the only person talking and it’s like what the fuck do I even do at this point it’s been a constant my whole life,and I’m just sick of tired of texting people to get barely anything back it’s fucking exhausting it feels like I’m the least important in everybody’s life at all times. It makes me feel like shit and it’s not like anybody cares about the fact they hurt me it’s just they care if it effects them and up until that point my whole life has just felt like people being cruel to me and then me just getting angry and then I’m the bad guy, it just feels fucking miserable.it just feels like I can’t be ever fucking genuine It’s awful and I’m sick of this if anybody has any advice I’d love to hear it.
