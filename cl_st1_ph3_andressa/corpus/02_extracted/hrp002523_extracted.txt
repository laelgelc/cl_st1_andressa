Why are some people in life bound to always be left alone ,isolated, depressed? 
I hate being part of it
It’s 3 a.m., and you feel that pang of loneliness, having no one on your side Desperate, you go online trying to be friendly, and they take advantage of your vulnerability Is this life?
When is it going to get better? I’ve been in the same situation for five years. It’s all the same How do I act nonchalant when I know everyone has a partner or a friend in their life, and I don’t have a single soul to talk to except ChatGPT
I would rather  not exist than live like this
