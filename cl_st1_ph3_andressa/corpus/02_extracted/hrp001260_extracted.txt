What's the point? 
It's going to be a long post. 

I (31f) am working in Bangalore, as Software Developer, earning is good. 
Belong to a middle class family. 

I feel I am done having this phase again and again. Sitting by myself and stressed badly about my future. 

I am trying to be better socially and friends? what's the point, they'll move on with their own life, marriage and kids. Here, I don't even know if I want to get married or not.
In times like these, I desparately desire for someone who'll make this phase disappear from my life forever, I know life is not meant to be easy but I'm a soft soul. I can't take this anymore. 
What do I even have to go through it like this. 

I am having a lot of social interactions, in fact I had an almost 5 hours call today with a friend today. Spent 1 2 days with my close friend thus Thursday, had a house party on 31st. Everything. But no constant, no one I can tease or just be with like a family. There's this one friend but he's only one and he has gotten a lot busier as he works for a start up now. 

When will I get peace in terms of social circle? when? I went for piano classes today, came then went for shopping with 4 people who I know little bit. Like mentioned earlier had a 5 hours call. 

Am I just an overthinker? so my brain is doing me bad? 

All my passion and ambitions everything, my personality everything is consumed by the anticipatory anxiety of an empty life. 

I'm not at all strong enough to deal with it. I'm frustrated that I'm doing nothing towards my goals, I'm useless.
