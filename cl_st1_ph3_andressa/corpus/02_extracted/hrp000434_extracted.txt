I've never been so lonely in my life... I laugh it off but things that are in my head that i want to happen never happen. I'm a junior in highschool and i feel like such a outliar. Ive been single for 3 years and I still can remember her perfume and how she always grabbed my hand when she was nervous. I'm 17, turning 18 and i just want one thing in life that i know will never happen to me. Nothing suppresses my feelings, Sure, videogames help but there only a temporary distraction to what's really happening in my life i always feel so lonely and seeing couples in the halls or out and about makes me feel even more lonely and day by day nothing is helping...
