I just can’t believe I’m still by myself. I was with someone last year and he suddenly disappeared around December . Can’t reach him by phone. I even sent him a bday present acting like everything was ok. Still nothing. This is someone who said he wanted to marry me. He had his own demons tho. Alcohol and needing therapy 

I always have this thought in my mind that I did all I could. Every time something ends…I just know my heart and intentions are always pure and they will never know a genuine person that can offer love like me. I just feel like they notice too late. Because somewhere down the line someone from my past attempts to reach out again 😭
