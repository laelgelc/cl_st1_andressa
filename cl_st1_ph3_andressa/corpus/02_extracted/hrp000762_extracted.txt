 Normally I keep this to myself but I’m going to vent it to some strangers on the internet.

 Every single day I do my best for my parents, extended family, and my career. I take care of a great deal of the burden of others because I have to, that’s fine though as I don’t have a problem with it. The problem I do have is that I’m on the bad side of my 30’s without my own house or children while with a woman I’ve been with for 2 years that wants those things. I’m stuck or at least I feel it. 

 Anytime I show weakness to anyone else they tell me that they are the problem. That they are why I’m miserable. So I’ve started to just become accustomed to bottling it up without actually being able to talk to anyone about my “burn out”

I am alone, thanks for reading. Hope you have a productive day.
