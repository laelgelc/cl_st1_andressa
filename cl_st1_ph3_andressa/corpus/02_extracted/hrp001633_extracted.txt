Hi guys, 
I need to take things off my chest, I don’t have that many people to talk to as it feels very humiliating to me. I moved 2 years ago from Switzerland to London to study. It has been a huge struggle for me to make friends, I have 2 good friends but it doesn’t hit home like my friends back in my home country. 
My housemates and I are throwing a Halloween party tonight and each invited around 20 people. I invited 10, with some where I hoped I could get to know them better through this event. 
Several have cancelled throughout this week which made me sad but it is halloweekend so expected it. What I was not expecting was my closest friends cancelling last minute, with one saying she’s going to another party and the 3 others ( they’re all best friends) cancelling all together. 

I feel deeply hurt as I find this so humiliating that I have no one except my brother that are coming. I try my best to be a good friend but I can’t help but feel like I’m not worthy enough and that’s why they all cancelled. 
I struggled with making friends all my life and I used to be bullied as a teen leading to anxiety now. 

I am still looking forward to meeting my housemates friends but I usually feel more confident to talk to them if I have a friend by my side, but now that I’m left all alone I’m terrified. 

 I guess I just want to know if someone relates or has any tips? 
Thanks
