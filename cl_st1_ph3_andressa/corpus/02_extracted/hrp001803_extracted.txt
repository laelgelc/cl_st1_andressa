First off I’ve always been anti social even as a child. Could come from being picked last or being shut down when I needed attention but either way decades of this lifestyle. 
Now I’m almost 30 and I’ve been single 6 years. No pets and my job is very isolating but I found small ways to interact. Now I’m up for a promotion that will completely isolate me and the rest of my life is already alone. I need the money it’ll be great but idk how I’m gonna manage the crying on the way into work and when I leave because I literally don’t have any human interaction. Friends all got married or had kids or grew apart. I’m petrified to go out and socialize same pattern. My body has never been worthy of any kind of relationship or being in public. 
I know I’m a damn mess.
