I have dogs, but I also have a family. If I was to live alone I probably wouldn't be a dog owner simply because of the social aspects of being a dog owner, their codependency, and "dog" people. I like loner cats but indoor cats bum me TF out, and I don't want to become schizophrenic! lol Any theories for ultimate low key loner pet?
