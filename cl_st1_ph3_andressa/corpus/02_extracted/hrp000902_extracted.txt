Okay so first; my English is not so good, it’s not my first language.

So HEY! My name is Linus (25M) and I am a very shy person and I have a stutter so it’s hard to make friends or even have a girlfriend, so my life is not so great I am a patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and since I got that diagnosis I closed up completely I thought I was the only one who had that.

So I life in Belgium, I work in a nursing home I talk with everyone there but it’s a different talking voice, but once I am done I am alone. After my work I go sometimes to the gym or I read books or play video games, it’s hard to make friends outside and in my head so I hope that’s gonna change sometimes I really hope so.

So thanks for looking at my post.
