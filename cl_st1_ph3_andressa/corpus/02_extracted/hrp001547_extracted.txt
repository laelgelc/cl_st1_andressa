Hello Redditors in this Sub, i am so tired of this loneliness and my boring lifestyle. I feel like stuck in a continuous loop, doing the same thing for every single day. I can't cope up with this social anxiety and loneliness anymore, i am insecure about my looks and have a very mid personality that's the reason i became an average girl in my life. No friends no real or social connections, could neither build a relationship or atleast a genuine friendship with anyone. Sometimes i feel like i wasted my peak teenage years staying home and doing absolutely nothing. Now i see people younger and older than me are enjoying their life while me i am questioning my existence here.
