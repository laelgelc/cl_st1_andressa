Trying to find a way to be more social without actually leaving my house. I'm not afraid of society or anything, but being around large groups gets really frustrating really fast. So as many have done, here I am on reddit to seek interaction. So I just want to say hello and I hope everyone is having a great day and not being giant pieces of shit like most of the people I have to interact with for my job. 🙂 feel free to rant about how your day has gone so far, good or bad.
