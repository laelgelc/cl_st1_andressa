I tend to do pretty well navigating the loneliness in my life, socializing as I can, but birthdays are always really rough. Today’s my 27th birthday and the 3rd year in a row that I’ve spent it entirely alone. I’m still doing my best to enjoy it, getting my favorite burger for dinner and playing some skeeball, but any tips on adding a little joy to a lonely birthday would really be appreciated. Thanks my other lonely peeps
