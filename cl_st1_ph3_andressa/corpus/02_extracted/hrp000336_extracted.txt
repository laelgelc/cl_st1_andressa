I’m 31 years old. A bartender, a failed tattoo artist. I have two cats, and that’s basically it.

I have a huge family. All those grandmothers, great-grandmothers, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters. You wouldn’t fit them all into one restaurant. But I don’t communicate with any of them. My mother doesn’t love me — she actually hates me. My father ignored her insults and abuse. And my brothers… they always treated me with disrespect and contempt, because in our family hating and disrespecting someone is considered “normal.”

In 2018, unable to take it anymore, I left home. I was 23. I regret not leaving earlier. And this whole huge family didn’t look for me — nobody cared. No one tried to find me.

I have friends, but everyone has their own life. My closest friend has a husband and a daughter. We’ve been friends for 25 years, and it feels like we no longer have much to talk about. I know she loves me, but our paths are slowly drifting apart. I don’t blame her for it — that’s normal. I just miss her sometimes.

I have friends, Artur and Alexey. Both are married, and although I know their wives and we get along well, I can’t be hanging out with them all the time — for obvious reasons.

And so here I am: surrounded by crowds of people, not an orphan, fairly attractive and cheerful — yet painfully lonely. I wish I had someone I could call sometimes. Ask how their day went. Talk about our coworkers. Feel supported. Feel that I matter to someone. Find my person.

I’ve tried before, mostly Tinder. But it rarely goes beyond chatting. All those Tinder interactions feel like the same boring job interviews. Even when I try to show initiative and creativity, people there seem so passive.

And sometimes I think: what the hell am I doing wrong?!

My therapist says I’m in a borderline state right now — I no longer allow people to treat me badly, but I still don’t understand how to accept care from others, even though I desperately need it.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Probably just waiting for a miracle.
