Does anyone deal with loneliness by excessively daydreaming? I’m not even sure if daydreaming is the right word. I guess I mean make up a whole different reality. It’s starting to worry me how much I do this. A quick google search and apparently it’s normal for people suffering from loneliness or depression. When I am eventually around people or if my mind is busy with work I don’t don’t do this, but the rest of the time it’s all I do to get by.
