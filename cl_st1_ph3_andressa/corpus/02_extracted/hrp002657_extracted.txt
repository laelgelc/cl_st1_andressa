I dont't have any real friends and the people I eat lunch with, I don't like them. The only reason why I sit with them is because I have no one else and I don't want to sit alone. I walk through the halls with my head down and I radiate sadness. I was very cringy and embarrasing in middle school and a lot of the girls now think I am weird in my grade. Every crush I had, I have felt rejection and really want once to date someone. I hear all the time about people talking about how they have had sex or done drugs. While these are not the things I want to experience excluding sex, I feel alone. I know how to drive but have no car. I don't have a job and I don't play any sports. Every time, I am in class, I hate when the teacher calls on me and I feel attention.  thank you for reading, if you have any advice, please let me know
