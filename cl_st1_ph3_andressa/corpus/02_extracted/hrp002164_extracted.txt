male, dont feel comfortable saying my age.

I made another post under this a few weeks (or days.) ago.

Moving on from that, I still feel miserable. I used to be the type of kid to joke around, and be a unserious person, but a year ago I started to shift into a more mature side, I wanted to be quiet, get my mind straight, and workout. Fast forward, im in a terrible time. I don’t feel motivated anymore, people at my school make fun of me a lot, I try to be more distanced from them but it doesn’t seem to work, whenever they come up to me I mostly get a response with, "What’s up with you?" Or, "Why do you look like that? Stop acting sad." And I gave up explaining, because I know people don’t take me serious, even my parents. All I do is shrug, or respond with, "just chilling." That’s it, I don’t want any validation from people (especially my friends.) who still look at me the same, all im really doing is putting up an act and still joke around, I force myself to and it’s exhausting.

All I do now is just try to be quiet, but every single time it’s always someone coming up to me, and it’s mostly females.
