I’m a 32 year old loner artist. I work a normal 9-5 and on the weekends I enjoy smoking weed or taking shrooms and vibing out to some good music while I paint or draw. Sometimes I like to sit in silence meditate or create music. I sing compose on the piano and I make r&b/ soul music on logic. I mostly like experimenting with my consciousness and learning more about the metaphysical. I’m a loner artist nerd who needs reset time lol what are you’re interests? What do you like doing in your solitude?
