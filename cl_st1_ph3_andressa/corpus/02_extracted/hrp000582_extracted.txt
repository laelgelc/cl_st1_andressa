Throw away because my main is my name. I (24M) have been feeling really down lately. Idk if it’s seasonal depression or what but it’s been weeks. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I’m tired all day and I really hate that. Lately I was told a family member is dying and that’s got me down. I moved to a new area earlier this year and don’t have friends or family near. The friends I do have are mostly online. Lately they have been ignoring me. I had texted one of them, a close in person friend who I play video games with but I was ignored. I texted again and was ignored again. He’s made some new friends online and I’m happy for him but I didn’t expect to get dropped. We’ve been friends for years and for the life of me I cant think of a reason he’d be upset with me. I’ve tried talking to him but don’t get an answer. Our other friends (online) have also been ignoring me and I have no idea why. I feel alone.

TLDR: Family member dying, friends ignoring me. Any advice would be awesome
