I'm a good man and a good partner.  I do everything for her and the kids. I am fit, I get compliments from women, I dont think outwardly im ugly. But fuck do I feel ugly. I feel like I dont exist, im just here to pay the bills and take care of everyone. I know she loves me, but she doesnt want me. I miss being hugged when I come home, I miss the hands on affection.  I am alone in my home that is full of people that love me.
