One thing i realised I'm 22 YO turning 23 this year life's been on a loop every valentine I see couples old one's and new one's celebrating and living some good moments together and here I'm life slipped by with all the academic pressure and I want to a millionaire dream and still at zero .I always thought yes there's time I'll be able to enjoy all those things having a crush, falling in love, cafe hoping, making weekend plans, Watching a beautiful sunset together while holding hands, lying on my girls lap while i watch her play with my hair lol I sound desperate now ngl. All I want to say is how I wanted to be different stole many such moments ik it sounds so creepy and desperate no matter how I cool I sound "bro i don't want a gf they're waste of time i don't want to be in a relationship" but yeah i want to be in one and I want to live those moments, this loneliness and solitude is really tough it's better when someone is by your side where you can be you no judgement no pretending just real you. After seeing the dating scene on dating apps i don't think there's any chance I would find anyone. Well haha ig i should sleep now
