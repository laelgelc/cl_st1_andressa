Today I read a post that really impacted me. I thought it was true about a person who needed company, someone to take care of him, and someone to take care of this person. Then it turned out it was all a scam. I don't know if it's appropriate to post this here, but I don't know. Maybe there is someone here who is going through a bad time and needs these things. I only offer my support and my company. The only request I ask of you is that you please look at my profile before writing to me.
I should edit the post a little because the important part that I forgot to say, the one that impacted me the most is that this person said that he was seriously ill and was only twenty years old, he played with other people's feelings.
