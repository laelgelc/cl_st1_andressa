My birthday was a couple days ago, and honestly I feel a little forgotten honestly, I have a decent sized family so I thought maybe they’d remember or get me something, not even that the gifts would matter, just, wanted someone to actually message me other than my own mother, best friend, and partner, my best friend was the one to call me at midnight a few minutes after my birthday, everyone else just posted on my Facebook was the regular Happy birthday I don’t know if that helps, but it kind of sucked, I guess that’s how adult birthdays are, I’m not sure, just how I was told they’d be, it just wasn’t how I expected it I guess, am I being selfish for feeling this way, am I wrong for feeling bad about being more or less forgotten, I didn’t even get a message from many maybe just my moms friend, my immediate family like my mom and sister, but other than that, they just posted in my Facebook.
