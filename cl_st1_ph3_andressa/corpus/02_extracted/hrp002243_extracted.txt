I retired at 35. Medically from the military. All of a sudden I had no friends. No family. No social life. No job. No way to get about. Just my wife and I, her family (they’re great but I’m not close with them), and our two dogs. Now, a few years later nothing has changed. My wife has found a few friends, a niche maybe in the community. She’s close with her sister. But for me, I’m still here, by myself. Broken and alone. Watching the world go by without me. I don’t even want friends anymore, community. Why bother.
