It’s been hard being respected and taken seriously enough. Nobody at my job respects me because of the way I sound and the way I look. The way my voice projects, the way my face looks, how I talk, how I walk, etc. 

Even in relationships I’ve been neglected, cheated on several times in two different relationships out of the three I’ve been in, left behind, abandoned to where I had to walk 30 miles back home because my first ex abandoned me at the mall (I was looking for an engagement ring) and I didn’t have a car at the time. I’ve even been told that the only reason any girl would ever love me is if they’re desperate and I’m the only option left. 

I’m not a people pleaser but I also give up on everyone. There’s a reason I hate people so much. They suck so bad
