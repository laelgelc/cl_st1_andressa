"Never was I less alone than when I was alone."

That quote strikes me hard. I'm married but feel no connection with my wife. There's a lot to unpack there.

I have two boys ages 2 and 5 but they are autistic. My 5 year old can talk, but really can't hold a conversation. I think my 2 yo is on the same track. Maybe someday I'll have a real discussion with one or both of them. Maybe.

No real friends. One guy from high school I see occasionally for dinner, but that's it. 

I WFH so no chance for office chit-chat.

Reddit is pretty much my social life. How pathetic is that?

At least I have that quote - loneliness isn't about having a body next to you. You can be in the presence of others and feel totally alone.
