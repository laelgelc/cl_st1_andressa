As the title says, I’m just incredibly tired of being single. I’m a 26-year-old guy from the UK (nearly 27 now), and I’ve still never had an actual, in-person relationship. I’ve tried dating apps, but with very little luck, and honestly I just don’t know what to do anymore.
How does anyone actually meet people? Especially people with shared hobbies, like gaming or similar interests. I don’t know… I’m just so tired of not having love in my life. I don’t want to keep living like this.
I don’t think I’m particularly bad-looking — I’m just a little shy. I don’t know. I’m just exhausted from having to endure these lonely feelings every day at this point, and I really wish I knew what to do.
