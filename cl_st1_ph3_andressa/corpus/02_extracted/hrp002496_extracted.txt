I’m 31 and I’ve never been in a relationship.
When I was in school, my friends had boyfriends and got attention. I didn’t. I always felt left out, and over time that turned into believing I’m unattractive or unlovable.
Even now, those thoughts come back—like I don’t have the kind of personality people fall for. I keep asking myself if anyone will ever love me the way I want.
I just wanted to share this and see if anyone else feels the same, or if it ever changed for you.
