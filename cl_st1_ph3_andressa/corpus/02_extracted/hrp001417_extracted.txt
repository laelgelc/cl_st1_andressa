I sometimes post and read other posts as well, I get to interact and talk a lil bit but then they ghost me. I think no matter how hard I try this never ending loneliness will never leave me. Maybe I shouldn't feel bad about it. If it's going to last long then I should probably make the best out of it. I try to get back to my hobbies and create new habits but they don't seem to work out because of my health, but once I fix it, I think I'll be alright. Ngl, it hurts when I see people having beautiful interactions and me always observing but never able to become part of it, perhaps it's better for me to give up on that thing and make peace with loneliness. This will be my last post here, I'll control my urges to never post and even think of loneliness again.
