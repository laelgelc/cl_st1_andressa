never had a good connection with anyone. mostly lonely in childhood, as a teen and now as a 20yo college student. can't find anyone to rely on, can find anyone who doesn't judges me, can't find anyone who barely even likes me. i don't think anyone even wants me them. whoever i am finding is just trying to use me. i'm not able to share anything to anyone, just keeping it inside and dying. i thought friends meant something. turned out no one is friend, just some connections. it is me who is stupid, thinking that yeah i value this person, so they also value me. i care too much. fml
