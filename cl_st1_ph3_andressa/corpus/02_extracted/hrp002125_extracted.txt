I'm started getting tired to induldge my mom's ignorant treatment toward me like i am delusional who enjoy being labeled as "depressed person".

 When in reality, i felt so empty and tired to play along the game of "acting like everything is fine amd shit can be treated by mama's silly  tape-on project that she wanna show her daughter like a proud girl and when to get a compliment". 

I felt shitty at work from people and stress that i want it to just put me down like a dog. 

I'm depressed at hell how i was insulted at work and have to put on poker face to pretend that all is fine, i enjoy being doormat.

I fucking tired now....
