Hello IAM 20M who is been through not so great life. I think the reason for my loneliness for is my childhood during my childhood I had not many friends whoever I had friendship with either used for their own gain or just wanted to bully. At 17 I tried to ask my best friend to be my girlfriend and she said I was too ugly and broke for her which broke my heart. After turning 18 I left my hometown and went far away from there. I have changed a lot in 2 years I used to be attention seekers now I don't socialise anymore. I think if try to gain friendship or relationship it's gonna end like old times so I gave up on social life and all alone. Sorry for the venting.
