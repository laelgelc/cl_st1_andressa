I don’t really know how to write this without sounding strange, but I’ve been sitting with it for a long time.

I’m one of those people who looks “fine” on the outside. I work. I function. I talk to people. But inside I feel like I’m always braced for something bad to happen. Like my body never actually relaxes.

I’ve had addictions in the past, but even when I stopped using, the feeling didn’t go away. The tight chest. The restless brain. The constant need to distract myself. It took me years to realise I wasn’t craving substances – I was craving safety. I was craving being held in some invisible way.

I started learning about how the nervous system works, trauma, attachment, and why some of us never feel settled no matter how “good” life looks. A lot of us didn’t get calm, attuned connection when we were young, so our bodies stay in survival mode forever.

That’s what loneliness really feels like for me. Not being alone, but not feeling safe inside myself or with anyone else.

I ended up building something for myself because I couldn’t find anything that actually helped. It’s a small nervous-system reset thing. No therapy talk, no motivation, just something to help your body come out of that constant alarm state.

I’m not trying to sell anything here. I just know there are other people on this sub who feel the same way and don’t have words for it.

If not, that’s okay too. I just needed to finally say this out loud.
