Apologies, grammar is not my strong suit 

How do i convey it into words, maybe there are no words, just the thoughts of a lonely mans mind pouring out..
Is it a breaking point or shut down… been Slowly shutting down for a while, if im being honest. A life spent  trying to help people by always being the ear to listen ,  or the emotional sponge trying to suck up any negativity in the room, doing good deeds and offering everything and anything if it will help someone in need. Then life throws you a curveball and you find yourself completely restarting and rebuilding your life at 40 year mark, and you go into what people call protecting your peace mode that has become total isolation, you reach out to people you feel close to but the phone hasn't rung in two months, only tex messages and one word answers, and you find yourself going literal days or weeks without actual verbally communicating with people. I hate the feeling like your forcing conversation out of someone, and then the  slow relations that the only people you feel close with may not even really consider you a close friend or a friend at all.. when does it become to much? How long can a person hold a smile for? 25 years is a long time to hold it together to make sure other people smile. Although im happy to, a simple smile can be a powerful thing. 
I've always been a loner, but there are days that are lonely and other days that show you just how alone you really are..
