Hi. i'm a 19 year old furry.

That sentiment may or may not hold importance to what I have to say, but I digress.

Furries have a bit of a reputation amongst others. If they're not drop-dead gorgeous, they have these fantastical jobs that kids can only dream of.

I was scrolling on Tiktok about 2 nights ago, which was probably a terrible idea.

I stumbled upon this rather wholesome videos. It was about a fellow furry, who happened to be a racecar driver.

That was fine. They were much older than me, and it didn't really phase me. In fact, since youth, I always wanted to be a racecar driver. My entire life essentially revolved around racing.

I made the mistake of opening the comments, and discovering other racer furries, some as young as 15, racing in regional events.

I'm 19, and I have never set foot in a racecar ever, let alone had the money to do so. Especially that 15-16 individual really hit me hard. It made me realize that I haven't done as much as I wanted to have done in my life so far, as the window to start racing is most likely far gone for me.

It's gotten so bad that I've flatout considered abandoning my love for cars, and I haven't left my room since Friday night essentially.

Even thinking about cars makes me sad now, realizing that accomplishing my dreams is most likely done for. I completely forgot about said dream until that night, and now I can't stop thinking about how I could've done something in life. But instead, I've done nothing more significant than rot in my own bed.

Not only that, I am very unattractive and unhealthy. Even if I did have the money for racing, I'd be at such a big disadvantage.

I wish I could've done just something.

God DAMNIT.
