Does anyone have any advice? I go on social media sites and enter chat rooms to talk to people. It's a Christian server, and I've been there for about a month, but even after frequent messaging and speaking, my messages seem to be cordially ignored in favour of someone else's. It goes like:

me: Hi, I just bought something I thought was cool!

\*someone else joins\*: I just went to the mall!

Person 1: OH MY GOSH, WHAT DID YOU BUY?

might be looking into it too deeply since social media is my only outlet for social interaction.
