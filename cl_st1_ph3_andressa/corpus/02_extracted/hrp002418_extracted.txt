It's just such a common thing I've heard. That lonely people deserve it and that if they just worked on themselves then they could just be happy. They speak like good things naturally come to good people and bad things happen to bad people. They'll acknowledge that abusers exist and have no issue going through people like a scythe does to wheat and shed many a tear for their victims but never acknowledge the lonely saints in the world. If they suffer in isolation then they must have done something.  
I remember an online friend telling me they thought that all lonely men were just bastards who deserved it. They seemed to forget that I had no in person friends and upon remembering told me that I was the good one, that my isolation was just bad luck but everyone else in a similar position was the gears of karma and should not be offered empathy.  
  
People always talk as if I and every other lonely person deserves it. Never to our faces, only in the abstract. If only we cut out this unnamed and unknown sin entirely in the dark and on our own then maybe we could end up with friends like all decent people do.  
I wonder why? I guess it's just easier to sweep injustice into a box named karma than to have a messy view of the world with all its painful nuance.
