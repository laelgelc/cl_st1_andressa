I turn 25 today 
Like most birthdays I’m spending this one alone again 
Surrounded by people but no one really ever remembers
 I’ll get a few happy birthday texts maybe a emoji if I’m lucky 
I tell myself it’s the holidays, parts of me get used to people overlooking it 
But I’ll never get used to the feeling of it 
Such a sad thing to feel forgotten on your birthday 
The feeling of unimportantance swallows me whole 
I can feel the weight of my emotions as they push my body closer to the ground 
That sinking feeling you feel as off your heart is dropping to the ground is one all to familiar for me 
Ever since I was young all I wanted was to see people excited to celebrate me 
It’s so hard to feel excited for something that im supposed to be excited for when the people your close with are excited for you put little no effort to make any of that happen 

Every year I look forward to my birthday thinking this year will be better 
But it seems the older I get 
The more invisible I seem to become 
Is who I am not worth celebrating I often think to myself 
As I see everyone else get celebrated and planned for 
but when it’s my turn 
I often wonder is it just unfortunate timing 
Or if I’m just not worth the hassle 
If people cared enough surely they’d Inconvenience themselves a little for someone important to them right? 

If they wanted to they would 
I tell myself 

I find it inauthentic to ask to be celebrated 
When someone is meaningful enough people show up for them 

I yearn for someone to care enough to ask me if I wanted to do something for my birthday just one person 
To show some interest in me 

All I’ve ever wanted was a surprise party as silly as it sounds 

 I just want is to feel remembered for my birthday 
I want to feel like people care 
I just want to feel special just for a day 

Every year always leaves me with the same feelings of disappointment 

People care but not enough.
