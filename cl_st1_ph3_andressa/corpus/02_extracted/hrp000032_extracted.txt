 

in 2019 my place of work announced they were closing the place where i am employed. i been looking for new work ever since. cant find shit. had ANOTHr interview last monday. and Got a rejection email late last night. its my 10th interview. 10th rejection. out of nearly 300 applications. i expect the last of us will be let go b the end of this year so my time is almost up

i bought 3 bottles of liquor dont know why. just dcrank one and a half of them. so yea im drunk as the fukin worthless fuck i am

i think im broken. there must be something wrong with me. otherwise i would be abl to find work wouldnt i?

feeling drunk is the best ive felt since i found out im losing my job. ii dont wanna have to sober up.

i hate my llife, i hate myself. i hate waking up in the morning because it means i dint die in my sleep.

i still have 1 and a half bottles left. i honesly dont know if ill be able to stop myself from just drinking it all tonight and im not sure i care if i can or not
