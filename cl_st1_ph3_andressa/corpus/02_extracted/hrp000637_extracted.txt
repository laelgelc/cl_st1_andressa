Sooo, kind if a weird situation today.
Long story short, I dont really have "friends" friends. I have one friend who I go out with a few times a year. 2 weeks ago we went out to celebrate my birthday. We had a great time. But he is an extrovert who has a lot of friends and I am not really that special to him. Just anorher guy he knows and has fun with every once in a while. So today I decided I would go out alone. I am sick of wasting my youth on nothing and if it means I have to go out alone then thats it. So I did. But it was kinda lame. Just came back from a party that I went to alone. I know its my fault that I didnt really do nothing there except look at my phone because I felt akward. And the party was kinda lame this time but I dont want to try to find excuses. But still, I keep wondering what should I do ? Just accept the fact that thats it ? I am a bit drunk so sorry if this all sounds weird. 

My question is:

Has anyone been in a simular situation and how did you get out of it ?
