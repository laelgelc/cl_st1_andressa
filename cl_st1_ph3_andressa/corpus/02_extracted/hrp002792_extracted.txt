Over summer I really got into kayak fishing. I loved spending the day out in the water alone getting high and fishing. Now summer is over I'm kind of at a loss as what to get into on my weekends. I have a hike planned for late winter once avalanche season is over but my weekends have become pretty boring with the bad/cold weather.
