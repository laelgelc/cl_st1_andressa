It’s the first year in a while that I actually want to do something to celebrate after a couple of years grieving the loss of a parent, etc. (Other tough life stuff).   
I’m no stranger to taking myself out to places or doing things alone - I’d rather be alone in my own company than around a person or people who make me uncomfortable, feel misunderstood, or whatever. And while I do enjoy my own company, there are factors that make being out and about surrounded by loud people who are always with at least one other person, make the environment almost intolerable to me. It’s just not very enjoyable in the long run/satisfying. So I’ll leave and feel it was more of a waste of my money and time.

 And while I have platonic mostly online acquaintances/they’re guys who followed me off of dating apps when I was briefly on them and I have no desire for that kind of friendship/weird dynamic which I’ve done enough of in my 20s.   


I was thinking of going to a ski resort for a day or of treating myself to a spa day. I have some side job work and studying to do otherwise.
