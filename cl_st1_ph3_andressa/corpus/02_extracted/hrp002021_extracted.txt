Hi everyone I wasn't sure where to turn. I feel very alone in trying to find a group I can get some guidance from about this issue. A loved one of mine is suffering from AI addiction. I'm not sure how to have conversations with this loved one and I want to be with others who are in a similar situation as me. It just feels isolating and I'm really trying my best to help this loved one. If anyone could direct me to a subreddit or any other resources I'd really appreciate. Thank you.
