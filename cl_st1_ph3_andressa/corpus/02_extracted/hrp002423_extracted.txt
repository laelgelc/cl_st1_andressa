I'm a very lonely person. And in my solitude recently, I've been thinking about how terrible it feels to be nobody's number one. And for that matter, not really on anybody's list at all.

I've done all the trying, and reaching out, and inviting, and being the first to…...

With simply no reciprocation. I see that everyone else has a group. I see that everyone else has an adventure planed together. I see that everyone else has their inside jokes and knowledge. And when I'm around groups of people, I realize just how left out and alone I've been which makes me feel even more socially awkward because there's no place for me.

Why am I always on the outskirts?

Why am I the one people don't think to invite?

Why have I been forced to learn how to be a loner and look like I'm having so much fun doing everything and going everywhere alone?

Why am I nobody's close friend?

Why am I the last to find out anything about the people I thought I was growing relationships with?

I can't figure out what my issue is that I'm so dislikable and unsuitable for friendships. I'm so willing to change or grow or develop whatever aspect it is of myself that people find so abhorrent, but I don't know what that is.
