I haven’t ever been wanted. Really wanted I mean. I’m there, I can fill a space. But there is always someone or something that can replace me. I hate being something that can be replaced or not even acknowledged in the first place. I get that my friends are genuine and they care about me, but not enough to talk to me regularly. Expect for one but he’s got a partner and a kid so I barely see him. 

As for romantic stuff, I’ve never been a consideration. I don’t blame anyone for that, it just doesn’t make me feel good seeing everyone else being happy or at least being wanted, and I’m never anyone’s type. I don’t believe in the incel shit fyi, I think it’s silly. But still, I do wish I could feel like I’m worth loving, even if it’s only once.
