19M, 2 years post graduation. Still a virgin. I can count on one hand the times I’ve ever kissed a girl. Only ever had one relationship in my entire life, ended horribly, got completely walked out on and treated like shit.  Mid looking as fuck but have higher standards I can’t help. The longer I wait, the smaller the pool shrinks. Fuck this shit. I’m so miserable. I just want somebody to love me. No one has ever said I love you to me ever. I’ll die alone
