It's like they make it the reason for everything. They make it the reason for my panic attacks, for my anxieties, for absolutely everything but when they treat me this way it makes me feel way more alone. It's like they're doing things right when I am not. I know they don't come from a place from malice but at the same time they're making the feeling worse. This is a simplification of everything but I just don't feel like writing something too long.
