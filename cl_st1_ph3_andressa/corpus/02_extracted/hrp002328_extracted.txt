18f Hiii, I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been shy my whole life, but lately it’s gotten out of hand. I used to have a close friend group from childhood and we’d have hangouts, calls all the time. But they changed, got into bad influences, and things got messy. It became constant stress and I was always trying to stop something, so I eventually distanced myself and cut them off. They also had a lot of guys around. I didn’t mind, but I prefer keeping my distance from guys, and a few didn’t respect that boundary, which made me really uncomfortable. After cutting them off I honestly felt way better and less stressed, but I’ve also been alone for a while now and the loneliness gets to me. I have some mutuals I’m comfortable with, but we’re not close. I miss my old friends sometimes, even though I remind myself why I left. Recently I’ve tried being more social and meeting people, and some are genuinely really sweet, but my shyness makes me seem uninterested. I barely make eye contact, barely talk, I overthink a lot, and I end up avoiding attention even when I don’t mean to. If you read until here, thank you sooo much. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time
