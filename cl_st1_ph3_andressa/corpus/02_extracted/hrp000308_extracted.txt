Hi, I'm 27M and im in a group chat with two of my friends and I'd like to leave it because they never reply to my messages. For example, I asked them if they could meet up today and neither of them responded. Furthermore, when I send them reels or ask for advice on something, they almost never respond. The problem is that if I leave the group chat, they'll definitely write to me, "why did you leave the chat?" and similar things. I feel so lonely. I would send you the screenshot of my chat. There are only my messages. It's like I'm in a chat with myself. What should I do?
