Hi everyone, this is a depressing post but I needed to vent. My first kiss was five years ago (I was very intoxicated and kissed three people that night) but I haven’t kissed or had any affection since. I have been through college and been on dates, but there seemed to be no interest on anyone’s part. I feel awkward as if I cannot initiate it, especially since I felt so out of control the first time I did express affection. If you have any advice how to get over this pls let me know, idc if it is harsh or not, I probably need it.
