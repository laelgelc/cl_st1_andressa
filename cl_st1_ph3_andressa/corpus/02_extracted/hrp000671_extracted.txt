I just feel so empty lately. Life has been busy of course. Honestly who can't say the same right now, most days unsure if I'm coming or going. But right now I just feel like everything is hollow. The warmth gone. Like I'm just going through the motions. Faking everything from the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out in my bed. I know Im not alone of course. My family is all around me, but it feels as if they are not even there at all. Like they too are stuck in this feeling, going through the motions themselves.
My wife's touch doesn't feel the same, like it is an afterthought. I can see it in her eyes. She too is just tired and empty. Just going though the motions. 
Maybe I just need a friend? I haven't had a close friend in a few years. Not that there is time for friendship. Not when there are obligations to be upheld! My life is not my own. Our lives our not our own, dedicated to our children in the hopes that their childhood would be better than our own. Yet in the course of this pursuit I find myself crushing my own hopes, dreams, and happiness to dust.
At the end I just find myself sitting here, on the floor. Wondering why I just can't be happy. Why can't I just not feel so empty and alone? Why does the thought of being held right now in a hug, by almost anyone, makes me want to cry?
The kicker to all of that is that it makes me feel like a terrible person. That I need a hug so bad right now.
