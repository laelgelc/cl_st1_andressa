I've lived my young life more focused on my interests and schoolwork and whatever cable was giving on TV, I had crushes but I didn't do anything about them. I tried but never found a gf in my gap years neither. I had a date with a friend to senior prom, does that count?

It just feels hopeless for me, I know I'm not a social person and it makes sense for why it's so hard to find a mate. It hits me in the core when I see other people who are like me and they can find love, a shy girl or shy guy or whoever... If I can't find love in 2020, what crazy miracle would there be for us to find first love?
