To my brothers and sisters, to everyone that is losing their grip, to everyone that doesn't feel anything. I hear you, I see you. I know how you feel and what you're going through. So many times I've believed I've found the answers and so many times I've looked around and realized I'm just as lost as I've always been. So many times I've had to choose between life and feelings, I understand how it feels to lay back and let your mind and heart devour everything you love. 

I have experienced so many things in life and it's given me such a profound sense of understanding. I know that sometimes it doesn't matter to know that other people have been there and it even makes it worse sometimes. I'm not preaching and I'm definitely not saying I have all the answers. But I do have some. I understand the dull ache of pain that won't go away and I understand crying until you pass out from exhaustion. 

I guess what I'm saying is that I understand. I can't claim to know how to fix it but I do know how to survive. I've almost lost myself so many times but I want to use my pain to help people. It's hard to do this alone but believe me, you're never truly alone. If I can help anyone I'm definitely happy to. I love you all so much and your pain is my pain.
