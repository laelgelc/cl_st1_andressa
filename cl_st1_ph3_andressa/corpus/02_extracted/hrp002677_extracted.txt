I just realized that, for some time now, whenever I need someone to talk to, I talk to strangers on Reddit. I don't talk to my wife because there are just some things it's safer not to talk to my wife about and I don't talk to my friends because they're too busy or asshole-y to care.

I'm not asking for advice. Consider this an object lesson.
