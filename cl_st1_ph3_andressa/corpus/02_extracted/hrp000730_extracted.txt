2025 kicked my fucking ass and I hit rock bottom during spring. I was still struggling with a bad breakup that had happened a bit further back, my job was causing me regular mental breakdowns, my dog died, and I was constantly fighting with my parents.

I finally got a job in a new field that my best friend works in and also moved into an apartment with him and his girlfriend. In late 2024 we had all gone out with a group of their friends from work and stuff all the time. It was so much fun and I was looking forward to getting to know everybody more, especially because I'd be working with many of them. I was so excited to move and go out more, and also not be fighting with my parents anymore.

Now that we moved, I feel like we never hang out. For a while me, him, and his girlfriend would do a lot of stuff together and it was really fun. We still do sometime, but it feels like I never hang out with my friend without his girlfriend anymore. I had spoken to him about this and he understood what I meant, then we went out for a drink. After that it sorta went back to how it was before.

I've also stopped getting invited out with their friends. I was really looking forward to getting to know their friend group more, but I just feel completely excluded now that I've moved here with them.

They just feel like roommates now and not friends anymore. I've invited him out just to do random shit to hang out yet he's never free anymore. I just feel so alone and I really have no friends that live locally to hang out with. If I don't go running or to the gym after work then I just go home and chill alone and it's becoming harder and harder
