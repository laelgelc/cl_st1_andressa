24M/single/no kids. It's been 2.5 years since I've been in a serious relationship. I think I'm just having a wave of loneliness right now. Ever since I left my last relationship, I've learned to live life alone and enjoy things alone, not just "cope" alone. I was completely different person when I was with my ex. I can easily say that I've grown and healed a lot. I really have and believe that. But every now and then, I do still think about being wanted by someone. I'm not saying that I miss my ex, but one of the things that I remember is that I used to sleep so much better when we would fall asleep together. It felt nice, even safe emotionally when things were good between us.

Post breakup, I'll hook up with someone or have fling once or twice a year (my sex life sucks lol). I keep telling myself that some people like me are maybe not supposed to end up with someone. Despite having those quiet desires of being falling in love again. I guess I'm pretty comfortable being alone but sometimes loneliness likes to sneak up on me every now and then like tonight.

I'm also in that weird part of my life where all my friends are getting married and having kids. So, hanging out with old friends doesn't really feel that same.

To give some context of who I am and how my lifestyle is, I'm in the military and if I'm not a work, I'm at the gym working out. Outside of that, I feel like I'm pretty boring lol. It's pretty funny too because my friends keep asking me how I am still single because they think I'm a pretty decent good-looking guy.

I really don't know the intention of making this post, sorry to waste yall's time.
