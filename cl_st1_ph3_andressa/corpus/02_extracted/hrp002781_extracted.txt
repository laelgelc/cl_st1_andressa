I have be a loner for a long time, when I was younger I had a good friend. However, one day that friend decided to no longer be my friend. Apart from that one friend, I don't remember having many friends. Nowadays, I spend my time mostly alone; nevertheless I have tried to embrace the loneliness and accept myself for who I am.

Always remember that   **'You are a flower waiting to blossom'**   and that everyone is special in their own way.
