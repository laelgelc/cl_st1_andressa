I’m 40 years old. I’m a blind guy who also happens to be gay. I’m so insecure with my looks. I’ve been told I look ugly. I tell people on dating apps that I can’t see and they disappear. I’ve had other people tell me that I couldn’t appreciate their looks. It sucks. I just learned to be alone with my dog and cats. I think finding love is not possible.
