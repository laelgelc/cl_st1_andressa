I had a panic attack on the train today and a stranger helped me snap out of it. I’ve had panic attacks before but it’s never happened in public and this time it made me feel embarrassed that I couldn’t control myself and I couldn’t stop it. Once I got off the train I bought myself some water and tried to calm down and it still took me a long time to get back to normal. All this happened an hour before my interview and during my interview I could literally feel my voice dry up and stutter. I’m not sure what it is. I know it’s not the interview and I’m never stressed over performing in an interview it usually is one of my least worries. It was sure external factors but it made me feel so embarrassing while I couldn’t fetch a breath and my heart was racing and I felt like I was choking. Thank you for reading.
