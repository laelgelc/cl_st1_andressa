I'm really at my wits end here. For context I live in a small pseudo city and I'm a minority compared to the majority of people here so it hard to fit in and feel accepted. 

I know what I want but I don't know what to do... I really really want to live in the big city like New York or Chicago but luck has never been on my side. I have a 4 year degree and some certifications but the job market is devastating as of 2026 and it's really making me lose hope because I'm literally getting no job offers. Not a single one for months. I attempted to move to Boston with no job lined up, I did a leap of faith for a while trying to find jobs while I was there but ended up failing in the end and going back to my boring place with my parents.

I wish our government cared about us and gave us better infrastructure because I really do believe these suburbs and vehicular sprawl is doing a number on lonely people and their mental health. I was so much happier riding the train everyday in Boston and seeing faces outside where compared to where I'm at, I walk outside my place and not a single soul outside or children playing. 

I don't ask for much, a best irl friend or a relationship sounds nice but even just living around people and not being in the middle of nowhere would make me 10x happier. 

Currently just giving up and at this point just trying to pass the time smoking cannabis everyday
