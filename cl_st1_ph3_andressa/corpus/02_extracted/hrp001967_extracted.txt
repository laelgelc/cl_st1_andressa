Because most of the times I hear people say they have never had friends they’ve met at least one person online or someone in class or work but I’ve actually never had a single friend in my life at All.Only my family are in my phone contacts.Throughout elementary school,middle,school,and now being in my 3rd year of college I’ve never made a single friend.I also have never had a girlfriend or had sex. I’m so worried about my future as well since I will have to function by myself one day as an autistic person.
