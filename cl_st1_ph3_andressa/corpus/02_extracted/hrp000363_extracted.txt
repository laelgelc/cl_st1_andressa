My body and my heart aches looking at the profile I had once been friends with. You and I were inseparable we thought we had it all we were young and dumb. Between the animosity and piercing words, there were good memories. 

You were my first the one I thought was forever you broke me, causing years and years of help and aid to be put back together to be whole again to finally feel how I once had. 

I happened to come across your life online and you’re married. You finally get to start the life you once imagined with me. As happy as I am, I can’t help but feel that broken stabbing feeling in my heart as if the once broken part of me still remains within. 

although I am over you I can’t help but to feel a little bit of jealousy as once you looked at me and the way you look at her. Getting older and getting help help me realize I have found somebody that makes me feel the way you had once made me feel without the animosity and piercing words. 

It’s time I let go of my past and this is it all the feelings are out, I am finally at peace to say life is a journey and I’m only just beginning.
