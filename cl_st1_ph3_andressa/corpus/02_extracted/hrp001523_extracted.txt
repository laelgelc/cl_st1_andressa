Sometimes lonliness is created from your own victim attitude. It will never feel good to see yourself as punished or unfairly treated compared to others. It will not attract new friends or a partner. It will not give you energy. It will not give you an improved mood. It will not make a single positive difference or impact on your life. 

Some people assume if you're struggling with mental illness or physical injuries, you must pity yourself, and I'm here to let you all know  that's a myth. Self pity is seperate from disability, it's a character trait. Anyone can have it anyone can also not have it.
A billionaire can sit and feel sorry for himself when the 10k luxury dish wasn't good enough, while a homeless person walking the streets in a snow storm  is smiling cause someone let him pet their dog. The billionaire can have all he wants and still feels miserable because he has a victim mindset. The homeless person have very few things in life but he appreciate and embrace every minor detail. 

So. I wanna talk from the view of taking responsibility. Life is unfair. We all gotta work with what we got. If I'm unable to run, I walk to get where I want. If I'm unable to walk, I use crutches to get where I want. If I'm unable to stand, I use a wheelchair to get where I want. You get the picture. 

Lonliness feeds on people who pity themselves so if you do pity yourself, you're  welcoming more lonliness. 

With this said. Have a great weekend, treat yourself, be kind to yourself and dare to hold yourself accountable for your happiness,
