Im a teenager who used to have a good amount of friends, a trio, a childhood friend, and around 3-4 guys I was close to and would hangout out of school times. Lately I've lost almost all of these. The trio seems distant, the childhood friend chose someone else over me and most of the guys, hardly ever talk to them. It makes me feel quite alone honestly. These days I see a lot of people and their friendships and I am just lonely, I wanna be able to accept this but how? I want to know. I did try to salvage all of these but all of them hardly care about me so its not point they all have new friends whom they prioritize more and I am just kind of down about all this.
