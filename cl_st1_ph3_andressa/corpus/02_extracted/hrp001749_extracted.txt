I’m in my late 30s, happily married with kids. I used to have plans regularly with different friends and groups (with spouse) doing different things. Most the time I initiated the hangouts with friends. As of a few months ago, I have gotten off of social media entirely and it’s like everything has changed. I think I have hung out with friends 4 times in the last 6 months. And one of my friends treated me like trash. My spouse goes out regularly with friends and encourages me to do the same. I get a bit of a jealousy complex when they do because I’m not invited or don’t have any plans with any of my friends for the foreseeable future. 

My spouse makes friends just by looking at them. My sibling and their spouse have such a great friend group they are doing things with that group or certain friends of that group regularly and I get sad because I don’t have that and feel left out because I’m not invited. 

I went to a parent meet up and chatted with a parent and we swapped numbers. I texted the parent asking to get the kids together or go grab coffee and was ghosted. 

My spouse and I go out and do things frequently with either just the two of us or the kids too. I just feel like I have no friends and that gets lonely. 

I will text a few of my friends and just see what they are up to, sometimes vague responses or days go by without an answer. 

I just want a friend group or a friend who I could call randomly on a Saturday afternoon and meet for dinner that same day. Not wait a month to see the for an hour over dinner.
