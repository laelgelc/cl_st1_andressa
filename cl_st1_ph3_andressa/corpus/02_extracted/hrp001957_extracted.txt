Are you guys ever sad, just because? Sad because the few people that use to be are no longer there. Not because you don't talk to them, but because you're now 30 and everyone has a family, except you. I don't feel like I want a family,y maybe someone special but when everyone is busy with their family feels lonely because you can just go to someones house and enjoy time together.
