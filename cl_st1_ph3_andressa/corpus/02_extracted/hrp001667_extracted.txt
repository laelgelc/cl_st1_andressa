Hi. My boyfriend (23) is getting random but strong feelings of loneliness in the past few weeks. He lives alone and works the night shift. I live with roommates and study and have 2 works all in the morning and afternoon. I don't really have much free time and almost all of my free time is either for school or for being with him. Sometimes I stay 2 days in his house if I don't have classes on one of the mornings and sometimes he comes and stays at my place for a couple of days once a week.  We both work 6/7 days a week. He is starting to feel really lonely when he gets from work and has started to think about moving in together a lot. I (19) don't feel ready to move in with him any time soon, maybe after finishing college, or even after getting married. I think that we are in a good place on the relationship, we talk everyday and we continue to grow together as well as growing individually but it's been hard not having the same schedule. Because when I wake up he is just arriving from work and when I finish my day he is getting ready to leave. I want to help him feel better but I don't know how. Anyone has any advise/ideas?

Thank you
