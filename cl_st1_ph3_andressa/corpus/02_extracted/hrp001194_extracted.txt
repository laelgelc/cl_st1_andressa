Hello. I don't really post but I thought it would do me some good. Like many of you, I have have never been in a relationship and often spend my days all by myself at home in my tiny closet of an apartment or working nights, by myself. 

This year after working over 100 hours over the week of christmas and NYE(lots of overtime because nothing else to do) I decided to treat myself to a luxury all-inclusive resort in mexico.

I never been to one before and despite not having anyone to go with, I still went. I will admit that being the only person here who is not in a group or a couple is quite disheartening and there have been times where I really wish I wasnt so fucking lonely lol. 

However, overall I've had a great time by myself and had a really relaxing time reading my book on the beach and all the food and drinks is cool too. I got to see the mayan ruins and even had an entire pga golf course to myself!(I shanked all my balls into the lake though haha)

Anyways, I'm not sure what the point of this whole thing is but I didnt know any other community to share it with. I guess I'm saying to treat yourselves if you are able. It's surprisingly nice what it's like to feel like a normal human again!
