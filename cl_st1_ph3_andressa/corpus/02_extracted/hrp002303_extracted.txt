So i just lost my job. I’m typically a depressing guy, but after I told my roommate that I lost my job (again) I grabbed an energy drink and spent like HOURS, I’m talking HOURS, pacing back and forth, listening to music, imagining scenarios with friends I don’t have. That was the most joy I’ve experienced in a minute. How odd is it to feel socially fulfilled with people that aren’t there, conversations that didn’t happen, and places I never went and probably won’t.

Then I sat down cause my LEGS hurt (I’m gonna step on the scale to see if I lost a couple of lbs lol) and I was thinking of hitting the gym and doing all of these things I love that I don’t do when I’m depressed. I was thinking of bouncing back from my depression and imagining everyone’s reaction. Everyone that doesn’t exist. My friends don’t exist and now I’m less than as happy as I was before, and my motivation is gone. 

BONUS: Even if I was to MAKE the friends I fantasize about, history shows I’m usually disappointed hanging out IRL, since the conversations and happenings are a lot less interesting. Typically. Only good part I can see is that I’m told I should be an author or something.
