Even in a stadium filled with millions of people, it feels like not a single person is there to understand me. It's an endless search, trying to find that one person who will truly relate to me. I'm not even asking for ten people, not even a hundred. Just one person is all I'm asking for. Sometimes I want to yell as loud as I can just to see if anyone who shares the same experience as me will respond. But nobody responds. Nobody. Even around all of my friends and friends, nobody will understand. I'm going in circles right now. I want to find what I'm looking for, but how?
