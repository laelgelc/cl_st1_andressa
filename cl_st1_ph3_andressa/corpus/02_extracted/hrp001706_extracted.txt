(23) I have to quit the sport I’m in, going to the gym makes me cry from pain. Even bending my knees hurts like hell. All I feel is gut wrenching guilt and embarrassment from trying to hide my problems from my friends, it makes people uncomfortable when I talk about how bad it is for me- my age group doesn’t get it because they aren’t experiencing it. 

I can’t go to the doctor, I already have medical bills going to collections. I can’t afford my medications or therapies. I can’t even afford more than 1 ramen packet a day. It’s crushing to have to seclude myself from events and meals because I can’t afford them.

My mental health is taking a nosedive- I’ve always had problems with it but it’s also getting worse. They don’t feel this way, physically or mentally. They all get the good grades and can do daily activities with no problem, they don’t see what “the big deal is” or why simple chores are so exhausting.

It’s all just piling up, the bills, fatigue, hunger and pain.. I’m getting worse. Trying to keep up with them physically makes me feel like such a burden. Acting normal emotionally is exhausting. I can’t get too close to people, my discomfort rubs off on them- You can see the pity on their face, they know I’m not as well off as them. I want to look like an equal, not a wounded animal. When they know too much, I stop being treated like everyone else. They stop seeing me as “normal”.
