Got a horrible boring personality, ugly, dumb and im not rich. Tried making friends on here but they never stick around for long. The people that do, rarely reply and it feels like i have to basically beg them for attention or to stay. Got 0 friends that i talk to or hangout with irl and all my coworkers are older then me so we just dont really connect. I hate being me so much. Wish I could be someone else.
