and what do you do then ?

I feel like I have nobody to tell. I don't want to bother anybody with my feelings. Like, people have bigger problems etc and I wouldn't even know how to share, making people understand me has always felt like and unbearable difficulty. so anyway at the end of the day it's always just me crying at night and I'm tired. 

Who else is like this ?
