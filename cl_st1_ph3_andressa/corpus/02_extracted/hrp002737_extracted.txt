Hey. I dont have many friend because I cant create small talks. I will start the conversation only to people that im comfortable with. I rarely mix around and just talk to others if they approached me first. Sometimes I dont even understand myself. I know I have to make new friends but I just cant bring myself to talk to them first. Hence, I always feel like i have no one for me when Im sad.
