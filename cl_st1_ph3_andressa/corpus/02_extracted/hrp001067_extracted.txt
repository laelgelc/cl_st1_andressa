Loneliness sucks, but do y'all know what sucks more? Y'all giving up on yourselves due to loneliness. Let me be blunt here. Most of the time friendships suck. They're temporary and short. The reality is that nobody is going to be ever there for you if you aren't either mentally healthy, successful, stable or physically healthy. You don't need to be famous or wealthy in a typical sense. Most friendships stay due to stability and forced similar circumstances not because of loyalty, love, care or whatever else. Having a friendship isn't some magical thing. It's time consuming, dramatic, painful and there are too many expectations around friendships. 

Relationships are the same, but with a different flavour. Those convincing you that their friendships lasted for decades don't realise that their friendships lasted for decades because of forced similar cirumstances or stability. 

The best thing that all of you can do for yourselves is to value yourselves and have some self-respect. Loneliness stings, but it's not the end of the world. I'd say that being lonely is better than being surrounded by people anyway. Love doesn't exist and those are chemicals. Work on yourselves. Grind. Do the best for yourselves. Of course, don't become toxic or bitter. Value growth, knowledge and skills. If people come into your life, good, if they don't then fuck them.
