So, yeah, I have very low cortisol levels due to damage to my pituitary gland.  My thyroid is out of whack, testosterone levels messed up, now cortisol and adrenalin are found to be low.  

Low cortisol levels cause extreme fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain.

So I have finally, in my sixth decade of life finally built up the courage to go and try to do things, only to find that my body is actively working against me and the doctors are threatening more pills to add to my regiment.

I have also suffered from lifelong SzPd, anxiety, major depressive disorder, and PTSd secondary to assaults.  I have no spouse, no children, legal and medical problems have sucked me dry.  Just to add to the fun, this is the worst time of year for me and if I were a religious person I would pray to die in my sleep every single night cause I don't think I can take it anymore.
