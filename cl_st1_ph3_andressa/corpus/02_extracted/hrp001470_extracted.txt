About a year ago, I made friends with this girl, and I liked her, but she didn't like me back, but we managed to become very good friends. But over time we grew apart, and also she started dating other people, etc. Back home, I don't have many friends near me or a lot who I can do stuff with, and my parents love to keep pressuring me. So if you want someone to talk to, share day to day stuff...hola...
