I'm gonna be alone forever. I hate feeling this way. I keep thinking about being in a relationship throughout the day and then I cant do my work because I space out and get really sad. I just want someone to love me man. I recently downloaded some dating apps because I just turned 18 a month ago and I've gotten no matches whatsoever and it's really disheartening.
