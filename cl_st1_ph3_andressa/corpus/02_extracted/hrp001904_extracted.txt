This is a tough lesson i had to learn over and over again. Not every one of your “friends” is an actual friend.

Sometimes i overshare with the wrong person and end up regretting it. sometimes i allow disrespect because i don’t want to ruin a relationship. Sometimes I’m not appreciated enough. Sometimes people will only associate themselves with you as long as it benefits them, and immediately leave when it doesn’t.

I dont think ive had too many friends who actually cared about me.

I’ve done kind things and had patience with people that would never do the same back.

I keep relapsing on this mistake by being vulnerable and giving people a chance. Only to be let down again and again.

Not everyone is your friend.
