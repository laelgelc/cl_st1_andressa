I'm 26... Been 3 years since the last of my family has died... Didn't do anything worth a damn this year... Listened to Moe's birthday song, ya know "happy birthday to me"... I'm alive I guess but not living... Friends are all gone or dead, got no job, no hobbies... Lost those when I enlisted, kicked out for not having a next of kin... Accomplished my dreams, ha how many can Say that? 

*sigh* But I look back at it all... The wasted opportunities, how much I have been beaten down emotionally, spiritually, physically... Do I regret it? Some of it... But not all... 

I know I'm going to die alone, I accepted it... I'm 26 now, never dated, hell so socially awkward from being bullied all my childhood I doubt I can even talk to a woman... I don't really have anything to live for but the sunrise of tomorrow... 

So even if it's bitter sweet, it's ok... Life is hard but the hardship makes those special beautiful moments all the more... Never give up or surrender, even if it feels like it would be so good to just close your eyes and never wake up... God knows that I feel that way every morning... So take it from a burnt out cynical bastard, there is always a chance it'll get better... 

I wanted to just post something somewhere anonymously, to clear my chest... Stay frosty, and hopefully your days are better than mine...
