Hey guys,   
I just built a little web-app that shows other lonely souls around the world. 

[http://lonelyworld.info](http://lonelyworld.info) 

The locations are reported anonymously (you can share your location, too). 

The idea is, if you feel lonely, it might help to see that there are other lonely people out there who feel the same. We are not forever lonely, but just haven't found the right people to be with, who may be half-way across the world.

I suffered from loneliness which almost became depression during my PhD about 5 years ago. I am in a much better state now, and I wanted to do my part to help out other souls out there who might be going through what I went through.

Cheers.
