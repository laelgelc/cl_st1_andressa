Dad and i got kicked out of a RV park that we stayed at for five years in Maysville MI because a dick cowboy guy took it over so dad and i and also several of our friends got kicked out because he prever weekend warriors over us long term. So dad and i moved into a house. The only person that I have is just my dad now, who's often goes out of town to work. It seemed like it's easier meeting people in RV parks than in a neighborhood. Everything is walking distance, and I have more freedom. It's just harder to get to know anyone, and it's hard for me to get a job because I have a disability and have issues with simple tasks like money. I also can't drive. I don't wanna date or have someone constantly coming over, I just wish there was a hangout area where I could chat. The town has a bar and grill that i can walk to, but it's not much of a hangout place.
