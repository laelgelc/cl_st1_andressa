I lost my gf and nearly all my friends last year no one wants to see me or talk to me I never get texted by anyone other than family and like one friend I really need people in my life I’ve been so alone the past year just in my room I’m losing my personality and any motivation to do anything I’m not interested in anything anymore I just miss having people to talk to and share life with
