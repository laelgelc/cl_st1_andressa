40th birthday coming up. Current plan is to watch The Fifth Element and go to bed. 

If I’m pressed with the question of that I’d like to do, a small party with close friends and decent acquaintances would pass.  Tacos and Cards against humanity sounds like a good night. 

Indoor electric go-karts would be awesome, not gonna be likely though.

True desire would be spend the night with a special someone. There’s currently is no special someone.

It’s looking like a movie night so far
