If I had a soul to give to you.
Broken in pieces, unmendable. Strap together with leather
Walking down a path, not chosen for you. The sideways looks in the snide remarks just burning pieces of broken Heart's too afraid to stand. And as for me, that's not where I land i lift to hold to cradle to secure to protect to love. And destroy anything that opposes that protection
If only I was able to give you everything just to stop any hurt I would give it to you if I had it
