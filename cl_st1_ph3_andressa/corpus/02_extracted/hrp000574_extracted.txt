Find myself alone in the US on Thanksgiving for the 1st time since Covid. And before that while living abroad. Broke up with my live-in BF at the end of summer and FINALLY moving out next week. All friends and family live in NY (I’m in Northern VA) so saving $ by not traveling as the moving is getting $$$. I’ve been buying stuff for the new place as “retail therapy” wondering if I should have just gone.. I’ll see them for Xmas/Yule… NYE going with friends from there to Vegas (somehow), should be excited … but being here without family and friends (my cousin and her fam are local but going to MD)… my friends - even my ex - have SOs / work today… just me and my emotional support pet (cat ive had on and off 13 years)… I think I’ll go see Brendan Frazier in Rental Family and eat at Cracker Barrel then call my folks .. wish this day would end fast.. wondering what got me here…. Anyone else in a similar sitch this holiday?
