I just want a friend,a best friend
Few friends to hangout with 
I think that will be enough I'm okay with not finding love in life

I'm lonely, completely lonely so much to a point that i have no one to share my thoughts,my pain and sometimes my small achievements with. Someone whom i can rely on...

It fucking hurts to be this lonely 

All my life I've never really found one true friend I've just been used and dumped and not just by my dates but also by so called friends

It's so lonely at some point that i don't even want to l**e anymore or sometimes I just want to disappear forever 

I've tried enough, nearly for 2 years it's not working at all.

I'm turning 20 this year so currently 19f last time when I genuinely had friends was prolly 17
