no one is remotely interested in to talking to me. i have no friends in real life or online. ive always been a quiet and shy person and i thought the internet was the only place where i could make friends yet half of my life being spent here still ended up of me being alone. i always try to talk to  people who i pair up with in video games but they are always either uninterested or is talking to another person in game. ive tried friend making apps and even dating apps but none of them i could get a relationship out of. I feel like im just destined to be alone no matter what and that im a boring and awful person to be with
