Why me ? What i have done before to going through that ? Did i piss off the god ? And now he punishing me ? 

I left school at 6th grade. Finishing uni this year. No friends from school, uni, city, or anyone random. 

Why am i so lonely ? Is it too much to ask have someone who can hang out with, talk or get a text daily ? 

I'm boring and not good for people.

This is what i ask myself daily.

Thank you.
