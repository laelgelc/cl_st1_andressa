Sometimes loneliness isn’t about having no one around,

it’s about not having a place where you can say things as they are,

without having to fix them for other people.

I don’t know what the “right” thing to do is.

I just wanted to say that what you’re feeling makes sense.

I don’t always have the space to talk privately with everyone,

but I wanted to acknowledge what you shared here.
