I’m 17 and I have no friends. The thing is that it’s my own fault. I just hate myself when I’m with other people my age, it’s like having a bunch of mirrors around you just reflecting everything you do. Every time I interact with someone that’s not like my mom or a relative, I walk away feeling stupid and hating myself. When I went to school you kind of got that social life a little bit for free even though it was exhausting but now when I’ve dropped out (only for a year, planning on going back next year) I notice how I crave some sort of belonging in the shape of having friends. But every time I start getting close with someone I just push them away, both cause I hate myself when I hang out with them but also cause I feel like I can’t handle to have a relationship that has responsibilities and stuff. How do I fix this
