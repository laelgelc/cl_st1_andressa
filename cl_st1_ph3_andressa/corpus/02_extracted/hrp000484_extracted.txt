Every time that I try to socialize with people I end up annoying them in some way, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to socalize without bothering people.

I've already stopped sharing with people how I feel, especially if something is bothering me. No one wants to hear that their friend is sad, tired, anxious, ect. It's draining on them and won't make you feel any better. And being too excited or happy is also very draining as well, and the energy can be too much. I've found it best to just stay neutral. Don't have opinions, don't express feelings ESPECIALLY if upset. There's no point in it.

And then theres the fact that I used to talk too much. I've tried to cut down on how much I talk untill people no longer got upset with me or pushed me away, and I'm at the point now where I know to only speak when spoken to. No one wants to hear an opinion, fact, comment unless they ask for it. So there's no sense to say anything unless someone speaks to me first. But then that also has its own issues. People often think I am upset with them because I don't share things or because I seem cold and distant, so it'd a double edged sword. If I speak I'm annoying. If I don't I'm antisocial. It seems that there is no middle ground.

So, I've just decided it's not worth it anymore. I'm done trying to socialize. I'm done trying to have friends. I'm done just always being an annoying problem so I would rather just be nobody. Someone who stays in the background so well it's like they don't exist. Sure it means that I am growing increasingly more lonely, but it's annoying trade off for being able to not upset people.
