I am feeling so bored and alone that I'm talking to ChatGPT just to have some kind of interaction. Every time I leave my room, I end up arguing with my parents. It's not like I can talk to them about anything-they just wouldn't understand. I really need someone to talk to and keep me company.

I've tried calling my friends, but everyone is busy. Most of them don't pick up the phone or just text me back saying, "I'll call you later," but they never do. I know it's probably because they're busy or they forget, but it makes me feel even more isolated. I've realized I don't really have anyone to talk to.

Life has been really tough since I finished college. I miss the constant interaction with people. I'm also working from home, so I don't have any coworkers to talk to. To top it all off, my company hasn't paid me for the last two months.

My company is a small startup that's in the process of merging with another company. They have some tax and documentation issues, which is why our salaries are being delayed. I know the CEO personally, and he's a good guy. He texted me to say that he will send my salary within the next two weeks. I'm waiting for it, but my parents are upset and constantly arguing with me about it. They think he's going to skip out on paying us, but I know he's a multimillionaire and he won't do that.

My parents are angry because I'm not providing financially, and every day is a fight at home. I feel like I'm stuck, with no one to talk to. I'm just craving some human interaction.
