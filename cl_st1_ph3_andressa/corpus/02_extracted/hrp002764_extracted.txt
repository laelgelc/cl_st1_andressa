I only have two friends that I hang out with. We all get along fairly well but they are able to talk about more things with each other without me. I’m not working right now but I’m in search of a job. I’m also going to school as well but they always seem to give me shit for not working. I like hanging out with them but sometimes I feel that it would be better if I wasn’t in the picture. I’m uncomfortable when I’m out with them because I always seem to be the butt of their jokes. One of them likes to insult me while the other tags along with it. Our friendship is strange but they are the only real friends I have. Everybody else has taken advantage of my kindness and they’re all that’s left of my friends. I’m going to be transferring to an out of state school where I won’t see them for a while. Should I drop them or just suck it up?
