I’m a sophomore in college, and I feel more alone than ever. Sucks cause it’s a new year but oh well. 

I’ve made connections. I’m part of the film side of my school which means I know people to help me with projects and all (at least a few, every other film student is stuck up lol), but I don’t actually have friends. I broke up with my girlfriend because the spark was gone for me and I felt okay at first, but now I feel regretful. My best friend put me before someone else and sort of did me dirty, so I don’t trust him anymore. And my family shuts me out a lot of the time. Don’t know why, they just do.

I don’t know what to do. People always say “you’re young don’t worry” but it’s been like this for as long as I can remember. Ive tried to start friendships and they’ve never gone anywhere, I’ve tried to grow the gut to ask a girl out and get rejected a lot. I’m not even a weird dude cause if I was I wouldn’t question it. I think I’m just destined to be alone, and I should start getting used to it.
