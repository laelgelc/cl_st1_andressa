I'm feeling lonely lately and hoping to connect with some awesome women in my life. I'm 23, have a partner (so strictly platonic friendships only!), and I'm really craving some genuine female companionship.

I'm looking for friends to chat with about anything and everything – from the latest Netflix binge to life's ups and downs.  Someone to text and call every so often, explore new hobbies, or just vent to after a long day.  Basically, a good friend to share life with!

I'm into piano, music, poetry, language learning, reading, animals...lots more.  If you share any of these interests, or just enjoy good conversation, I'd love to hear from you!

Please, only genuine friendship inquiries.  I'm not looking for anything romantic or sexual.  Just good, old-fashioned friendship. 😊

Feel free to comment or send me a DM.  Looking forward to connecting
