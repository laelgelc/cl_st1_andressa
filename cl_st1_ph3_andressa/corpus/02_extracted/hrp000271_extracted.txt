So I'm alone, its my own fault but it still sucks. I miss being able to talk to people. I wish i could go back in time and change everything but i cant change the past. I just made it much worse like i normally do. I'm not sure why i mess everything up. It's just something i seem to do. The only communication i get is with my dog as no one else wants to talk to me. It's gone all dark again, being alone makes my life 10 xs worse but i get that is what i deserve. Sigh i hate my life right now.
