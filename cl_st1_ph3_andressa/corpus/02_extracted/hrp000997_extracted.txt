I have no friends and  havent had a girlfriend in 7 years. I spent most of my life working and being the polite guy that does what he has been told. In tune with it, I'm also a boring person that is the everyday man that nobody wants to become. I'm not hated, just unremarkable in any way. People don't mind my presence, but they don't want more of it either.

I'm 39 years old and only see a wasted life. I traveled, I worked and  but never had someone to share it with in 7 years, and that makes it feel empty. While other people learnt to be social and to love and be loved, I know less about it than a teenager, and it shows, tinder or fb dating  or cold approach or asking out after getting to know someone a bit know resulted in the same, I'm not interesting and not seen as a potential partner, I'm nto attractive or desirable.

"relationships won't fix your life"

"it's not all that good as you think it is."

I know. But while they don't make things necessarily better, life is plain bad without love to me and had no point.

I'm now working a job that brings cash I have no reason to give out, i am about to lose my medical insurance because the state says i make to much money yet i can barely afford my bills and i have a untreated chronic illness. the fact that a lonely life isn't worth living.

I have no family or friends to speak of zero I'll read and prepare my exit in the meantime. Eat sleep and work is not worth it running this endless rat race anymore if this is all i do is eat sleep and work with no substance i feel hoplessness and empty like i dont even know if i even exist i never thought 25 years ago i would be at this place in my life surrounded by nothing but sadness and anger and frustration and emptiness.
