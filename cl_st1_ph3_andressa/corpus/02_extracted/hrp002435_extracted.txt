It's the hug that does it. The hug is purely platonic from this man, and I'm not reading anything into it at all, but I crave touch so much. I'm alone... I have no one, and this man from church gives me a hug. Not a cautious hug. Not an inappropriate hug. He gives he such an embracing, strong, enveloping hug that for a moment it puts all the broken pieces back together. And for that few seconds I feel whole again.
