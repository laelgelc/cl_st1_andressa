I'm sitting at home in my room in the dark texting with my roommate who I sort-of-low-key regret allowing to move in with me. I didn't know her before allowing her to move in and I am starting to sort of know her now. 

She is lively and social and just the complete opposite of me. She was down on hard times when she asked to move in and I only sort of met her once when I needed a big favor and didn't have anyone else in my life to ask. 

I'm becoming more and more despondent the longer she stays here because of the complex opposite kind of life she has. I don't have anything to offer anyone. I'm middle aged and I have zero friends. Everyone I had ever paid to enter my life and be my friend is now long gone. 

I don't want to be her friend. It's painful to even be around her. 

I'm actually starting to feel so depressed that I'm not even hungry anymore. My stomach hurts from hunger but chewing and swallowing sounds like too much work. I've been despondent before but not like this. 

I grew up in an extremely odd and isolating manner and I was never allowed to have any friends. It was a cult, but limited to the four walls of the house that I was never allowed to leave. 

I never developed a personality because it was drilled into me that the world was going to end and the only thing that mattered was fighting off the evil doers until the bitter end, the extermination of the saints and all that jazz. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is - this feels like a new low for me.  I think that the only way I ever felt this bad about my life and lack of hope, in the past, was when I was consuming alcohol. Alcohol of course is a depressant but I haven't touched it in a long time now. This feels bad. I feel like loneliness is taking the life force out of me. Does anyone else feel like this?
