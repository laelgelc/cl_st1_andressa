I'm 29F, physically disabled, can't drive because of it.  Have difficulty getting a job because I can't drive.  

My lack of job means I have no real adult experience with life. I have more in common with 13-year-olds than I do with people my own age. I can't read social signals easily, and often miss what might be obvious to most. 

Example? I called one of my friends "pookie" as a kind of joke, and she had said that her stepdaughter used to do the same 💀 and she didn't exactly *like* her stepdaughter.  Just a few days ago, I made a PASSIVE comment about staying over as a joke, and then both my friend and her husband INSISTED I stay over 💀 and I didn't know how to get out of it so I gave in and felt awkward the whole time 🙃 

I can't be friends with teenagers, because that's creepy given my age. I can't be genuine friends with anyone my age because I don't have a mortgage, car, job, home, usual bills, or any other usual adult milestone. I just feel dead. Lonely.  💔
