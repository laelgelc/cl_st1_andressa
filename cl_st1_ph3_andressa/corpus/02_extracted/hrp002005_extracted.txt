Hi all I am a 32m in the UK, I have been alone now for over 2 years I am a hard working individual who owns there own home and car with 0 debt, I make good money and have worked my entire life, but for about the last year I have felt cripplingly lonely, I have tried to meet people both irl and through those dating apps (what a complete waste of time these are) and apparently from all of this all i have managed to find are people that just want to ask me for money?!?! I have never given anyone anything as no one has ever given me anything, I have kept telling myself that not everyone's like this but it's harder and harder every day to convince myself this is true, im not really looking for much a smile usually does me but I just can't find it, and have often found myself questioning what is the point in all I have worked for if I can't have someone to share it with? These thoughts lead me down a dark road that just gets darker every time I go there, I am in pain here, I feel like there is a huge hole in my life, id like a family and someone to share this life with but all life gives me are piss takers...... please tell me I am not the only one who feels like this??
