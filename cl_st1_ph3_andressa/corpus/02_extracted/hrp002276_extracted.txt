Recently, I’ve been becoming afraid of ending up lonely for the rest of my life. I’m about to turn 19, and my sociability isn’t very good. I spent all of high school feeling lonely, talking to one or two people and never going out to do anything, and now, in college, I don’t have any friends anymore. If things continue this way, I feel like I’ll be lonely forever, but at the same time, I also think that I don’t want to make friends. I don’t want to put in the effort to build friendships from scratch (especially since meeting new people is uncomfortable); I just wish reality were different.

When I think that I’ll live alone until I die, it scares me, because it also seems to be equivalent, to some extent, to living sadly or not very satisfied with life until the end of my life. And I would also like to have a girlfriend and do the same activities that couples usually do. Maybe I wouldn’t actually like it in practice, but that’s how I feel when I see works of entertainment; I think that maybe there could exist a girlfriend with that same archetype that attracts me so much. But if I remain lonely, nothing will change, and I won’t have a girlfriend to satisfy me emotionally and physically. The same goes for friends: I wouldn’t have anyone to talk to.

I fear that if I continue like this, my life will remain exactly the same forever. At the same time, I also think that my tendency really is not to be socially successful. In any case, the fear of living and dying alone remains.
