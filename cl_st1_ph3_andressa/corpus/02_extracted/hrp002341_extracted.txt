I’m a 26F. I don’t have friends. Like literally zero. I have “so-called” friends, but they barely talk to me or only reach out when they want something. No group chat, no “let’s hang out,” no one to text at 2 a.m. about some random thought that keeps me up.

Somehow everyone vanished. Now my social circle is just me… and me again.

Just checking, does anyone actually have friends, or is this normal?
