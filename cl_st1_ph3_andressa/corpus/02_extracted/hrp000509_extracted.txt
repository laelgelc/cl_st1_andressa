You ever just feel like screaming at the top of your lungs but you just sit in silence? That's how im feeling. And its been lingering for a few days.

Trying to make friends is hard. Finding who you vibe with is hard and nobody really sticks around long. And any connections are none existent. So what do you do just suffer? I swear its times i dont wanna be here anymore. Im tired.
