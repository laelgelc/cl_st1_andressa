I wish there was something like this available. 

I know it’s really sad but this is where I’m at. 

It would be cool if there was an app where you could  receive simulated notifications and messages throughout the day from simulated social media apps so I could at least “feel” like I’m still connected with the world. 

I barely get any real notifications or messages these days. 

An illusion like this could help with my crippling loneliness? 

Artificial dopamine hits, sign me up.
