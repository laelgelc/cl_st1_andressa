Hi everyone! 

So I tend to ask people to do things with me and if they don’t or refuse I don’t do things I want to do for example 
- go skating 
- go to the park 
- go to a place (coffee shop) 
- stay alone in school (very nerve raking for me when I’m alone )

(I listed the smallest things there is a lot more) 

And now I decided I want to things alone or I will never get to do things I want to do. 

I am ready to live and try to live my life please give me tips and things you do I should try alone 

Thank you mate 😋
