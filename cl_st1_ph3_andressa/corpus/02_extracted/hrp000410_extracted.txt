TLDR: I’m dramatic and I need to vent lol

Hey just posting to get out some thoughts. 
All of my life I’ve struggled with depression. Thoughts of the worst things swirling around constantly. Though the thoughts were bad, being alone was the normal and the comfort. Until I found someone that was able to make the voices and thought come to a calm quiet. Or at least for a short time. Instead of getting the help I needed I used being in a relationship as a remedy to fix my issues. When it inevitably ended I realized that I was now alone again, but this time not by choice. Since then it’s felt like I’m meant to be alone. Like I don’t deserve the warm calmness of someone else’s existence. I know that it’s just my underdeveloped ill-minded brain talking, but it’s exhausting. Constantly thinking that you’re not worth living, love, or the comfort of others is so exhausting. 
I know this has been nonsensical and dramatic but it’s been nice to write.
