As you may have seen from other posts, we're working on the idea of a hackathon on loneliness. 

You find ideas and notes in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/wiki/index). 

We're currently looking for additional team members. We are particularly looking for people experience in project development/innovation but also for people with a background in communication, design, web development.
