I have friends, I just don't feel close to them. I mean like I talk to them in school and we seem like friends but once I get out of school I don't get like invites to hangout I don't get texts from them I just sit alone in my room doom scrolling. I have spent summers where I have gotten like a handful of texts from a single person. I'm not alone I don't sit alone at lunch which I am very thankful for as it sucked in the beginning of high school. I just don't feel close to anybody I have nobody to tell how I'm feeling or anybody to hang out with. Am I alone on this one or am I just complaining?

Sorry for bad grammar.
