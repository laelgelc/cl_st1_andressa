Anyone else?

I don’t have cousins, siblings or anyone. Just me. It’s getting maddening. I’m 30 years old and the isolation just seems to be getting worse. The friends I make all end up coupling up and dropping off or being shitty friends. When I say shitty friends, I mean it. I am proactive with making an effort to socialize. 

I don’t like my reality.

I dated a guy a few years ago who was so cruel himself I feel turned off by dating still. I could have sued him for one of the many abusive things he did but I waited too long to take legal action.

I feel beat down by life and haven’t met people who can relate. I’m tired of doing everything by myself and I’m tired of getting hurt.

This has been a struggle from childhood until now. I’ve been in therapy for years. 

At least I have my dog <3

I am just genuinely hoping to relate to someone else with no siblings, adult child of abusive parents and no extended family. It’s a really painful predicament and I’ve not met someone else in it as well (sorry if you are)
