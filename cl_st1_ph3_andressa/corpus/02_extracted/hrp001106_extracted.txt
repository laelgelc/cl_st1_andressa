Lost both my parents in the last two years and my brother lives Florida. I am a born and bread Texan. I’ve suffered three strokes and am not able to work. So any chance of meeting someone or making friends is difficult.  All I can think about is suicide. But I gave my gun to my brother so I can’t kill myself. At least not easily. I live in relatively small town. And all this ice stops me from driving around today.  So that’s my story. Any good advice out there? Maybe just writing this helped a little.
