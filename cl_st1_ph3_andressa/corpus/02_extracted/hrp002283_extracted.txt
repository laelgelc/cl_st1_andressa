It’s starting to hit me that I’ve lived a very lonely life. I’m always alone and it’s gotten to a point where I just feel numb now like I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do. I talk to people here and there but I don’t really have anyone that I’m close with or I see on a daily basis. It’s just wild how even homeless people are less lonely than me, I see so many homeless couples who are there for each other and I’m like damn that must be nice. And everytime I go out, I see people together all the time and I’m the only one who is by themselves, it just makes me wonder what am I doing wrong, what’s wrong with me.
