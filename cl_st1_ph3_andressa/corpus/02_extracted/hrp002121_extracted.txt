So I spend most of my time on my own, I’m quite social and keep busy and this is something I’m comfortable with. 

But from time to time it is nice to feel wanted, to have someone be excited to see me or excited to talk to me… yeah that’s probably what I’m struggling  with rn. 

Just want to feel wanted.
