I'm always alone on my birthday every year. Just got done with a toxic relationship with a bipolar individual that I wasted 2 months being with. Tired of suffering through the holidays and birthdays every year around this time it doesn't help when it gets dark earlier and you see all the. people with their Normie relationships and make it look like it's so easy to get in.and out of a healthy loving relationship and not a toxic one. I just wish for once one year I could just be happy and not be tormented by loneliness. And actually have maybe a real friendship with a human being if not a real loving genuine relationship with somebody that isn't completely insane or psycho and is loving towards me unconditionally and accept me for who I am with my flaws like I would accept them that doesn't seem to happen though ever.
