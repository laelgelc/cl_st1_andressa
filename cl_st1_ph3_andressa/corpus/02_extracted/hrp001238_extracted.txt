I'm over thirty. I've began my gender transition back in 2023 and it was the best decision ever, self-hate and related mental issues are officially a thing of the past, but today several issues consume me. For one the anti-trans international climate, I fear for my life every day. On the other hand... Severe loneliness. I've been single since 2017 and I can't take it anymore. I've been doing what every breathing human being says you have to do, I joined clubs, I went to therapy, I've improved myself, I hit the gym regularly, I reinforced doing my hobbies, I've met a lot of people and made lots of friends but... Nothing. Everyone around me has a special person, wife, husband, boyfriend or girlfriend, everyone BUT me. Everyone (who already are in years-long relationships) just vomits the clichés of "love will find you when you least expect it!" "love is just around the corner"

Sorry but no, I'm autistic of the introverted type, I've walked way out of my legit comfort zone being more extroverted, I tried to engage more people I'm interested in (to no avail), I've also tried giving up and not looking for anyone and nothing...

What is the point of living if I'm going to live every fucking day alone? friends can barely get time on their agendas to do stuff and honestly... with 9 years of singleness I... I don't know what to do. i feel lonely to the point of becoming a reccurent thought that fuels suicidal thoughts... I already requested my therapist to make the paperwork to get an appointment with a psychiatrist to see if I can combat depression but... pills and friends ain't enough... Why does everyone else get to enjoy love but not me? I legit try not to compare but literally, everyone around me...

I can't live like this
