hi, this is my first time writing here. Im 18 yo, i have a relationship and some friends however i can not stop feeling alone. I feel like i am in need of people, i dont want to feel like this.

even though some people are here for me i am not. No matter what happens i never support myself . im afraid the lack of self compassion is about to turn me into someone  who is so desperate for compassion. 

my therapist and the ones i had before her had tried to help me but no luck. Anyone who is experiencing smth similar ?
