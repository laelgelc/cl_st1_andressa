I think I'm alone because I don't like myself. Maybe people can sense that I'm insecure and don't like myself, and as a result, find me off-putting.

But that's only my best guess; I don't actually know why I can't get along with people. Even if I truly knew why I don't get along with people well, there is no guarantee that I'll find a solution to my problems.
