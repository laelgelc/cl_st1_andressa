As we’re very close to the start of the holiday season it’s not hard to feel the heaviness of loneliness that we carry. Sometimes we get stuck on the idea that we’re not good enough. I want you all to know that I appreciate every one of you for offering support to me during the tough times and offering the same those who need it on here. And to those who need to hear this, know that YOU ARE good enough and know that you’re NOT ALONE this holiday season. You have a friend in me and you’re welcome to reach out if you need someone to talk with.
