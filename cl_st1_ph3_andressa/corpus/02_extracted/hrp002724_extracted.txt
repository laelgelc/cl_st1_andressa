So I'm just finished Basic Training. I thought I would be less of a loser loner after I came back here but such is not the case. At least I passed which is more than everyone thought I would do. I finally leave my room and I think I've discovered that I actually hate people. My entire time in basic other people only held me back. Either intentionally or unintentionally. I think I might be better off being a loner. Other people are kind off cancer.
