i just wanna live like a normal person.. why cant i have that.. im always miserable.. 

Hello everyone.. i hope some take the time to read this i just need to be heard. have you ever felt like you’ve been running your whole life?.. trying not to be miserable but really its just the way things will always be. im ending my life, tonight :)) 

i grew up with no parents to care for me, my dad died when i was a baby bcs he overdosed with drugs and my mom was also an addict but decided to keep me… all throughout my childhood my mom beat me a week wont pass by where i wont get beaten to sleep. thats just how things were. the beating only stopped when i turned 16 bcs i decided to work, i was always not at home so my mom couldn’t do it anymore.. we rent a small apartment so eversince ive worked ive been paying that. i pay for my schooling too ever since 16… im 18 now but you know what makes this worse? im in fucking debt… my mom used my name to buy drugs 🙂 so now i owe money to people idk, ive been hiding for a few months now bcs theyre on the hunt for me to pay it.. im scared for my life and idk what to do.. they always come and beat me when they spot me.. i dont even have a friend or anything bcs my only friend got sick of it.. i just wanna end it all.. i just wanna kms.. im so depressed.. what im feeling and experiencing rn is something i wouldn’t wish on anyone.. 

if ure gonna have children, please be responsible enough to actually take care of them… all ive wanted my entire life is to have stable education and a home where i felt safe.. but i couldnt have that i got the worst of the opposite. idk what to do anymore, by the time ive posted this im probably already kms.. ty for listening… atleast someone did for the first time….
