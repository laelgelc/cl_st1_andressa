Hi im 16M and... Well when i was 11 i started feeling lonely than no one loves me or care about me and my emotions and that drags me to my depression i've been bullied in my school being called by names and the other sad things... i wanted to end this but i reminded my self that i have a friend i have to rescue from his depression and i started my mission and i made a promise to myself that i will never forget about him and never leave him no matter what. Ok but back to me, i'm still feel alone that much when i want to cry but i cant i just wanna feel someone's hugging me and told me everything is okay...
