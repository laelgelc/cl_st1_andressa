I am being loved but I still feel lonely and torment.

It is tough to be a normal person.

I miss my friends and parents. I miss the food.

I have everything but I lost myself.

Giving is the best , but nothing left when I gave up my career. I can’t communicate to the same age ppl. They are more realistic, talking about earning money. Maybe I am still childish. I still miss the moments when I have my own career and fight for this. Ppl always said that it is good for a woman who have nothing to do. But it is sad. Actually you gotta lost yourself. You will confuse about your personal values. Love and marriage is not a necessary processing in our life. Be careful and be awake.
