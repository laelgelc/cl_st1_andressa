22(F)so I am preparing for competitive exams and I am not able ton clear them this will be my i think 5th attempt and dad at my home I feel is irritated from me as I earn nothing and sit at home.

my studies are not going well and I have vitiligo it affects my appearance and I feel insecure everytime I look in the mirror and my ex also broke up with 5 year relationship in which he cheated and lied to me many times. i don't if my appearance has to do with it.

  i have no friends to share it with I used to share stuff about my vitiligo with day but he just seems to taunt me and I just feel so unworthy and wanting to die I think nobody needs me anyway I'm just unnessary weight on the earth 

I feel really Lonely and nothing seems to uplift my mood I just feel so depressed and I also can't take therapy because of financial reasons and non availability of any good therapist in my area where it is shameful to go to a therapist. 

i just want to feel loved without any conditions and feel heard and wanted. right now I only see physically hurting myself to cope with the mental stress
