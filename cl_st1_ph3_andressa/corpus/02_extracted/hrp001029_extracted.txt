Do you guys ever feel like you need to justify your existence in a friend group or justify every time you are talking to someone new? It feels like this world is split into people who get invited to things and people who invite others. I've never been in a social gathering I didn't host and it seems like I'm the only one in my friend group who doesn't get invited to events. It doesn't help that my self-image is poor and objectively my friends are more charismatic. I try not to ruin the few friendships I have by keeping to myself on loneliness but in the few times I've spoken about this, they always shut me down and act like I'm insane for believing this. I love my friends and only wish the best for them but I don't think they understand what it's like. I don't hold myself above being a little cuckoo bananas so I guess I was just wondering if this is a common feeling.
