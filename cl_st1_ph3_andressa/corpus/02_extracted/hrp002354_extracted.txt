November 2024, after much deliberation and research and heartache, I officially de-converted from evangelical Christianity. I grew up in a Christian household. Going to church 4+ times a week. I also went to a tiny private Christian school from kindergarten up till graduation. I was the only high schooler in that school for my last two years of high school. So, I already don’t have high school friends because of that. I also went to a private Christian college for all 4 years of my bachelor’s. And I do have a couple friends from college who live in my area still who I keep in touch with. However, since my deconversion, I have not been able to muster the courage to be candid with my Christian friends or family. It will cause a lot of problems I am not ready to deal with at this time. But I feel so unbelievably alone because I cannot be fully authentic with my only friends who live near me. It’s so difficult making friends I can truly connect with and be fully genuine with at this stage in my life. And during this whole process it has been hard not to feel like no one understand what I’m going through. So I’m letting this out here where I am at liberty to. I don’t want to lose the only few friendships I have but I still feel lonely with the few people I know because I’m unable to be my true self at this point. It’s a conundrum.
