Because of my extreme shyness, I've become friendless. Since childhood, I've had friends in the neighborhood, but I never went out to play with them. Then I moved, and since then, I've completely cut myself off from people. I'm shy around my neighbors and everyone else. Even on Instagram and Messenger, I don't talk to anyone; it's as if I exist but I'm invisible. I feel a terrible loneliness, as if I'm broken inside. I carry this silence with me every day and wonder if anyone else is going through the same thing.
