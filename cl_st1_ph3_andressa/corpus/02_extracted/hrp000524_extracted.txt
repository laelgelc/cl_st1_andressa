For as long as I can remember I have always been a loner type.. through middle school and high school I ate lunch in either empty hall ways or teachers classes cause I was physically bullied for being one of the only openly gay guys in school.. wanted to be away from anyone and everyone. Now I’m an adult I find I can only be around people and enjoy it when I’m drunk, I wish I wasn’t such an anxious person so I could live a normal life without alcohol.. it’s the only thing that brings me happiness and any form of social interaction now…
