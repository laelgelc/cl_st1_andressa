i need some advice

(before i say anything i’d like to say that i’m pretty new to reddit and i’m still learning the basics.) so i’m aware that this probably won’t be seen, but i could really use some help. there’s this girl that i became friends with last year, but over time i’ve been able to see her true colors and i no longer want to be friends with her. the problem is, she’s part of my main friend group and if i try to terminate our friendship, then i’ll be risking messing up all of my other friendships in this group. i really don’t want that to happen because they’re the only genuine people in my grade, and i’d be screwed without them. even within my group, i still feel left out the majority of the time. if anyone else is feeling lonely, feel free to message me, i would love to talk and give help if i can. :)
