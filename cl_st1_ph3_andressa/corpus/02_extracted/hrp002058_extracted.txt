Online, I see so many posts of men acting just downright stupid. So many posts of men getting super sexual within the first few messages of dating apps. Posts about men acting super disrespectful or inconsiderate toward women when they go out on dates with them.

Other posts on online about women in relationships who are being mistreated by their man.

And then I realize (or I've always realized) that I don't even get matches on dating apps. I don't even have the opportunity to message a girl. I don't even have the opportunity to take a girl out on dates. I haven't been in a long term relationship.

All these guys who are super disrespectful toward women. They are the ones who are succeeding in dating life. Not me. I'm even worse than them, somehow? Idk how to reconcile this. It's really tough.
