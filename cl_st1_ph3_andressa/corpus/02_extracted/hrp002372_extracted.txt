Being ghosted sucks especially when you’ve opened up to someone, shared things you’ve never told anyone, and then they disappear. That kind of hurt cuts deep.

I see it happen a lot, even on this subreddit. I get that some people can’t listen or don’t feel comfortable, but that doesn’t make the pain any less real. That’s why many are afraid to open up, especially when they’re already at a low point. Being alone can make us feel invisible, like nobody cares. Whatever happened to compassion?

This place exists so we can show how we really feel, express ourselves without fear, and be honest about our emotions. Your feelings matter. Here, we listen to understand the pain and do our best to support one another. Not everyone wants or needs that, but at least people can feel heard and not alone.
