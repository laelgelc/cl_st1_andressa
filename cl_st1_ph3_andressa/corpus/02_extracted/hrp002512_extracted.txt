I’m F21, have a boyfriend, unfortunately no friends, and I’ve become heavily reliant on my boyfriend over the years (6 years now😅) ANYWAY…. He’s started working (I don’t rlly work) and I am feeling so bad for sitting at home all day!!! I want to go out and do things but unfortunately there’s not much to do. How do I live a fun life???
