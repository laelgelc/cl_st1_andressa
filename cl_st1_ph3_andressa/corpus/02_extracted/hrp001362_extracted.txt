TW: Self cannibalism?? If this is a thing.... 


I'm lonely all the time, but atleast once every four days I have a terrible feeling of loneliness. It's terrible. But when I feel it I immediately get a very strong urge to start biting at my arm, like chewing and eating it. But doing it till the bone is exposed. Not swallowing the, flesh, though. 
Or if anyone interacts with me I get, very angry. And I just want to bite them in defense.

I tried looking some things up but could not find anything about it.

I don't know where else to post this. Because I just experience this feeling when I'm very lonely.
