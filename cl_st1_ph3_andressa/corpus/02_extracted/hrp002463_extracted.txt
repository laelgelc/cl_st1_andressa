I hate when I have day/days off from work. I moved to a new town almost two years ago and I've made no friends. I work in a factory and I've worked there for almost 2 years as well. I'm a younger girl and the only girl on my crew so I feel like that's one of the reasons on why I haven't made any friends. I absolutely dread having a day or days off and all I can think about is going back to work. I also think about how much I want to be called in on my day off. Does anyone else have this problem??
