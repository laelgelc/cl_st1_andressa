I am here on a long weekend, and there are a few things going on in my head. I wish I just had someone who could listen. When there is nothing to do and nothing to distract me, these thoughts become heavier and more destructive. This is one of those moments.

I do not have anyone in my life I can turn to in situations like this. People come and go, but no one stays long enough to truly listen or understand me. Sometimes I feel like no one really knows me at all, not the real me, only the version I show on the surface.

Day one passed without anything happening. I thought about going out, but I did not have the energy to even make the effort. I do have plans for tomorrow, so at least that should provide some distraction for most of the remaining days. People like me do not really live, we just get through each day. After this weekend, there will be another week, another month, another year to survive. That is what life feels like.
