I'm not going to lie to any of y'all, I have been feeling this way for a while and it only intensified. My ex boy friend broke up with me only 2 weeks before my birthday, after affirming me that nothing was wrong. Unfortunately, every time I get out of a relationship, I don't think of it as something I can learn from, I think of it as yet another failure does anyone have any advice on lovers are how to be successful with relationships, because I can't even reach one year yet, and I feel like I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be. I think the reason why I have so much pressure on myself is because I feel like I want to have kids and be married by 25 or at most 26. I am 21F right now and I am pretty much shaking in my boots because, yeah, that is technically 4 to 5 years, but the issue is, I still need to give the guy time to want to love me and want to put a ring on me and engagement and all that.
