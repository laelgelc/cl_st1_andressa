Ever since I was in middle school, I've spent most of my years being attached to someone to the point of obsessively thinking about them and analyzing their behavior with me.

First it was authority figures I admired, and now it's one of my friends. 

The moment someone shows me the slightest kindness or treats me nicely, I get attached really strongly. The only thing that ends is the next attachment. And so on.

I've tried to stop the cycle, but I fall into the same trap again, and I burn a lot of time and energy worrying whether I'm going to fall out of their graces or something. And idealizing the other person of course. 

It gets so strong that a single hi or smile from them can make or break my entire day.
