I’m 21M And since I have been 13 I never had true friends. Ate lunch alone in school, was bullied and deeply isolated and nobody cared about me in school

In college I tried to change things around, and although people are not rude anymore they just don’t care to make friends with me. I joined club, talk to people in class, go volunteering, start small talk with people, but it goes nowhere. Nobody reciprocates that energy back. 

Everyday feels like Groundhog Day from the longtime because of this loneliness and feeling of isolation. Everyone I join a club or organization and talk to people it feels like a losing battle, because I never get that energy reciprocated back. 



i feel numb and empty and those years of sadness now dissolved into an inner void, a void that lacks the love and attention I wanted.
