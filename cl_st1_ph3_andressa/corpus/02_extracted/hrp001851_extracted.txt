I’m part of a small online friend group of 5-6 people. I’ve known two of them for over six years—let’s call them Jeff and Steve. Jeff is pretty well-known to everyone, and the feeling is mutual since he’s the one who introduced most of us to each other.

Now, Steve... Well, he’s not exactly fond of me. He can be pretty toxic at times, and I’ve noticed that most of his trash-talking seems to be directed at me. I’ve talked to Jeff about it before, and he kind of brushed it off, saying that since Steve and I have known each other for so long, there’s bound to be some tension. He said, “Steve’s just being Steve.” But then I start wondering—is it really just Steve being himself, or is it because I genuinely annoy him? Sometimes, Steve says things like, “You’re so corny,” or “I’m tired of hearing your voice and laugh.” While everybody was laughing. It’s not like he’s saying that to anyone else in particular, which makes me question if there’s something about me that triggers him.

Jeff, on the other hand, is someone I can trust. But even with him, I can’t help but feel a little uncertain. We were once joking around, comparing ourselves to school stereotypes, like "Jeff would be the quiet kid," or "Someone else is the jock or the nerd." When I asked about myself, Jeff said, “You’d be the kid who sneaks into the girls' locker room—except you’re not even hiding in the closet, you’re just out of the closet.” I laughed it off, but later I started wondering if Jeff actually sees me like that. Was he just joking, or did he mean something else? Does he think of me as a creep or someone who’s just a little too mischievous? I honestly could not tell... Altough, he did claim that me & Steve are chaotic, just that i am more loud?

I guess my main concern is whether I’m the problem or if they are. Maybe I’m overthinking things, but something just feels off. Honestly, I worry that if I disappeared from the group, no one would notice... or worse, no one would care.
