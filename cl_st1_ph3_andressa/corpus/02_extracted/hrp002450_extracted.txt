A few days ago I broke up with my lover, it was very confusing for me to decide how to feel, I didn’t cry, but I felt some kind of pain in my chest that I couldn’t quite identify. 

He was my first, I never was a girl who believes in love, having so much sexual trauma along with parents in a bad marriage, left me denying that love is even real. 

We met online 5 years ago so we grew up from being teenagers to young adults together, he admitted his feelings for me last April, it was then I realized how much effects he has on me and how I’ve never felt like this with any other guy. 

I knew this day when we would break up will come, I just didn’t expect it to be so soon. 

The moment of silence that followed made me realize how lonely my life has my life recently been. 

In the 11th grade I lost my best friends of 6 years, back then I felt lonely and devastated but my family had my back, we went to trips and watched movies together. Me, my mom and my two brothers. 

However this changed, quickly. I don’t even remember what happened, we just aren’t spending as much time together and everything started to feel more and more formal. 

It makes me feel so sad when my therapist ask me to try and spend time with my family, not knowing how to tell her that it’ll never be the same anymore. 

I just find both pain and comfort in my loneliness, I want to get to know people and to listen for other point of views. But what if I get hurt again? Every relationship will eventually come to an end, how do I know this end won’t hurt me?
