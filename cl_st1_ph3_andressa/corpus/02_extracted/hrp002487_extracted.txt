I feel very lonely these days.
I’m not really good at talking to people in real life, but I really love talking to people.
My life was going pretty well before. I had everything I wanted, friends, I was doing well in my studies, and I even had a girlfriend. But because of my studies, I had to move to a different city. It has been almost seven months since I moved here, and I haven’t been able to make any friends.
At first, I used to chat with my old friends and my girlfriend through text. But we broke up last October, and since then I’ve started to feel very lonely because I used to spend most of my time with her, even if it was only through a screen.
After that, the only people I had were my old friends, but since I live in a different city now, we rarely talk. I don’t want to disturb them because they’re busy with their own lives. I’ve been feeling very lonely for the past three months, and now it’s getting harder to cope
