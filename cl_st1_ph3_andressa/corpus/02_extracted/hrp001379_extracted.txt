20M I have no friends, at least I used to, but I never really felt love toward them. 

Don’t get me wrong, they are very nice people, but I couldn’t help feeling lonely around them. The connection always felt surface level despite sharing laughs and jokes all day.

Perhaps my depression and anxiety don’t help either as it’s hard for me to befriend people. Even if I weren’t a weird introvert who lacks social skills I don’t think I’d be happy with the people I befriend. I just want a deep connection, people I love dearly, people I might be ready to die for.

I don’t know man I hate how in a moment of anger the person you started to love will try to belittle you in any way to make himself feel better or to win the argument. At that moment, I realize that whatever is between us isn’t nearly as deep as I thought, and the sad thing is most people would do this, perhaps even myself. I dunno man I just hate human nature, or whatever. None of this makes sense.
