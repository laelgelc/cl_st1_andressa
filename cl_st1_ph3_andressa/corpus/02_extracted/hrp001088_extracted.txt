I always thought i was so hated and ignored. But in reality that wasn't always the case. Current me likes to think that i never even got close to a normal life and basic intimacy, but thats not true. I would like to think there were people who took interest in me, i cant confirm because i never talked to them. but i took it for granted. Because i felt so lonely at the time.

I was reminded today that i actually had a friend once too, but my mind says i was never close to anyone to begin with.

Your rejected-> you close yourself off-> and become emotionally stunted

Loneliness is often fixed if its just circumstancial, but the moment i chose not express myself anymore is the exact point where it became my fault, that finalized and led to my life now. Where im so severely alienated that i think about my life daily.
