Lack of physical affection, feeling neglect, I only have online people I talk with but that doesn’t help the touch starvation. There’s a guy that has feelings for me but I’m not sure I like him back yet/confused feelings.. wants me to do things when I’m not in the mood for it or comfortable. Still miss cgl. Idk. Hope counsellor can make sense of these things.
