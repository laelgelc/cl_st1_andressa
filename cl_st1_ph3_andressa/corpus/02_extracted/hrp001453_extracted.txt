So pretty much i said some stupid things (not going to get into it) and a few of my friends are absolutely refusing to forgive me. And they have separate group chats and stuff and they have like, an echo chamber so I pretty much am just hated by a bunch of people now despite my sincerest efforts to reconcile and apologize. I go to school with these people and have classes with them and stuff so its weird. I just don’t know what to do now. The school isn’t very big so I feel sort of trapped for the rest of my time there? Is there any solution
