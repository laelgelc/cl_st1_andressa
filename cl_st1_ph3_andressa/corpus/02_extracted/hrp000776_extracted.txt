I think I know why my ' friends' ditched me .

They wanted to bully me , and I didn't let that happen. 

When they found out that I can't be bullied or controlled by them , they thought it's best to kick me out .

I know they want to see me all miserable and lonely in uni , when everyone else has friends and I have none .
But I'm not gonna be miserable , I am gonna stay calm , and perhaps normalise the self- company I have .
