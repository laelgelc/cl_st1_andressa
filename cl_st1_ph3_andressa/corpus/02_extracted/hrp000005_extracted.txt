Has anyone else ever experienced this?

How have you "managed" it or changed it (etc)?

I've moved cities quite a lot growing up, I lived and was schooled in 4 countries and had 6 schools and 2 universities.

Because of this there was a lot of "always the new kid" time happening - being the new kid, developing connections, having to move on, trying to keep connections that don't last, start again.

I found that almost always the reason (as far as I'm aware) that the friendship/connections didn't last when I'd moved away was that it's so much easier to maintain a relationship with someone that you see in person regularly and have big/small interactions with, than with someone who you need to send emails to/facetime - it's almost like the extra effort is too much in comparison to everyone else that's still there around you and you can see in person - a situation of out of sight out of mind.

I've been in the same location now for 5 years and have made fleeting friendship and aquiantances, but I can't seem to dredge up the emotions in me to put great effort into keeping up regular contact to deepen the relationship, or to dredge up the energy/desire to try to enter new friendships from people that I meet. I don't know if I'm trying to be subconsciously self-protective, or have slid into seeing people as just transient now. I would love to have the deep connections that you hear about or see online (etc), but at the moment I just feel largely unmoored from everyone.

Because this is not exactly the type of topic that you would enter into at a dinner party or find someone easily who quite understands or has been through something similar, then I don't know whether this is something that others have felt before, or whether it is something that I have developed by myself alone.
