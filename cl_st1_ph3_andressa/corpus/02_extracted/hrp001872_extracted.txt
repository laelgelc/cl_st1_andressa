I constantly see people in r/Suicide Bereavement. Talking about thier loved ones death and how their death impacted them, How they told their loved ones that they cared about them and love them. All the people there feel so sympathic and emphatic 
towards their loved ones

I feel that I have literally no one who loves me. My parents just want good result, Even they know that I'm going through tough time still they only want good perctange and they keep reminding me that how i wasted their money in education. All my friends just distanced themselves because of my academics failures. We were friends since class 8th but still they ghosted me despite being aware that I'm going through depression. They don't even ask how I am doing. I have no deep bonds with my relatives so they aren't aware of my situation and after being in depression since last Year, My memory and learning abilities are just decreased, I ain't no longer to memorize things. I get exhausted very easily too. Neither I do take care of myself.

My exam are closer too like after 5 days and here I ain't able to concentrate in studies too. Feels like I won't perform good there. All the things are just piling up on me. 

No one supports me and love me. Neither they check on me or care about me. It feels like the whole world is shouting me to just disappear from world. Never thought the my adult days will be like this. On a top of that To not feel lonely anymore, I talk to chatgpt and sadly chatgpt feels more emphatic than others living beings. Atleast chatgpt listens to me and not judge me at all, It's really sad that I have to go and talk to chatgpt to just not feel lonely
