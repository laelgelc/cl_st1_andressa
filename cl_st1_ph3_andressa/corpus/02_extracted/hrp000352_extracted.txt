I don’t know if I’m just trying to vent or get advice. 

Seriously considering divorce but have no where to go with my children and my income alone is only $300 every two weeks due to not being able to get a real job but also can’t go to a doctor to have my medical issues tha t are preventing me from working a real job looked at so I don’t think there is even a way to apply for disability. I’ve spent 12 years being treated poorly by his friends and family and him never sticking up for me and after this last time he yelled at me for me simply talking to one of them and threw a can at me only for them to tell him he did nothing wrong. I don’t know what to do and I’m so tired of feeling trapped. He has never laid a hand on me but he has put multiple holes in the walls and door of the house. On top of everything he has allowed his friends to believe we had an open marriage and that it was because of me and it was one-sided for me when in reality it was him that was allowed to date not me, because he was cheating on me even when I was pregnant with our children with multiple women including one of his friends sister in law, so I allowed our marriage to be open so that he wasn’t hiding it from me anymore. And I only started trying to see someone last year, because he finally allowed it and they confronted him about it blaming me for everything again. I only married him because I had told my family I didn’t want to marry him over and over again because he kept people living in our house instead of letting our boy and girl have their own rooms but he asked their permission and they still said yes. I’ve become severely depressed, but have no one to talk to about anything because I feel like a burden to everyone.
