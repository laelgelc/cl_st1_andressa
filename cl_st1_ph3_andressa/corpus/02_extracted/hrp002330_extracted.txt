I'm not really sad about never having kissed a guy necessarily. I've had an opportunity or two where I could've had my first kiss. But I chose not to. And given how those situations with these men turned out, it was for the best.

You see, she and I have known each other since high school. We were both really introverted. We still are. She made out made out with a guy or two in college. A year and a half ago, she had this huge crush on her coworker. this guy was going to leave his job soon to start grad school halfway across the country. And, she ended up losing her virginity to him. She spent the majority of that summer extremely depressed and heartbroken. She told me how she couldn't drink matcha lattes anymore because she was reminded of him. 

She's gotten into this really unfortunate habit of reminding me every other hangout about it. Saying stuff like "we should go to a bar/club/Halloween party so you can finally have your first kiss." For me, I take it as an insult. Because she's framing my lack of experience like it's a terrible thing. Like I shouldn't have had standards. Like she wants to remind me that nobody has ever wanted me like that before.
