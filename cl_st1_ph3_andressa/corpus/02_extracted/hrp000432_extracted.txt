Ironically we think we have control over things; once I make friends, enter a relationship,....
Then I will be happy and find meaning...

We fall for false hopes that repeatedly fail to live up to their promise 


Through this we are perpetually disappointed 
Untill one day we raise our hands declaring ourselves helpless...



So what to do now ? 
How to not be defined by our characteristics.
