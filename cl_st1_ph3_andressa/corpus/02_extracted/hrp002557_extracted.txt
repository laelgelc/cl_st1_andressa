Every single friend has left me. I have no one

I (22f) have lost 4 of my closest friends within a 1 year period. I don’t understand how it all happened since I’ve always cared for them all so deeply. Two of them requested I seek therapy in our final conversations.

It hurts because I’ve always valued friendships so heavily. I was always planning sleepovers and fun hangout ideas. I always wanted to spend more time with them and speak with them more. Now I’m alone.

All four of them ended it almost abruptly and via text, even though I requested to discuss it with them in person or over the phone. It hurts because even though I feel like I was heavily disrespected in these situations, I’d still accept them into my life with open arms if they reached out. I feel like a fucking dog. 

I think about how much of myself I showed to these people and how well they knew me. The fact that they all decided their lives were better without me in it is so  heartbreaking.
