(F24)I’m afraid of relationships, both romantic and platonic because everyone I’ve acquired in my space leaves. I’m not a bad person, I just have too much trauma and lack of social skills, but I do have some ways about me that could be considered bad or annoying. One being I can be a a random liar when I’m talking to people because I get so nervous during conversation not knowing if what I’m saying is normal.

I go day to day not talking, though I started college again recently and it’s so strange being surrounded by people have no intentions with because it feels like I’m holding off from a potential relationship that may hurt me. When I’m in class I can buy by dissociating from everyone being in the room, as if it’s just me and the professor. A guy tried to get my number literally the first day, and I got depressed on the way home because I gave it to him out of fear of making it awkward. 

The only people I talk to is my therapist, which is once a week and honestly I can tell she’s completely mentally separated from her job and doesn’t attempt to seem like she cares, she could at least learn some acting skills…sometimes she randomly sighs during my appointment very loud as if she’s acting getting stressed out about everything I tell her or I’m so boring and strange she hates being in my vicinity. I’ve recently just been really content with the idea of disappearing.

Btw If you’re gonna message me with intentions of a sexual convo…do not please.
