I’m 21 and I have no family and the friends I have never include me or just don’t care about me. What should I do? For years I have struggled without family nor friends, it’s just me. If I’m being honest I don’t even like myself… I’m so alone. Just living hurts but then if I did anything to myself no one would care because there’s no one to care. Is there anyone out there that’s in a similar situation? I need to know I’m not alone. The desperation I have to find connections has led me to some dark and scary situations, so now I’ve just given up on trying to find someone to connect with. No one seems to understand me at all because of it.
