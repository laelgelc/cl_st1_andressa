I take pottery classes to meet people and learn a new skill. I’ve finally figured out a good routine where I can complete all the tasks that need completing, and get home cooked meals in the fridge. I’m restarting my spiritual journey. And though all this has improved my mental health immensely, I’m still lonely. Dating is rough and I’m not even picky, I just want someone with similar values who can communicate well and will treat me right. Dating is scary because it means I have to be vulnerable and idk how I can allow that. Maybe I should I go to therapy.

I know I’m not the only one experiencing this, I just really wish this was easier. I don’t want to be alone but the mortifying ordeal of being known is also terrifying.

Edit: fifteen minutes ago my sister called me sobbing in tears saying she broke up with her boyfriend. It was a really ugly situation and I’m trying to be a supportive sister but dang it is hard when I’m feeling this way
