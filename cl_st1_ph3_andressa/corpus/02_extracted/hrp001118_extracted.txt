I’m going through a really rough phase in life right now — honestly feels like everything is falling apart at once. The loneliness is what hurts the most.

I’m not here looking for sympathy, just connection. I’ve tried talking to people online, but most disappear after a day or two, and that makes things feel even heavier.

If you’re someone who likes real conversations and doesn’t ghost, I’d really appreciate talking. Even small conversations can make things feel a bit lighter.
