I’m always the last person invited. I’m always cut off mid sentence. No one ever thinks about my feelings.I’m always worried about other people’s well-being, but no one even checks on me… I’ve come accustomed to being alone so much so that when I interact with people, I am so awkward it’s embarrassing. Being 25 with no friends, family or hope is soul crushing. 

Any advice?
