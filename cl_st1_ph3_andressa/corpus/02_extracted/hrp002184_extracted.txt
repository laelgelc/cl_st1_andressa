I’m 27F. Housebound agoraphobic, eating disorder and anxiety disorder. I use Facebook, X and Instagram (and reddit). But every time I log onto Instagram wow… it sends me down a path of spiraling depression and crashes my self esteem. I feel so bad but seeing people my age living and having fun, going to restaurants, cafes, going to the beach and on vacation made me feel so awful and that makes me feel like I’m a bad person because of course I want everyone to live and have fun and I’m so happy they are yet it makes me sad that I can’t be normal like them and do those things.
