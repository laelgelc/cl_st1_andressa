I have realised that most of the long lasting relationships work as a result of humour and lightedness.

I am a kind, smart and your typical nerdy guy but I'm really struggling to make connections with people in general. Whatever friends I have are born out of emotional support or intellectual mutualism.

I had relationships but I feel like I was too boring or i was too stuck up in my head.

I recently discovered that humour can really work a lot on everyone, and can even make women fall for you. I live in my head and am a really serious person with ambitions and goals i have immersed myself in. My humour hasnt been really great for the past 23 yrs and I don't know if I can improve it at all.

I can try to fake humour for a very short while but it drains my energy quickly and I don't know how to be impulsively funny.

Should I accept myself the way I am? Or Should I try to become more funny? If so how?
