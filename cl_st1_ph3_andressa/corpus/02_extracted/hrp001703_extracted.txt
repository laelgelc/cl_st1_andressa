I dont fit... anywhere. I don't make a difference... to anyone. i float through life, like a ghost. People I care about forget I even exist. The people who do talk to me, do it out of pity. I just... want to be real. I want to belong. I want to have a home. I want to feel safe. I want... about a thousand things I know I can never have. and it hurts. so, so badly.
