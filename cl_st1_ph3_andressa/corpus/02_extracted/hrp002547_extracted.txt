Just up at midnight can’t sleep feeling lonely as ever, I have a loving family and a few friends but between the depression and social anxiety I haven’t been getting out at all the past few months, the last girl who was interested in me was a few months ago, but I wasn’t ready for a relationship and she was, so we don’t talk anymore. I feel like I deserve to be lonely, I feel I am a burden on people who come into my life and would feel bad starting a relationship. Why would I want to burden someone I care about with my shitty little problems. At the same time it just hurts always being alone, I wish I just wasn’t a fuck up and could have the normal lives my friends are having, I feel empty and sad, but I can’t cry. I have no one to share these feelings with so Reddit will have to do.
