I (19F) live in a small town, there is nothing here but a few shops. There is nowhere to meet people or talk to people. It’s annoying! I spend all day in my room doing creative writing, since I have amaxophobia (fear of driving because if a near crash I was in). So if you want a friend, or just to talk, please DM me…
