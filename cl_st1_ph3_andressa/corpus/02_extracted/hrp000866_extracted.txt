I am 41 years old, married +2 
I have no one to share or to talk with. I am just getting up in the morning. Working. Coming back home to sleep and that's it. 
I didn't had sex in about 10 months. We are talking. About logistics of the home but not more than that. 
I am lone provider, the entire weight of financial burden is on me. I feel like iam going out of my mind.
I don't know what to do. I don't want to cheat but I feel like I am slowly being erased from exitance. I am afraid for my children to grow up without a father if we get a divorce. 
I am getting addicted to porn and I dont know what to do. 
Never felt so alone in my life.
