Hey all. This may sound strange, but we have never been as emotionally disconnected as a species as we are now. Internet made our lives easier, but we are way more lonely than before. Most people don't have much friends, noone to
actually talk to (office colleagues don't count). I know this, and I can actually help you get out of your loneliness and make some friends for real. Hear me out.


We have built a random video and text chat platform called Vooz which can help you talk to anyone and befriend them. You can just hop into Vooz co, enter some hobbies or interests of yours and get matched with similar strangers right away. You can choose to video or text chat, whatever you are comfortable with. You can even add your fav persons to your friendlist to reconnect later. If you don't like someone, just skip them for the next user. There are a lot of group chatrooms too fyi.


This is not your typical Omegle or other chat site. We focused highly on making the chat experience the best out of all other platforms. The platform is AI moderated and permanently bans NSFW users. The matching is super fast, takes a few seconds to pair you with someone, all real people. You can also use the gender or location filters in case you want a more customised pairing.


Like we said, Vooz is not your average chat platform. We are live since a year now with 250k monthly users. We can honestly help you make genuine friends and beat that loneliness. You deserve better, you deserve Vooz!
