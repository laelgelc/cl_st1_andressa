Every day I wake up I feel like I lose a bit more of my sanity more than the last day, I can’t properly think anymore, I keep crying for no reason, I have hyper episodes, I keep getting insane anxiety where when I sit down I can’t stop my leg from moving or I can’t stop thinking, I feel like my brain will blow up and I need to scratch it, I get angry easily, I keep having visions of shooting myself and screaming while pulling my hair, I can’t control my emotions.

I jus need a friend that’ll tell me they love, let me vent, take care of me, AGAIN tell me they love me, reply fast, never ghost and always have my back no matter how fucked up of a person I get.
