I am F, in my 30s and I only had one relationship ever, and it was a bad one, which lasted 6 years.   
But I have absolutely no one, no family, no friends, I am completely alone. I miss having any sort of social life, but especially love life. I hear constantly from men who say how easy women have it to get some guy and that it would be so easy to just go out to have fun and all that. No, it is not. I miss the touch of a man too. I mean, I dont even get a hug or something, how would I if I have no one?   
But even if I try to go out, no one seems to be really interested in me either, which I understand, I am not that interesting. But every night I go to sleep now, thinking, if I fall asleep, at least I am not lonely in my dreams, mostly I dream about my family life when I was little though.
