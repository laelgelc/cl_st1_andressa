I had a look at all of the commets etc. On this and I feel like people need help. I have a problem and it's consuming my life. I don't go outside, I don't have many friends, I only talk to one of them. I sleep like 4 or something hours a day with a disease or something involving my skin. I hide in my room everyday since I graduated and all of my friends etc, have jobs or they do something productive. And saying be positive about all that basically you are talking to a wall. Intructions and results. I know that getting out and about will cure that as well as a job etc. I'm just a loner and need instructions once something 'good' happens. Maybe it's just my mental thinking?

A comment would be appreciated and a kinda decent convo
