I've hit that point in my life where I realized that i am lonely. No close friends . i have like two online friends and that's really it. I miss having real life friends so bad. I miss going out and hanging out at someone's place until curfew. 

I graduated with no one by my side and watched who I thought were my friends take pictures without me. Im 18 and ive just given up. I knew these people for years but I guess everything changes after graduation. They view my stories on other platforms but don't text me. When I view their stories their always hanging out with each other and it's just a constant reminder that i was so easy to discard. I just stay inside all day imagining my own friend group.I'm so fucking cooked ​​
