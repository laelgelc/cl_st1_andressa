I can't seem to get anyone to talk to me. My snapchat is always empty , I try to talk to people but no one wants to talk to me. I live with three of my friends and they even seem to be getting distant. All I do and live for is work now , I dont have anything else to do but that. I just want to understand why. This is about romance too no matter what I cant seem to talk to anyone, im honestly not that bad looking and im polite and try to find common interests, but i guess im not intriguing enough. Im not really sure. Its starting to affect my mental health. I dont know whats wrong with me..
