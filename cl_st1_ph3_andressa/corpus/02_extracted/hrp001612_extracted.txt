ive been like this my entire life, i have friends at school, my family is broken but not too bad, i have a brother, but i just dont feel connected to anyone, its like im a freak to them, not normal enough to be taken seriously, i try to talk to my friends but theyre so immature, it feels like talking to 11 year olds, idk what to do, im really fucking lonely all the time and its getting to me
