Well, at least I have no one who I really connect with. Most of the time, it feels like I'm trying to pander to other people to make sure THEY have a good time. 

However, I wish I could have one friend I could relax with and we put an equal amount of energy with each other. It would be even better if this friend is someone who put me as their number one best friend and I'd do the same for them too. I want someone who can resonate with this loneliness and pain because somehow that'd make me feel less lonely...

God, I'm super tired doing everything by myself for myself. All I want is someone to get it, accept it, and be there for me while I put that energy back for them too. And, I swear I can't hang out with another introvert—I really wish I had someone who wanted to get OUT there and have fun. I love to stay indoors too but surely there are other ambiverts too.
