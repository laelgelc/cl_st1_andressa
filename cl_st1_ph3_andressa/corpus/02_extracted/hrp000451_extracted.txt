I feel like everyone has a life and genuinely are doing a lot of things except me. As someone who’s constantly sick, i have accepted that i will not lead a normal life but everyone is moving academically and genuinely going out with friends and having fun at places while i am just there .

I did a lot of things to stop the feeling or just try to do the same but whenever i get out it was alone and it didn’t feel the same because every time i open a story all i see is people genuinely making memories and having fun including my ex classmates, ex friends . If i say it doesn’t hurt me , i am lying. It hurts so bad that everyone genuinely has a life and mine on pause . They live romantic relationships, friendships and a lot of things teens do .

That is unfair they lived their life to the fullest have memories with people and is making one while i am just there now 20 years old and can’t even tell one experience i have had in my teens, not friend groups, no romantic relationship. Nothing. Just years of depression, anxiety and chronic illnesses . Every-time i try to make things better , i just end up sick and hospitalized. I just have absolutely no life and nothing . What should i genuinely do to get out of this when it has been years since i was a child? I feel like this hell is never going to end and i am just living to suffer 💔
