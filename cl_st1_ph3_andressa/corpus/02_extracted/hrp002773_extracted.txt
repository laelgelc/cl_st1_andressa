About myself:

I currently live in a small town in North Dakota. I make a decent salary and live pretty comfortable in my two bedroom apartment. Outside of family and co-workers during the 9-5 shift, I do not really talk to anyone. After work, I go to the gym and then come back home to make dinner. Usually end the night by watching a movie or television show. On the weekends, I bring my bike out to a local trail and usually catch the newest release in the theaters.

Is there anything wrong with my lifestyle? My parents are concerned for me, but I am happy. I like having my own space and doing my own things. I have tried dating a few times, but I just prefer to be alone. I am an introvert also so it is quite exhausting to go out.
