Some people on here complain about the same things on a daily basis.

When others offer advice and/or want to engage in a conversation to talk about the issues OP has posted about, the OP ignores them. The only comments the OP reacts to are the ones who full of pity.

I'm really sorry for everyone who feels lonely and disconnected, but turning in endless circles and leaping up pity from others is not helpful at all.
