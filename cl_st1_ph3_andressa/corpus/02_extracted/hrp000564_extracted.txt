I’ve been debating writing this because i didn’t want to burden calling my friends with my feelings. It feels like the last few years have come crashing down on me. In my most private moments are where I really feel the loneliness. I’ve been living on my own for a couple of months now, it’s left me with an enormous amount of time to be in my head and think about so much. I don’t mean to be vague so I’ll just say I’ve screwed up a lot of friendships and 2 relationships these past few years. It’s been a year of discovery and realization that’s made me very sick and angry with myself. Even though I know my mistakes don’t define me, it’s been hard to face the consequences.
And I feel like the ultimate consequence is this constant feeling that I’ve been left alone. 

As far as those friendships go, I’ve been told by said friends it’s not something I couldn’t come back from and I’ve since done work to get back in their good graces. But I can’t shake the feelings that our relationships are irrevocably changed and won’t ever be the same. And it’s really hard. I’m awful with change and have never been able to deal with it good. I try to reach out and give myself non-negotiables to avoid disappearing completely but I know the older we get the harder it can be to maintain relationships due to work, family, etc. 

Maybe I’m just a wuss who needs to face the music and get over myself. It’s just hard to manage the loneliness that comes as a result of the decisions I’ve made. I’m not in a position financially for therapy yet. I just really miss the consistency with this group of friends and the closeness that came with it. It made life feel less lonely and I’m always going to be angry I screwed that up. 

TLDR: the loneliness is getting to me as a result of my actions but I’m trying to accept this reality
