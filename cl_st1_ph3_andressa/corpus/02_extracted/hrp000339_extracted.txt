Ive came to the conclusion that I just wanted to make friends so bad that I took on so many different hobbies and activities(including substance abuse) just so that I could have/make friends. Now I look around, a sober man, but a heavy lonely heart. Those friends I did have seemed to just walk away one by one, but I still have these relics full of memories, some fun, some painful. I don’t have a single friend. I feel so alone in this world. And now, im afraid to make a friend.
