I’m a second year uni student who goes to school far from home so I don’t have any of my childhood friends. I’ve always been a very social person but a bit introverted like I love being around others but I can find it hard to start a relationship with new people. That said, school has been hard for me as I’ve really only got two good friends. I used to have a few more but two of my roommates have decided that they don’t want to associate with me at all anymore and spend all their time together locked in a room, which is not helping combat my feelings. I guess I just want to know how people fight their feelings of loneliness?
