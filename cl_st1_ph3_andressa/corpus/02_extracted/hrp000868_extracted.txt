26 years old, and not once has love looked back at me the way I look at it. Since childhood, whenever I found myself drawn to someone, she was already walking beside someone else. It feels like I was born to stand in the background, watching others live the moments I can only dream of.

My life has always been football, the gym, and now coding lines into a screen as a software developer. On paper, it looks like I’m building something, moving forward. But inside, it feels empty. Because every time my heart beats a little faster for someone, it ends in silence. They don’t see me not really.

Maybe it’s me. Maybe I don’t know how to speak, how to connect, how to stand in front of someone without being invisible. And the worst part is, I can’t even tell if it’s bad luck, my flaws, or some invisible curse wrapped around my name.

I try to laugh, I try to stay strong, but the truth is… there’s a different kind of loneliness when you’ve *never* been chosen. People talk about heartbreak like it’s when love leaves you but what about those of us who never even get the chance to break?

Sometimes I wonder if anyone will ever look at me the way I’ve spent my whole life looking at others. Or if I’m just meant to be the story nobody remembers the one who was always there, but never loved.
