**The Weight of Loneliness Amidst Joy**

The laughter in the room is far too loud,

A hollow ringing in a happy crowd.

I watch them toast to houses, rings, and heirs,

While I sit drowning in my own despairs.

It’s not just that I’m standing here alone,

It’s that I have no life to call my own.

No wife to greet me when the porch light glows,

No girl to love, and god, the envy grows.

**Envy and the Stagnation of Life**

I see them move in rhythms, two by two,

Progressing in a way I’ll never do.

They build their futures, solid, stone by stone,

While I just rot within this crowded zone.

I care for them—or try to—but the bite

Of coming home to silence every night

Makes every "congrats" feel like a lie.

I’m tired of watching life just pass me by.
