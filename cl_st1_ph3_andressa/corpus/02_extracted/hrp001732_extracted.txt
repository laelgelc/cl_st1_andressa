For me so far it's not using social media like X, Tik Tok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitch, etc. I'm trying to cut out of using FaceBook except when I need to sell something, but I still use Reddit to help myself not feel alone and I use YouTube for entertainment.  I also have a pet cat who helps me from feeling too lonely most days too.
