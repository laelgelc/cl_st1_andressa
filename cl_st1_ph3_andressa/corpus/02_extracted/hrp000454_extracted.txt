I'm 24, always lived with either family members, a partner or a roommate. Next year, I'll be moving by myself for the first time ever and I'm terrified. I'm doing this because of a falling out with my current roommate and the realisation that I need to learn to be okay with my own company/depend on myself because I have really bad codependency issues among other things.

I'm just so depressed at the idea of coming home to no one, and I don't have friends so it's not like I have any kind of social life to compensate, just family.  I wanted to ask does anyone here have tips/advice or general thought on how to go through this experience?
