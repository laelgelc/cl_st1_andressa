I have a friend who spends a lot of time alone at home by herself.  We just started scheming about ways that she could feel less alone because she would periodically share with me via text.  I would then text her back when I got the chance.  But, I'm guessing what I have to say in my reply would tend to be more of just an acknowledgment than something more substantial.  Not sure yet.  What have people tried along these lines?  What are some factors that make you feel more or less connected to the person supporting you when doing something like this?
