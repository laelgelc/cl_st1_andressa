I'm 15 and my mom got arrested yesterday, me and her had a special kind of relationship, we were like best friends, never lied to each other, always talked to each other, always cracked stupid jokes and we would dream of ridiculous fantasys, she raised me when my dad was drunk, she believed in me when my dad didn't, and now she's gone, I have friends at school but it's not the same, I can't go to them when I'm crying, I can't go to them when I'm lonely, I'm not sure I'll stay sane enough to see the day she gets out, I just wish I had someone else who I could go to like that.
