I 26m have always been a pretty closed off person. I never wanted my friends to know that my mom was pretty unstable mentally growing up having to deal with  being cheated on, went through a divorce, losing her father, and having 3 kids only 1 year a part from each other, and our home burning down all within 5 years of each other. I was also always called overly sensitive as a kid so I learned to knock that shit off or get made fun of at home for showing too much emotion. So my friends know nothing about my home life and my family knows nothing about my life outside of the family dynamic. 

But now I'm genuinely really tired of nobody knowing much about me. It's especially tiring during arguments. Everyone thinks they're my only problem but I have so much going on that I never tell anyone. It's my fault for not sharing but I just don't want people to look at me differently. And now I just feel incredibly isolated. I wish that I could share my story with people but I don't trust anyone anymore. I've tried to reach out a few times and everyone just kinda looks at me like I'm joking because I'm perceived to be such a strong and stoic person. Or maybe they just didn't care which could be possible. 

I have new friends this year and they're actually very kind. I've never had friends like this but I don't want to open up and make them uncomfortable like some of my other friends. So I continue to keep my mouth shut. But I'm getting really tired and some really bad thoughts are starting to be a bit too appealing. Not sure what to do but I feel like I'm running out of time
