I'm sure of most us here atleast yearn for someone who would care for them, ride through the ups and downs with them, unfortunately most of the time it's deep rooted to the loneliness we suffer but as we're yearning for such connection, my personal and rational mind tells me what I or we even have to offer them?, the aforesaid current state may not enough as it'll eventually become a shared sorrow and for someone who's been yearning and has suffered enough to the point he has no spark left how come he expects someone to eradicate his gloom because as much as we want to relieve our sorrow I wouldn't want them to suffer because of me and I would always want the best for them and care for them If it means even for the littlest spark I could give, I may be too pessimistic or even couldn't express myself clearly here for which I apologise but if someone actually got what I'm trying to say I appreciate you. Also it's My first post here.
