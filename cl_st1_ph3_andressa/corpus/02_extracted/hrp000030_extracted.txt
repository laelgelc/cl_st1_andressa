For some reason I am feeling very lonely today. I’ve never been the type to have a big group of friends and I struggle to trust and open up to people. Right now my only social life is at work because I am there majority of the time. I’m able to have conversations but the “friends ships” never leave work. I also don’t get to see my boyfriend much, maybe once a week. We work opposite schedules and I also have kids who he hasn’t met yet( we’re planning to make that happen soon). We both talk and FaceTime as much as we can. Either way I just wish I had friends to talk to, meet up with and hang out with. During the time of this pandemic I’ve felt so stuck yet unmotivated to take steps forward in my career, life etc. I am most likely moving to a new state next year so I don’t want to start any major moves in my life when I’ll be leaving the life I have here soon. Any advice? Feeling particularly lonely today 🥺
