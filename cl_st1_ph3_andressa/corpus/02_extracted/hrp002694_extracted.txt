Let's start by saying that this is not dating advice.

You deserve to be loved, you are a rare pokemon and your master will only catch you if you're at your best condition. The chances of meeting a dope person increase when you're at your best condition and when you know what you want. (Wrote down a list of the things you're looking for on a person and try to give off that vibe) The strongest, most beautiful, most creative, not needy version of yourself will not only attract the girl/boy/👽 you like, INSTEAD, it will attract the one you need, obviously you don't have to marry the first person you come up with; but trust me, things get a lot easier when you're at the right place doing your own thing without rushing things with normies.
