experiencing this "culture" is repulsive. nothing that other people find value in is valuable to me. I cannot respect the value systems that I encounter in other people. no one is relatable in any meaningful way. socializing with people is one of the most horrible experiences in life because people are pitifully stupid, incoherent, and selfish. all I wanted to do is work together with people to create healthy environments outside of the destructive lifestyle that surround me but I get treated like a criminal for it. I'm done "putting myself out there". people are unworthy of life, because they prioritize feelings over truth. 

there is no goal remaining at all.
