no one notices when I'm around or not it's always "oh you scared me" or "didn't know you where here" most the time and at family stuff no one talks to me. no on some say hi but who wants and sit with the quiet emo lesbian person in the corner and at school most the times when I skip days no one seems to care and if they care it's because they where alone and need someone to fill up that void but when iam no one comes talkin to me. most the time I'm talking to myself out loud and I ruined a perfectly good relationship because I'm dumb as fuck and didn't know how to tell her my feelings so I'm back in the same alone headspace and I hate how I can't be happy with out smoking and not thinking about anything bad why am I such a sad nobody
