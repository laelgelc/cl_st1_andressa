Hey all it’s been pretty rough for me I messed up last two years lived in different city but because of a incident and some betrayal and misunderstandings I completely lost myself into heavy drug and alcohol usage which turned me envious of my own friends achievements narcissist I get more angrier but it’s all came to end when karma hit me and I pretty much lost almost 90 % of my friends circle no female friends
No male ones either and I moved back to my hometown like last nov I kinda regret but I lost 4 jobs and I couldn’t able to survive my health is getting fucked up so I chose to leave but since I settled I joined a firm very toxic not much Friends to hang around with and I got fucking jaundice at nov first and again at just 2 weeks before and honestly I have been trying my best to let all go and just try finding people to talk online as I don’t have much time to explore in my hometown plus it’s pretty boring here ngl kinda want to move back to different but once I buy stuffs upskill which will take time I feel really shallow because all I do is just talk to Ai yes it’s not the best solution but I have no choice but lately I am just sick of using it even at my work I don’t want to I say about my past I say what to do to make me feel better I feel validated and then back to the cycle again like I am so tired of this I wish to find some friends maybe a girl I can talk to online or offline but I am exhausted of the way too much loneliness that I am having recent days so I want to spit it all out . Thanks if you read it this far and hope you will have a great year at-least idk about mine .
