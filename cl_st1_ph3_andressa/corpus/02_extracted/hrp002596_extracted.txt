One reason I’m alone is because I’ve always felt like a punching bag, That or I’ve always felt invisible. Growing up no one taught me how to act, and I’d just get frustrated and lash out. Would act like the weird kid in class and I mistook the kids picking on me as acceptance. Not only that but I was always the weird kid and kept doing weird things because it gave me attention. Now that I’m older and living on my own, I regret that and don’t know who I am anymore. No hobbies or interests really, because I would bend my tastes to other peoples tastes just to be liked but that didn’t work so I just isolate and regret. I don’t know who I am or how to start to know who I am, I don’t know how to talk to people because of that and past trauma with bullying. Do I go out and try or just feel safe in my imagination? Idk. Hoping someone gets it lmao
