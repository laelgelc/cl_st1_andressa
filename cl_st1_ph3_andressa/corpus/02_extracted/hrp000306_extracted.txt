I 16 F have horrible relationships with my parents, we just got into a fight. Physical and verbal all the jazz. The worst feeling about all of this is crying alone in the bathtub going through my phone contacts trying to find who I can talk to and there is no one I am able to. In that moment I want my parents but they r not good people. Feeling alone is worse than the fight I have with them
