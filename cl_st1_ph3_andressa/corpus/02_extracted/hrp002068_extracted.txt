I'm currently in grade 10 turning 16 this year.Me and my girlfriend of one year recently broke up.Now I just feel alone.I don't really have friends since I all my time with my girlfriend.It just feels like no one cares anymore and I have no one to talk to that could really understand how I feel and try to give me advice.I know I'm still young and probably overreacting but I don't want to suffer alone anymore and throw away my life.I have started focusing more on my school work and hobbies and have been trying to improve myself,it just feels like something is missing.I need friends who I can talk to and vent to.I also am a really good listener and give good advice.What should I do?
