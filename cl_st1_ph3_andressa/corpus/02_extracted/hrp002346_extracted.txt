hi everyone

i honestly don't know who to talk to anymore, mostly because i don't have anyone to talk to, so i'm posting here.

i just started college this past fall and honestly, it's been pretty hard. i had trouble adjusting to school as i am pretty far from home, and on top of that, i cut ties with the 2 friends that came to the same school as me. somehow, i have managed to not make a single friend in 6 months. it feels like whenever i try to talk to someone, they are disgusted by me. i have tried to apply to social organizations on campus to try and make friends, but i have been rejected by every single one. on top of this, it seems like my roommate goes out every single day. i honestly don't know what to do anymore. i got accepted into one pre-professional organization, and i joined the mentorship program. the goal of this program is to make it easier for freshmen to adjust, but we have literally only met up twice, and once was at a dance hall where we could barely talk over the music. 

this semester i made a vow to myself to leave my dorm more, but i just don't know where to go. i feel embarrassed because everyone has their group, and i sit alone in hidden corners. we have had school cancelled for 2 days in a row now because of dangerous weather, and i have not left my room since saturday evening. my roomate tried to invite me to go out, but i didn't want to go somewhere i wasn't wanted. 

i feel so alone, which is not what i thought would happen on a campus of over 40,000 people.
