When you know them better than anyone else, and they know you better than anyone else.  

Where there's no place left for doubt that you're each other's most important person.  

And you would instinctively search for their presence when things go wrong, when things go well, when things shift in any direction, and you need an ear to listen to you. To really listen, and to really understand, because they understand you.  

Maybe I'm over romanticizing this feeling and that's why I crave it so much. Because it's unrealistic.  
Or maybe it's a completely realistic expectation and my unsatisfied yearning is justified.  

But it looks so far away, and so unattainable.  
And when the hope is crushed - to be someone to someone - getting out of bed just gets that heavier.  

Maybe I shouldn't put so much of my well-being onto something I can't control. But I can't quite this ache in me.  

I want to be someone to someone.
