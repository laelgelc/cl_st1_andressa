Like during the week, I work and do other stuff so I’m typically busy. Then I look up and realize it’s the weekend and I’m supposed to be doing something different. I’m supposed to be having fun and sure I have hobbies. I can have fun alone. But I’m alone all the time. And then I realize my roommates are out, almost everyone I know is posting about their parties and game nights and girls nights and concerts. 

Meanwhile I can’t even find an event to go to because I don’t want to be out a night alone. And I don’t have anyone to ask. Or anyone to chat with. Or even a virtual hang. 

It utterly hurts sometimes.
