I’m 17, so my feelings are probably going to change in not even a month, but I feel alone. I have a good family, and a few friends I can talk too. But nothing crazy. I get that’s more than a lot of people, but I don’t feel like I have anyone to share things with. I want a partner. I want close friends. And I know that takes time, I just feel like I’m waiting for that to happen. To meet the right people. I want the ability to go out and be the one creating situations where I can make friends. Where I can ask people out. I just want to skip to being 18. I want so much more than what I have. I guess it’s kind of normal for humans though; to want more than you have. Idk. If anyone has any advice on what I can do in the meantime to create a social life and not mentally explode, I’d appreciate it.
