Never held a conversation when i worked. Can't get a reply on any social app or friend making space. Spent the last 4 hours scrolling desperately hoping to find somewhere i can contribute but always feeling inadequate. When I do message, when i do pluck up the courage i get nothing in response. 

Please someone tell me this is just loneliness not just autism as an adult?
