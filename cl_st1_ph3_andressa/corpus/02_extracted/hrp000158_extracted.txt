Hello everyone, in all aspects of my life I feel loneliness from time to time. If its friends, work, family or even just when I am with my dog I have that deep ache at the base of my stomach that connects to being alone. Because of this for my major work at school my topic is loneliness. I feel that i can connect to you and understand each other well with feeling the same thing. These are a few questions that you could answer that could help me even understand myself better.
