17 F, I know I have not lived a long life but since first grade I feel like I have been like the complete opposite of a magnet with people. Everyone around me, people in my class, people in my school, my family members all have friends that they have a good connection with, talk about, hang out with. 

School is awkward, people will ignore me, avoid eye contact, nobody wants me in their group project, I feel like nobody tolerates me not even the teachers. Back home I have no plans or messages. I want nothing more than to just have someone that wants to interact and do things with me, but I feel like if nobody ever wanted me or showed a single sign then I shouldn’t bother trying?
