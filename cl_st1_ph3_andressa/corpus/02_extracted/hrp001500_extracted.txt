First of all, I want to express care for anyone struggling with loneliness. I know there's no simple solution and it can feel so heavy to stay hopeful.

And, as someone who's struggled with loneliness in the past and have made tremendous progress, I want to encourage folks to consider taking a more structured approach to building connection. By that I mean, learning and practicing basic skills like

* Identifying feelings/needs
* Self-regulation
* Empathic listening
* Authentic expression
* Repairing rupture
* Conflict resolution

Having competency in skills have greatly increased my confidence in relationships as well as helped me identify who are the types of people most aligned with my values and are equally ready to invest.

I'm just starting my YouTube channel and am still finding my voice in all of this. Would love any feedback.

Hope this is helpful!
