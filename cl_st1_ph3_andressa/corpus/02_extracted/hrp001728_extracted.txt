I'm 24 now and I'm worried if this will go on for another 10 years. I have my cat with me at least, such a sweet boy. I really need to find a friend group who I connect with, a support system I feel like I'm part of and I can be myself. However, why is it IMPOSSIBLE to find? 

I swear my luck is horrible because I hear other success stories and I question how? I thought I did everything right. It is so, so frustrating.
