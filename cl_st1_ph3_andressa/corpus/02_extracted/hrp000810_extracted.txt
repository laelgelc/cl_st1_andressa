M29 was in a relationship with f26 for 3 years things were toxic. I cut everyone off, got rid of all social media and accounts or she deleted them or removed my access. Now its been a week i moved on and just built the courage to run and god damn... do i feel alone. I feel as if ive been cut off from everything and its uncomfortable to be in public even.
