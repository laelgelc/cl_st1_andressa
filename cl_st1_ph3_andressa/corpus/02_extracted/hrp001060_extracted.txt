I'm so fucking tired of being alone. I am 22(NonBinary) and I really don't have anyone. I know it's my fault because I don't try, but I can't try because I currently still live with my homophobic parents and I can't really go out (like I couldn't go to a bar by myself without my parents coming. I'd love to go to a LGBTQ bar in a bigger city near by, but my parents would be on my ass about it). It fucking hurts. It hurts when people say they care about me and they can "relate" to me, but when I get to know them, they do a complete 180 and act like total assholes and are negative all the fucking time. I wish I could be with someone who genuinely understood me and I could wake up not feeling like absolutely useless. I just want a friend that I can hug and hold them. And all I can do is be an observer. I will never get to experience it.
