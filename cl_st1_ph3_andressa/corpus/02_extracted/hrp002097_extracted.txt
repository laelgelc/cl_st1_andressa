I'm currently trying my best to surround myself with people, but no matter how many people's lives I touch, I still feel profoundly lonely. Even when people speak and involve me, no matter what, I feel like the 5th wheel. Like I am just intruding. 

  
I did bar service at a queer place today, I tried so hard with my outfit and style, I smile at everyone and try my very best, but no speaks to me unless I speak to them. 



Late during the night they told me "You don't have to power through the entire night, you can take a break." I refused, played tough, but really the truth is, what else would I do if not work? I have literally no friends here. 

  
Sorry for the whiny post. I was recently told I should not do that anymore, be so whiny I mean. But maybe on this subreddit it's okay?

  
I'm just not a cool butch girl, I'm a clingy lonely weirdo who's trying too hard.
