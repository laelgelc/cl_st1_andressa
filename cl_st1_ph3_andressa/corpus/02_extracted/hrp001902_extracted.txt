I really try not to be a hater and envious but seeing all my friends and colleagues get married , happy relationships affects me so much bc it’s like what’s wrong with me????? And when I vent people say “love yourself” like I love myself a lot that’s not why I feel how I feel. It’s just so hard to describe
