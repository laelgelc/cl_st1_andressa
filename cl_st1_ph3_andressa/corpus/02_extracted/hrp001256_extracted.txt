In the past two years I’ve really grown as a person and have lost friends along the way. Little back story i had a big group of friends who i was close with but due to owning my own business and work getting busy i had fallen off with going out for a bit. I tried to do an outing with them and was pretty much told “why would we want to go out when you haven’t hung out with us in weeks”. That hurt as they were very close friends ( to me) but nothing i could do at that point.

At work everyone goes out and I’m just excluded from most outings. I really don’t know what I’ve done to make them not like me. At this point idk if it really is a me issue. I thought i was a good friend and always down to do something. So i have no friends at this point and it does get tiring doing things alone most of the time. Looking for advice and if anyone has ideas on how to make friends nowadays
