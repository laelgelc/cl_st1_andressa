(M24) (context: Indian. Here at least biys live with their parent even after marriage) 
Whenever I envision my future I don't see my parents in them. Currently I'm living in another state. My home state doesn't have that many companies hence getting a decent corporate job is a challenge. Now that I'm on my own feet and my parents are retired they want me to get a job in my home state where career progression is tough. I don't intend going back. 
Also I don't have anything to talk with them. Growing up theywereb busy with their job. Also in my high school I lashed out at my father, which kinda ruined our relationship for some time. Until time healedmyr wounds. Cut to present I still don't have a good relation with them. father because he was a douchbag and mother because she is team dad. 
Here we are, I spent one whole week in my home and still spent most of my time alone in my room. I'm notinterestedi in fixing ties with my father. I just wear a fake mask of truce around him. I thought wherever I'll move next as part of my job switch I'll bring my parents with me so as to relieve the empty nest syndrome. But now I doubt. And they don't fit my lifestyle. When I was home she called me to tell me to be back at home before 9. Like wtf. As if I have work beyond 10 at night. (Client meetings)
