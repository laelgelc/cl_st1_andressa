Im 42 f and it feels like every year is more lonely than the last. Some days im strong but right now its overwhelming. I live off grid and separated from my child's father years ago due to abuse. My living situation is hard to keep up without a partner. I feel ugly and awkward most days. Ive isolated myself throughout the years and am torn between acceptance and depression.. I never thought id have so many regrets. Thanks for listening to my little vent.
