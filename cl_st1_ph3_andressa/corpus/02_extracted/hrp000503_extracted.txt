I'm so tired of myself. I had what I needed. I had everything I wanted, and I gave it up. I want to go back, but I know you can never do anything twice. Writing this is making me sick. It doesn't matter that I'm different now, I'm still a waste. Too old. Too much time has passed. Too little too late.
