I'm an Indian male 17 years of age. i don't use social media frequently i have some friends but i don't feel i have a connection with anyone nobody seems trustworthy. I feel if i tell them something they'll spread the word and ill just become a laughing stock and i have seen it happen. I go on runs in the mornings just to be alone . I feel as if my parents don't understand me even if i tell them i feel like i have no one to love or anyone to love me. I think a lot before i say anything and feel like I'm not being myself and pretending to be someone I'm not and I've been doing this for so long that i forgot who I am. I feel as if I'm a burden and better of alone. I've never been in a relationship even though i feel that would fix my problems and give me someone to confide in .I feel i wasted my life by not doing more. I feel like i don't belong where i am. Most people i know don't share the same interests as me so it is harder to connect with people. Doing self improvement feels like I'm trying to be someone I'm not its just become routine. Seeing other people connecting with each other make me feel like i have a problem. I feel i wont find a person who will truly understand me
