Since I haven't had any friends in a long time, whenever I have an idea or a question that's been bugging me the only way to get it out of my system is to share it on this app or some other social media. That's pretty much what I've been doing since I was 11.

However the thing with reddit is that you will always get some kind of criticism with pretty much every post you make, atleast one single commenter will disagree with you and they'll make sure to convey that disagreement harshly because unlike friends they don't really care about your feelings. And you can't really blame them, there are 8 billion people on this earth, obviously you only have space to value people you know. We are just unlucky that we don't have anyone that knows us.

I think I can tolerate some disagreements, but having hundreds of people attack you can feel bad even for someone resilient. A few centuries back, you must've done something absolutely disgusting to have so many people be against you. Now it's as simple as writing a vulnerable reddit post people end up misunderstanding. 

I think I'm tired of always arguing with people. I just wanna share my thoughts to an actual person instead of my notepad without having to always defend them
