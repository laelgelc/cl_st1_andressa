Making new friendships is hard, but keeping those friendships is even harder IMO. I would like say that realistically I am not that "lonely". I do have my family, partner I live with, and a solid amount of friends. However, many of my "OG" friendships have withered away over the years.

I am currently a 26 year old man. Many of my friends have been with me for 10+ years now. But lately it feels like I have to fight and beg for some kind of interaction with some of these friends. In one particular instance, my best friend from ages 15-21ish still doing the exact same thing we did during those years. We loved staying up late playing video games together just as most young people do these days. But the last few years he has stopped playing games with me, and is constantly playing other games with other people. I know this of course because of Steam and Disc-ord. I don't think it's wrong for me to view my friends list on steam or click on a server in disc and see that my "friend" is off playing games with other people. This really shouldn't bother me, other than the fact that he continues to tell me he is "very busy" and that we will "play sometime". When I do see him 1-2 times a year in person, it's like we never left. We chat it up and all is well.

So my question for all reading this is: What should you expect of your friends?

I know there are many variables such as how close you are to the friend (figuratively and literally), but I would like to get a sense of what people expect from their friends. How often should you expect to talk to them, hear back from them after reaching out, how often to get together in person, etc.

  
Thanks in advance!
