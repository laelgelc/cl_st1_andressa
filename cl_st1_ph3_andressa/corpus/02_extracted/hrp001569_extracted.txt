First time being stood up on a date, waited for 1 and a half hours without contact before going home. Went to talk to my best friend just to vent, and he, good, married, tall, awesome guy that he is, said he'd set me up with a new date. Gave me the number of a 17F. I am 26M, ffs.

I can't f**** deal with this. I'm starting to reconsider every friendship I ever had and I never felt more alone.
