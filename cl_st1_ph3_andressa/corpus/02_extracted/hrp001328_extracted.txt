Hello Reddit Community,
Im new here and i wanted to share something.
Ive lost all of my friends (i go still to school),
Because they gave me the feeling of being left out…
Its not just a feeling it happened really (like i was mostly behind them, i was not wrapped in their drama anymore) like they had their own drama and after a time i couldnt be more in the drama, because i had other problems (mental health, school) and they knew it.
After a time of being left out i began after school to cry cause i felt so lonely (i still feel).
I dont know if this decision was good or not i mean when i was with them i was hurt but now im hurt because i have no one, i have like other friends in school but i don’t have private contact to them.
Its draining for me i don’t know what to do, i first 
distanced me from them and then i broke the contact of, i think they are mad at me but they aren’t sorry for treating me like im air.
How to cope with this feeling, its hard, it feels like a hole in my chest.
