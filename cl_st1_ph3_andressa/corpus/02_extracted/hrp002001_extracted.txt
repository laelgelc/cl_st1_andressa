Sometimes I don’t feel like a real person

I see humans do human things that seem to come so naturally

I wonder if other people see that I’m not like them

I wonder if they feel unseen by me

I feel like I won’t “fill” any person up, like a snack before the real meal, the real deal.

Maybe I didn’t get enough practice being human growing up so I grew into this weird collection of processes and reflexes.
