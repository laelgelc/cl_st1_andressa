Hey everyone,
So I moved to a new city about 2 months ago for my online college. Since then, it’s just been… weird. I barely go out, mostly stay in my room all day. I don’t have any friends here, no gf, no one to talk to. The only time I step out is to eat at the mess or buy something small.

A week ago, I joined a gym thinking maybe I’d meet people there, but everyone already seems to have their own groups. They talk, laugh, hang out  and I’m just standing there, feeling like the odd one out. I try to smile or say hi, but it never goes anywhere.

Most days I just lie on my bed, scrolling through reels or watching YouTube for hours. Sometimes I feel this weird mix of anxiety and sadness  like I should be doing something with my life, but I just don’t know what. I can feel myself slowly getting more and more disconnected.

It’s not like I don't like being alone, but lately it’s starting to feel heavy. I overthink a lot, and some nights I honestly feel kind of depressed.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you deal with the loneliness or make friends when you were completely new somewhere? I’d really appreciate any advice or even just hearing your stories.
