Couple hours ago, I’ve seen the move „[Les Olympiades](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12708658/)“, and it sort of got to me. I know I must be careful about this kind of movies, because romance is my sensitive topic, and I guess I wasn’t, but the careful thing was not to watch it, but if I didn’t watch it, I wouldn’t know I shouldn’t watch it.  
Nora Ligier ([Noémie Merlant](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4374524/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_3_3)) reminded me of my last situationship girl. She kinda had similar facial expressions. And getting over the last situationship girl took years, and even now, after more than 5 years, it is still bit sensitive. And bonus point: Noémie Merlant was born at the same day as me. Literally, the same date. I wonder about the time of her birth, because that would decide who is older. I hope she is.  
I got out of the worst feelings, but I just feel really lonely now. It something I used to feel, but then…not. Because of the medication I’m taking.  
If it isn’t obvious, I have noone to talk to. Right now, I need either my therapist, super-close friend, or, ideally, the holy grail: GF. What will not help, is some shallow conversation with someone I don’t know and who doesn’t know me.  
So I’m just sitting here, in candle light, it is about 23:20:\_\_, and I should go continue to write in my jounrnal, then go to the bathroom and go to sleep. Because sleep will help.  
Today was not a good day. Just failure after failure.
