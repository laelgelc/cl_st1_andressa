Really don't know what to do. 
Nothing is fun anymore. 
All alone and lonely like always. 

First day after two weeks with a heavy cold and the worst headaches ever. 

Kinda chillin right now.  
Actually I don't feel really bad right now.  And I know exactly how that feels and how bad it can be. 

Maybe I'm going numb?
No motivation at all. 
I really don't care anymore. 
Just useless.  

Work, rotting, sleep.
And repeat.

I'm just in the moment right now.  

I am alone. 
Always was.
Always will be.
Pretty sure.
I would bet on it.

Would like to go on a road trip with u.  
Just right now.
No plans.
Just fuckin go.

U.
A person I love. 
Are u there?
Are u out there?
Anywhere?
Give me a smoke signal or something.

Only one time in my life I would like to love someone that loves me back.  
Even if it's just for a few hours.  

But u are hiding.
Somewhere.
Maybe you don't even exist.
Probably.

Why am I even here if it's not for u?
I need u.
I need u to be there.
I don't want to be here if I can't care for u.
Without u life is meaningless!

Where are u?
