It just came on so fast. I was thinking that my nephews were going home Sunday and I was suddenly so alone. So scared and desperately alone. Everyone is sleeping so I’m dealing with this by myself. I also was dumped a year ago 6 days from now. I’m just so fucking in it and I don’t want to be. I collect board games and my nephews are the only ones who play with me. I’m hitting the dating apps after the holidays. I need an autistic girlfriend who likes board games. Kinda over sharing now. Gonna try to sleep now.
