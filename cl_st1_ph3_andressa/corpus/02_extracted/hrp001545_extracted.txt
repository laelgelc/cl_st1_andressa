I’m a 30-year-old man working in the Delhi NCR area at a private company in Noida. I got married in December 2023, but the relationship collapsed within a month. My former wife soon filed several false accusations against me, and though the divorce was finalized this July, the whole process has left me financially, mentally, and physically shattered.

Paying for legal help and the Alimony settlement that I paid to my ex-wife, for a marriage that lasted not more then 17 days,  wiped out every bit of my savings, investments, and PF. I’m now in serious debt that will take nearly a decade to repay—almost half my current take-home salary goes into it. Most of the friends I thought I could rely on disappeared during this time. I guess my financial and emotional struggles made them distance themselves.

Even though the legal stress is over, the emotional scars remain. My phone is silent unless it’s work related. I made the mistake of opening up to some colleagues early on, and a few of them now mock my failed marriage—sometimes even using my ex-wife’s name just to tease me. I’ve tried to tell them to stop, but they don’t listen. I keep quiet because I can’t risk losing my job.

What hurts the most is the loneliness. There’s no one in my life who asks how I’m doing or how my day was. I live with my parents and have an elder brother, but we’ve never been emotionally close as a family. We don’t talk about our feelings. I feel like I’m becoming numb—questioning the point of my job and life in general.

I’ve attempted meditation, exercise, prayer, and other ways to heal, but I can’t stick to anything. I end up doom-scrolling for hours. Despite having 500+ contacts in my phone, there isn’t a single person I feel I can call to just break down and talk. No messages, no check-ins, nothing.

The loneliness is becoming unbearable.
