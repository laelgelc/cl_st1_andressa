It's always the same. I meet someone nice, have fun texting, or maybe spend time with them if I've met them in real life, and then suddenly it's over... ignoring, mostly ignoring, which I don't even understand. Why is someone ignoring me? Why hasn't someone stopped replying or only responds after a few hours? Not reading TikTok videos, which for me means I really like this person and want to show them something, but nothing... I don't need any explanations. Why am I second choice, after all? Why can't I be first? I just want to feel understood. I just want someone I can talk to about everything, send silly and funny videos, someone who simply won't leave me and will text me. Someone who will be the type of person who texts every day, "Hey, how was your day?" "Did you eat anything?" "Was it nice?" and not the type of person who texts nicely for a few weeks and then suddenly starts ignoring me...
