No family, no friends, no job, no girlfriend, or even a cat. I'm a college dropout with Asperger's and a 133 IQ. 

I've tried to make my life better, but every year is harder than the last one. I was homeless for 3 months; they stole my things twice, two phones and all my ID. 

I was also in a mental institution for six months due to failed suicide attempts.

I was raised by a narcissistic family that became more greedy and apathetic with every year that passed. I was born without a father. I didn't even know that I was autistic till I was 28. 

I just wanted to say that.
