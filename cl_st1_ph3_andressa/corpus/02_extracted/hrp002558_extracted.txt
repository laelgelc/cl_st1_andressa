The only thing I want is to just get a friend (even just one), friends who are willing to accept me and support each other, I have done self-harm because I am so lonely and I was diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist or psychologist.

I'm 19 and I've been in my room for years because of bullying trauma. When I was a child, I would often watch them play, but when I forced myself to join in, they disliked me because of my personality.

I hate myself
