I was removed from my home at 14 and never re united, I’ve tried having a relationship with my mom as an adult but it’s not functional. She’s a narcissist and the more I’m around her the more emotional turmoil I suffer. I’ve chosen to not speak to her which has helped me realize a lot about myself and the trauma I went through and I generally feel better emotionally but every year I’m always alone and the holidays really make me so depressed. I see people around me who even if it’s not always perfect having family. And idk I’m not jealous or envious I’m happy they have this but it just hurts why I don’t. Sometimes I wonder if I did something wrong in a past life and that’s why I’m left so lonely in this life. All year I work and distract myself but this time of year it’s so hard to ignore. I used to cope with drinking and smoking weed but honestly I can’t even use that as an escape anymore it feels like it just heightens my pain. Sometimes I don’t know how to push through. I have friends but I hate being a burden, that pity friend they invite to family gatherings so I just go silent during the holidays. I wish it wasn’t like this. I want to have a family so bad, people that care about me, check on me, people who are proud of me and how far I’ve come. I have a dog and he helps me at least have something to live for but without him I honestly don’t think I’d be here. Idk how to help myself during this time of year. it sucks cause my birthday is in January and it’s like October-February where this loneliness seems like a deep pit I can’t climb out of. I have siblings but I’m the youngest, they are all grown and have their own families and I’m just kinda forgotten, I don’t blame them they all live far away but I just wish I had what they did. I’m kinda just venting to the internet, wondering if there’s someone else out there who can relate.
