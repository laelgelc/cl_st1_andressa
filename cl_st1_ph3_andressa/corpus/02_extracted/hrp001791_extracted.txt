idk how to put things in words.., well, damn, i don't really have someone who i can talk about how i feel or going through.., it's not that i never had, i had, i did open up, but i wish that i never should have opened up in the first place.. 

idk, i maybe at the rock bottom of my life rn.. and i just don't know, but yeah, i keep going.. i wish, i was little lonely like this..
