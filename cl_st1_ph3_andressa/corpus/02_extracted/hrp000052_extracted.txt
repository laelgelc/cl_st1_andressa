(warning this gets kinda dark and I’m sorry if you don’t think you’ll be comfortable reading this then don’t) I’ve been really depressed lately and I even have been having suicidal thoughts. I don’t wanna die but I still get these thoughts. I try to talk to my parents about getting a therapist but 1. I’m really awkward and shit and 2. they don’t really listen to me anyway or take it as a joke. And even if they do listen to me they say “wElL yOuVe NeVeR cOmPlAiNeD aBoUt ThIs BeFoRe So StOp BeInG dRaMaTiC tO gEt AtTeNtIoN” and stuff like that. If you have any advice please tell me cos I’m a socially awkward piece of shit and I just can’t muster up enough courage to tell them about whats going on and I just really need help. (also mom if ur reading this im not being dramatic for attention i hate attention im being dramatic just to be dramatic) ok thats all thank you for your time.

Edit: it also doesnt help that im queer and homophobic people just cant accept the fact that we exist
