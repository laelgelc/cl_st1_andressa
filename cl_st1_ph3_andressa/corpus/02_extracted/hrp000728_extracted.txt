Hello fellow Redditors and like-minded socially awkward peeps!

Sooo I’ve got an extra ticket to see BØRNS (Garrett Borns) at The Novo in LA tonight!!!
The show starts at 8, and I’d like to get there around 7–7:30.

My concert buddy flaked, and I’m not about to dance alone (no matter how lousy my moves are) 😅
Looking for someone chill who loves BØRNS or his “pheromone electropop” vibes.

Groovy, chill energy, no weirdness. Just good music 🎶

Totally fine to meet at the venue or go separately if that’s more comfortable.
Let me know!!

EDIT: Forgot to mention. 18+ please! 21+ if you want to grab a drink. I am 34f, Long Beach local.
