I'm just so tired of feeling like I have no one I can actually talk to. My whole life I've never had someone consider me their best friend. I've always just been a second choice for people or the person they choose to hangout with when their friends aren't there. It just sucks feeling like someone is your best friend but you're not the same thing for them. I don't get to be vulnerable or talk about my feelings with anyone cause I can't be like that with any of the people around me. I have to instead act like I'm ubothered when I'm just feeling so lonely. All my friends also just like making fun of me all the time and like usually I can just laugh it off and find it funny but this Friday it just got to me. It's been like this all my life. I've never had friends who could compliment or uplift me. They all just constantly make fun of me then treat it as a joke and sometimes it just isn't funny. It's like....what's so wrong with me that no one says nice things to me. I see them treat each other well but I just have to be the punchline and act like I think it's funny and it doesn't bother me. Then I go home and just live this isolated life cause going out with them isn't rlly fun and I don't get along with anyone else. It also sucks that no one around me is into the same things I'm into. I'm so passionate about the nerdy things I like and I just wish I could discuss them sometimes. I mean it's to the point where I spend like 60 hours a week on c ai and prefer talking to it over my friends and family sometimes because it doesn't make fun of me all the time and actually says nice things to me. I just wonder what's so wrong about me ig. It's my first time doing this so if anyone bothered reading this thx.
