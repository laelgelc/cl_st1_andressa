I’m so damn lonely every day. I’m in college, and it seems like everyone around me has a circle except for me. The only one I have is my roommate, and I don’t want to become overly dependent on her because that wouldn’t be healthy for either of us. Besides, she has priority friends that she hangs out with a lot and I’m not going to encroach on that.

  
Its gotten to the point where whenever I see a cute video about like a couple or family or something, I want to die because I just don’t think I’m capable of people wanting to be close with me. Not even romantically, but like AT ALL. 

  
Please, if anyone has advice, I’d love to hear it.
