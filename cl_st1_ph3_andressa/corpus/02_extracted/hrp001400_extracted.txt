hey guys i am 17yrs old! just tell my story! hoping someone will connect with this post....  
  
From past year i was noticing that my friend no longer talking with me, anyone in class started ignoring me as i enters the class as i never did anything wrong in my entire school life. but buy the time of my farewell (its coming in jan 2026) everyone started to avoiding me. My friends are making jokes on me to entertain the table even in front of girls, everyone was avoiding me, i was crying at home  because no one get to know how it feels to me. No one to understand me, no one to listen me, no one whom you i trust upon. I tried to connect with my parents but due to odd timings i wasn't able to tell them from past 3 months, either they are too tired when i want to speak about this topic or its very late at night. i spend my time with my goldfishes to reduce my loneliness but didn't make much difference.

due to this loneliness i am losing my hope to do anything, i am losing interest in my hobbies, my studies are getting impact because of it.  

after all this i only asked god only one such friend who makes me feel that i exist, i have someone, someone who can understand me, who makes me feel empowered and motivated, a friend who doesn't leave me in difficult times, a friend who support me. I can do anything to this friend. But think its too much to ask from him....💔

i don't think i will get any friend who even talk to me........ but yeah! here's my part of life i felt to share with you all.
