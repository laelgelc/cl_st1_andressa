I'm sorry for this post, i am someone who doesn't share a lot, and i would like to share an experience i have had, which is really saddening. I am someone who has been depressed from years. A few months back (this is college), I got super severely depressed, and I was suicidal. I used to be involved with self harm activties, and for once i decided to take help, and then i was admitted. That is when I felt peak loneliness, not one human to ask me where i was, how i was, nothing. Nobody really cared. I thought I had friends. I realised how my living or dying did not matter to most people i thought were friends. It has been 6 months since then now and i havent been in touch with them and i realise more that it was always me trying to be in touch with them, and never them. 

For more context, i am a homosexual. I am tired of people laughing in the lift amongst themselves by giving sideyes referring to me and cracking internal jokes on me, me asking for help is equivalent to hitting on them, i feel so sick of people. I want to feel included, i want to feel cared for, i do not want to be alone always, having food alone everyday, crying everyday, and not knowing what to do. I have been alone since school, made fun of, bullied slighlty, i grew stronger past that and moved on, but i have been alone and left out everywhere anyways. I am barely seen as a human, more as a different species. I do not know what i could do, i try to tell myself it is not about me but about others, but it is sad anyways on some days.

THanks for listening :)
