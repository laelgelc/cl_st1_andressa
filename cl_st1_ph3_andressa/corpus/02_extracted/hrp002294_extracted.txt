F 33 now..I'm old I know. But I feel so miserable that I can't even enjoy my days anymore. I spent 3 hours in the kitchen cooking something good for dinner because I thought it would cheer me up and I haven't been able to eat it. I've been so depressed lately that I haven't been doing much. I don't really have any friends, and lately my one supposed best friend hasn't been talking to me lately. 

I got a few happy birthdays, my spouse tried to do something before he went to work. I got some happy birthdays from some old family friends and that's about it. I'm not expecting gifts, but I feel so ignored right now by people who said they cared about me. I just wish it would stop...I just wished for my birthday that thsi sadness would end that's all.
