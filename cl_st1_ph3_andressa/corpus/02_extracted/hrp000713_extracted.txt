Recently getting out of a long marriage. No kids and nothing to show for it. I tried to build a home with the woman i thought would be by my side till the end good or bad. But as time went on love became distant and feelings changed. I was always committed but things never got better. Now im here in a house alone full of memories. I want to find a woman that loves me for me and wont give up on us when things get rough. I live in eastern north Carolina i have my own place and i live alone. Its hard coming home to a empty house sometimes. I need a good woman with a loving heart to make this house a home again
