So I literally have 1 friend who lives 300 miles away, we’re not super close n talk occasionally. I have family but again not very close n also live 300 miles away. Everyday I feel so sad I have no one to talk to. I want to learn to enjoy my own company but I can’t. I just remember how no one checks in on me. I’d love to just be able to message someone about my day n what we get upto etc. I don’t know how to even learn to enjoy my company. I miss the feeling of just someone wanting to talk to me. This sucks 💔
