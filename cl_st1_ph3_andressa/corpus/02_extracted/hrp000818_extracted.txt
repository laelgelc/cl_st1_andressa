I think I have just been dealing with a lot of romance frustration. I haven’t tried to date since my heart got broken in July but it I still feel frustrated due to romance. Like nobody ever talks to me at work except for my teamlead. I see these attractive women talk to these guys but never ever come up to me and talk to me and that is what is frustrating me. It’s like I’ invisible or repulsive to women and that hurts. Not to mention how all I see all day is what I absolutely desire(a relationship) and how easy and everyone has it and that makes me more frustrated and that is why I have been so angry lately I hope I can stop feeling this way but I don’t think so. Quick side note guys we don’t have a moderator somebody needs to become a moderator here to deal with the spam and more importantly make sure this subreddit doesn’t get removed
