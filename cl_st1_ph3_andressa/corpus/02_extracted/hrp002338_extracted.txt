sometimes loneliness feels cool.. Instagram will make suggestions how staying alone is best thing possible, it's just cool uk. But, there's the other side when u r actually out in the world and u always feel stuck, u just can't express yourself. 

Idk, what to do. Here, it feels like staying alone, doing things are more cool. But, when u see other people doing same thing with other friends, it just make u bit jealous. Maybe jealous is the wrong word but yeah, maybe feels uncomfortable. 

What do u think?
