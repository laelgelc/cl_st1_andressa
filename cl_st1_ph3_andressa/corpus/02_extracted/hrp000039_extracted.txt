I am from New Jersey. I love reading books. I used to paint, I was good at portraits. And I have a love for animals...all kind. Currently unemployed. I haven't had a friend in 3 years. I am extremely lonely. Suffering from depression. I am just an ordinary being. If you are looking for friend too. I can be one.  **🙂**
