hello. i am lonely as fuck. i have been lonely most of my 20 years of living in this shithole. how you guys doing? how do you guys feel from all these social media posts of people in love, or with good friends? i feel like shit. i feel miserable, and like a failure. oh well, nothing new here. i just have to go as far as i can in life. how fun, am i right? every day has been the same for the past few years. at least i am back to college, and will be forced out of my room. anybody else like to stay in their room 23 hours a day? no? just me? coooooool... well, excuse me, i am going to doomscroll some more in my bed before i take a nap and wake up and waste the rest of the night on my laptop. goodnight, fellow lonely fucks.
