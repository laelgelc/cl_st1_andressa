I finally understand it, I now know the rearon of my self-isolating behavior. Since I was a teen I’ve had no feeling of belonging whatsoever, no roots to keep me still and no place nor people capable of making me feel comfortable, feel like I belong. This has always been an enigma to me and it has caused me a lot of suffering, but I have found it’s source.

The truth is I’m afraid of hurting others, I have always unconciously chosen other’s wellfare over my own. This started a vicious cycle, if someone gains interest in me I up and go in order to not hurt them, but this inevitably happens and so makes me consider myself an ass and a threat to everyone else and it just keeps going.

It is so clear now, I can see how this behaviour has shaped my life and my choices for years and now I hope this insight gained can help me get the shame and guilt off of my chest. Every friend I abandoned, every time I let my family down, every lover whose heart I’ve broken, let me say I’m sorry. Hopefully this can make me look at our memories together with nostalgia and hoy rather than regret and shame.
