Since last September, when my mom died of cancer, never felt so lonely in my entire life, always have to be there for everyone, and there is no single soul there for me, always need to be strong 24h for my father and my sister, always fighting all my battles alone, either at work or life, I'm always there for everyone, but when it comes to me, no one is here, I knew that this day would come, and I'm always preparing for the destined loneliness, however, I didn't know that it would be that painful
