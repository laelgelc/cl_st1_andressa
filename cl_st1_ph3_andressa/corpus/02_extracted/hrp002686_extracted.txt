I do understand that most of you have accepted being loners and also find joy in it. I'm a loner who still wish I had more of a life. 

I (22F) have been in med school in Kerala, India for the past 4.5 years. 1.5 more years to go. I live with my parents. I commute to and from college. I speak to the few classmates in my batch who're in the same dept as me for our clinical rotations. And that's all I do. All I've been doing since high school. I did have friends in middle school. But became a loner from high school. I can't relate to most things to do with the medical profession bcz, imposter syndrome. Plus the college I'm in is of a lower tier, as it's private and not a government college, which are the best. So obviously inferiority of that too. I'm posting this as part of my coping mechanism. I don't think I'm a bad person. I'm more or less a pushover. I agree with everyone's opinions, even tho I have some of my own as well. My parents are supportive in every way. However I just spend all my life at home, looking at my phone, eating, sleeping and sometimes cooking. And I work out. Idk what I'm trying to achive by saying all this. They're all just a couple facts abt my life. Anyway, even tho I don't have friends at college, going there everyday and attending rotations, is the only thing giving me a bit of self esteem at the moment. I have one internet friend tho, they're lovely. Also I believe I'm destined to be single for life even though I'm not extremely ugly, only like half ugly. Anyway, that's for another day. Ciao, thanks for listening. Stay Safe.
