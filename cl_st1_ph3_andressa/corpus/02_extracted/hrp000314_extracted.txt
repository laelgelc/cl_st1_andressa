Hello. I am 20-year-old college student majoring in music. I made friends fast in freshman year. It seemed like everyday was a new adventure. I hung out with so many different people, I felt so happy.

Every year, It seems like everyone is busier, which makes sense.

I started my junior spring semester last week and I'm so lonely. Everyone has tight knit friendroups and I'm not in any. I walk around my campus like a ghost. I have no friends in my classes. I try to join conversations, but it's obvious I don't belong. No one texts or calls, there seems to be hang outs, I just never hear about them. I try to keep myself busy these days by getting a job and taking harder courses, but it doesn't replace having a social life. I feel like I'm always on the outside. In a group of three with me, there's a duo I'm not apart of. In fact, recently it seems when I try to join two friends in between classes, they talk to each other while I just listen.

And the worst part is that my friends love me, or seem to. They surprised me for my birthday, comforted me when I was sad, and were always great to get advice from. But now, thats changed. They never seem to have time for me, but they have time for other friends. No matter where I am or who I meet, I always become sort of the 'Back-up friend'. Always the last to hear news, or the last one to be invited (if I am).

I'm silently suffering everyday and it just keeps getting worse.
