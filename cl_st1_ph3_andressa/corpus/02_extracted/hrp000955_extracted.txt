Every time I go to the mall and see people my age being fit, with friends, with nice clothes, with partners, I almost get panic attacks. I once had to go to the bathroom because I could not breathe. They are living the life they desire and I'm just a failure who is stuck and can't do anythkng, who can't even function. I haven't hugged someone lovingly in a year. Everytime I see cute girls my age pass me by I get very sad. I miss human love but no one cares about me. If I died tomorrow life goes on. Not even my suffering matters.
