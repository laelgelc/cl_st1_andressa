21M here. on the surface you might think i got a lot going for me. I‘m wrapping my bachelors degree, am pretty close with my family and travel often with them, applying for masters and have a job and projects on the side. 

However beneath the surface i’m merely just existing. My goals are all over the place and I end up not doing anything of note throughout the day. I’m not a hardworking individual by any measure, and barely just scrape by my assignments. I have very few friends, and i don’t really do much with them. I live in college but am not involved in campus life or any fun stuff. I dont go to parties or drink or do drugs or hookup or even talk to girls. I just go to classes and come back to my dorm trying to figure out what I wanna do every day but end up not doing anything much. Even though all my colleagues and my boss at work are super cool people I don’t really talk to them or take initiative in doing stuff. Every day just feels like i’m killing time. No purpose, no fun stuff, just killing time. Due to my background and upbringing I feel a crippling sense of not belonging anywhere. Even though I know the person I’m inside, outside I’m a literal walking mannequin npc devoid of any personality. 

yeah idk man
