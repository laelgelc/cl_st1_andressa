maybe i’m being a little bit dramatic because one of my friends wished me happy birthday and a couple people in my family did. but most of my friends haven’t. i can’t tell if it’s they forgot or if they just don’t care enough but i feel like it could go either way. i’m not surprised tbh i would have been more surprised if they would have wished me happy birthday. it hurts because even my best friend hasn’t. i haven’t had a happy birthday since i was like 7 lol so i just really hope it gets better at some point because im 22 now.
