No family called me yesterday. Kinda sad, but at least I dont need to pretend like I was wanting them to, although i half expected it.
Had a few friends reach out and wish Merry Christmas. Even one slid me a $100 as a gift! I wish I could give money myself. 

I worked all day for Christmas at Waffle House so I couldn't find time to step away and talk for long on the phone, returning the sentiment.  And when I got home I was dead tired.

I like being alone, but I know my soul wants companionship... connection... intimacy. 

I like the freedom of living alone and being free from other people's rules and restrictions. The downside is that the part of my life where nobody called or reached out to me anyway (except for a few, and on certain occasions) is amplified. 

Hope everyone had a great Christmas.
