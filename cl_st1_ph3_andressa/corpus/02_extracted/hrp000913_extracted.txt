I'm ugly, im a sore to look at. Whenever i show someone what I look like it just ends with them never talking to me again. I think deep down my friends struggle to look at me and talk to me because of my face. I just wish I could change my face. Start over and make myself look appealing. Every time I look into the mirror and I'm just filled with rage and anger because what kind of sin did I commit to deserve to look like this? To be the size of a football player but remain invisible to everyone around me. No one will look at me. No one sees me. I just want someone to see me
