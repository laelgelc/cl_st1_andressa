We aren’t monsters, we are human. We all deserve somebody. And I’m trying so hard not to turn it towards myself because I know I’m kind, I know I’m caring. I’m just a little neurodivergent is all. So I’ve accepted it’s gonna be a different path for me with relationships. It sucks it has to be this way.. sometimes I wish I could just be normal.
