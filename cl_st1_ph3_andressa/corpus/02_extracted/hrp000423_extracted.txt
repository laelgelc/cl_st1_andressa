sometimes I feel like I don't want relationships. I want ownership. not in a weird way. I just feel like I can't connect with people normally. 
I'm below everyone. we'd never be on equal footing. I'm below everyone. rather have control of everything. I'm below them. I wouldn't want that kind of relationship but sometimes it feels like the only way I'd have one. it's also a fear of vulnerability I think. I'm scared of being hurt. they can't hurt me if I'm above them. I'd never hurt them if they wouldn't hurt me. it all checks out right?

realizing how stupid this sounds considering I'd never be able to get in a relationship in the first place. fucking loser.

(feel the need to clarify, relationship doesn't only refer to romantic. platonic as well, though to a lesser extent since that's less vulnerable. only slightly lesser though. though though though though though
