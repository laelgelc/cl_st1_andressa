I dont spend time with people outside of work, soni started socializing on my off time right after work with people I know. 

I've been told not to make friends with people I work with. Then who the hell am I going to try to be friends with if I can't be friends with people I already know?

Just walk down the street say hello to some person i dont even know and ask hey how are you doing today. 

Or go sit alone at a tim hortons to drink coffee and hope someone starts a conversation with me.

I dont go to bars or drink at all, so at my age who am I going to be freind at this age? 

This socializing is so backwards today.

And finding someone to date, you have to a have hope high hell its actually going to work.
