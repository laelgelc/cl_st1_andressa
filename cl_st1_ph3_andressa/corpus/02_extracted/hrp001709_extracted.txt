i don’t really have any experiences since all my life i have spent it in my room. as a kid to now almost an adult. i have always had a hard time making friends, dealing with depression and anxiety and never even had a relationship. all i do is consume media like video games, movies and some small hobbies that aren’t very time consuming. im very sad how i have 0 experiences, i just want someone to love me and hug me and tell me it’s going to be okay. but im just lonely and sad and have no desire to live
