I believe in solving our own problem - ourselves. And loneliness is one of those problems which I believe we can solve ourselves.

The way I have solved and continue to solve my loneliness problem is by becoming a more valuable person to the people around me - that is working on hard technical skills and social skills.

I am looking to build something for people like me - who are willing to work on themselves - to become better version of themselves first and then getting what they want - more social validation from people around them - for who they are.

**What we will do:**

We can work together in identifying what one thing can make a big impact on your life - professional or otherwise, then we can build a game plan and work on execution. Along with that we can work on exploring avenues for socializing that is more suitable for you - and then finding better ways to present yourself there.

I will help you get better while I learn what I need to build for the product.

If you are up for this, please drop me a message.

Cheers.
