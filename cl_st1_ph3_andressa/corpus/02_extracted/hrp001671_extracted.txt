I am quite old. And I am too tired to be social. I used to have lots of friends, but now I have none. I don't have a family or a reliable job. I spend almost every day fearful for my future, or wishing that it would all just end. I guess this goes beyond loneliness, but it's like I'm both lonely and so unhappy with myself that I can't be around people -- all at the same time. Does anyone know what I mean? Or am I all alone in these experiences too? No one I know (or have ever known) lives like this.
