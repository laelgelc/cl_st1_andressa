I've been seeing so many posts and discussions on male loneliness. I am a generally progressive/leftist person so I naturally see more stuff from that perspective and the current consensus seems to be that the men who are lonely are evil fascists who deserve it, they say that men aren't really lonely and we should just leave the house and socialize 

I'm 22 and I've joined clubs at my university and gone to events to try to make friends. I go to the gym, I've asked girls out and tried every app under the sun but nothing seems to work, I feel so lonely but I genuinely don't think im an evil man, im not saying I'm entitled to friends or a girlfriend, im just sad that everyone around me seems to have those things except me, I just want connection. 

I don't understand why people are saying things like this to lonely men, I feel like a lot of us aren't bad guys but just unlucky (and autistic). I keep feeling like I must be evil or something if im still so lonely. Why does society tell men to be more open about our feelings and when we are it's used to insult us? Im tired of feeling this way, im not perfect but im not a bad person and I know that, I wish I knew what was wrong with me but I don't.
