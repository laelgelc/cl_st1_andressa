Hey everyone. I’m posting because I feel stuck between grief and survival and could really use some perspective.

I moved to Las Vegas to live with my cousin. He was my roommate and a huge part of my support system. Unexpectedly, he passed away. Losing him alone has been devastating but what made it even harder was that his passing left me and my dog with only about two weeks to figure out where to live and what to do next.

Luckily for me i have a really strong support system back in Texas so i know im loved. I sometimes feel guilty because i know they worry because im a young woman 1000s of miles away from my birth family. I’ve moved out of our shared house & have gotten a new apartment since everything happened (December 29th) but sometimes i feel overwhelmed at how quickly my life changed. Its like i’ll look around my new home and feel completely displaced even though i love it.

 I’ve been trying to stand on my own in a city that still feels like home but I don’t have family here, and my circle is very small. Most days it’s just me, my dog & sometimes my boyfriend , navigating grief quietly while the world keeps moving.

I’m also an aspiring nail tech, currently working toward building a future for myself. I love the craft and the creativity, but some days it’s incredibly hard to stay motivated when everything feels unstable and emotionally heavy. I’m grieving someone I moved here for, while also trying not to let my life completely unravel.

I guess I’m just trying to figure out how people do this — how you process loss while being forced to grow up fast ( just turned 27 yesterday ) , relocate fast, and keep showing up for your goals. If you’ve experienced sudden loss, displacement, or rebuilding your life far from home, how did you cope? What helped you keep going?
