So I (22M) decided to go out today trying to enjoy the last day of the week… but I kind of regret it because it reminded me of how much lonely I’m… everyone got their group of friends or at least just one person to enjoy their day with and I was the only one alone… I tried to approach some of groups but they all rejected me saying they don’t need a new member which I totally respect and understand… the only thing that hurts me is that I have been always alone… I never had friends in real life to go out with… I have been always going out and spending my time alone… like am I not allowed to have friends ?? It completely hurts
