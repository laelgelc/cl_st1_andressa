Im alone, but even still, there are posts I can read here every night and connect with. Obviously not all of them of course, but there's something here for everyone that most people can resonate with.

I think that some of us have been alone for so long that we've created  this shell around ourselves to protect us from our troubles, whether it was willingly or instinctively through something that occurred, but i don't want to stay In that shell forever or maybe I do, I'm not even necessarily completely sure. I can only speak for my self because I'd rather not speak for others but it's alright to want to feel protected.

It's weird I don't usually write deep topics like this, usually it's just venting, guess I'm just bored. Might delete this later maybe, idk
