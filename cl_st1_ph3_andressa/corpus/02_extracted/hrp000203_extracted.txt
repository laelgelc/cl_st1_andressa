I’m an attractive guy. Every girl i have met has told me that i’m really handsome, i’ve had people come up to me just to tell me that, but i’ve been alone for pretty much my entire life.

I felt lonely around my friends, i felt like it was all just superficial. I got out of a relationship almost 6 months ago & everything has just felt weird since. I’m the loneliest i have ever been & i feel nothing at all..
