I’m alone. I have no friends. No family. I’m in Japan, far from everything I’ve ever known. I never thought I’d end up here, like this surrounded by people, yet completely invisible. I’m going through a divorce I never wanted. I tried to fix everything, every mistake, every fight, every moment that went wrong. Every time I thought I was doing better, something dragged me right back down.I have a four-month-old son. My boy. There’s an investigation now they think my wife hurt him, that she shook him. I can’t believe any of this is real. I didn’t want any of it. I just wanted my family. I wanted us.
I loved her. I still love her. I know I don’t deserve her, but I would’ve done anything to make it right. She was going to take my son away from me. I tried to stop it, but I couldn’t. Now I have nothing. I have no one.Even after everything, I know she’ll still take him from me. She’ll find a way. I’ve always been alone , I thought I was used to it until I met her. For the first time, I wasn’t. Now she’s gone, and it hurts more than before.People tell me I’m young, that I have my whole life ahead of me. But they don’t understand , I wanted to spend that life with her. I can’t make her love me. I tried. I’m still trying, even though I know it’s hopeless.
All I ever wanted was a family. I didn’t want my son to grow up without a parent. But here I am, alone again. Maybe this is just how it was always going to be. I wish I wasn’t born.
