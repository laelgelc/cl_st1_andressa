hi !! i dont really feel confortable talking about this to my friends because i know that i am not alone. i recently broke up with my ex boyfriend of 5 years and even though im over the relationship, i cannot help feeling alone. i mean im in a period of a lot of changes, i will soon graduate from my master's degree and my uni friends will leave the COUNTRY, my ex and i broke up, i am hesitating about going abroad for a year as well and that means that i will need to quit my job as well and wont see my colleagues anymore and this is terrifying

i feel like at the end of the year i will enter a stage of life where people are alone? how did you guys cope with the end of your education?
