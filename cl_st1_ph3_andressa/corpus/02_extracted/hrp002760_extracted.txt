Currently i spend hours only to watch pointless Youtube videos everyday. Wondering if there are place to be with as "special" such as myself, not really lonely, but place to share and rejoice would be nice change to current life style.

not talking dating sites or newgrounds, reddit, 4chan etc.just a place to find new interest in all overall, love music, art, games, different people, stories, movies, backgrounds, anime, etc. like to see and listen. deviantart is nice place, like site where i could be in group and share with random people stuff like "check this out" like not "big" community just a 10 to 20 persons as in group. like a random watzup groups.

sigh... well best example is like going to bar hit some girls, meeting some buddies while at it, dancing, drinking, getting drunk, some small-talking, etc.  
But no. Dislike all that trouble would rather do that at internet, like a chat just for some few random persons (not a gamers, artists, sobers, loners, memers, tubers, streamers, otakus, etc.) who can be anyone, whose do things they do, but come to sometimes together at "(the place i look for now)".  
are there place like that open for people like us? just a harmless, like a little terrace/deck would be in real life to be.

Sorry for long post, but seen quite few places, forums, etc. etc... but Either i quit for year, or the site dies, everybody moves on, and gone, So that's like the case now. yet i haven't found anything for me for while. (facebook is nice yet i use it like once in a month and nobody chats me nor i do chat with them, (sometimes i do, but it's takes effort to come up things to talk to when i do basically nothing, or i cant tell the story that it would be interesting conversation). but with "fake alias" I could go to extends and spread tales, etc. (youtube chat box ain't so exiting thing nowadays).
