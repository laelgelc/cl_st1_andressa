Hey all. 27m here. I'm older now, so I'm afraid it's too late now or I just lost my chance. I've had relationships before, but mostly all when I was younger, and mostly online. I don't really fully count them because we never really did much. I don't know why, but I've always been obsessed with love and the idea of getting with someone. That's how I've always been. I know you basically have to be stable first, but I don't know how to stop thinking like this. I'd do whatever it takes, and just want to have someone I can spoil, but I just feel it'll never happen again. 

That's why my depression hasn't been this bad in so many years. To me, if I can't have it. I see no other meaning to my life. I'm terrified of getting older and then it'll become harder, or even impossible.
