I just graduated. I have my degree in computer science but I'm self employed and working from home. I'm also neurodivergent, and making new connections is scary and hard. I still have some friends from highschool, and they're wonderful, but we hang out once a week. I know I'm lucky to still have that. The tipping point was when I broke up with my ex. It was dwindling for a a while but they were still my best friend and while it was really unhealthy for me, at least I wasn't alone. I make a lot of nsfw posts but really I just wish I could be around other people in any way. 

Even the slightest bit of genuine human interaction is such a relief. When someone says hi to me, even that makes me feel happy for a moment. Sometimes the highlight of my day is someone asking me for directions.

Making friends as an adult is so much harder.
