Just wanted to post my thoughts I guess. I don't know about anyone else on this sub but I find it hard to meet people and properly be friends with them. Its hard because often I just can't find like minded people and people that actually understand me, or people that I am able to get a proper deeper friendship with. 

I have had friends before where I am able to kinda socialise and be there but nothing that they do or talk about properly interests me, there never comes a point where I can see a better connection, so it ends up with me just basically coasting in a limbo state where I don't really enjoy being with them. 
Hence why I now mostly play games and do stuff at home because I find that to be better for me and I'm happier. 

I do want to meet some people though to get those proper connections with, as I have a few times in my life before. It's just hard and yeah I worry that later in life I won't have anyone there basically. 

So yeah, sorry rant over. Just sharing thoughts. Feel free to comment or message with your thoughts/experiences and if anyone feels the same! 

Have a good day all!
