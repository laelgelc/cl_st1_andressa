I have discord because i dont really talk on here at all anymore but i have just been feeling lonely lately and have no one to really turn to when i need them most. 

All of my “friends” all have their own little friend group they go to and when im with them its like im just some shadow to them, like im invisible. 

So i guess if im not good at making true friends irl i was maybe hoping i could make some online at least so i can have them to look forward to talking to through out the day. 

However I am a female so i hope thats not a bother
