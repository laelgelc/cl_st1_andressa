Yeah, like I said I feel like everything I do doesn't go well for me, it's really hard to explain all what's going on, I need someone to whom I can talk to. But there's no one, I don't have any friends. Completely lonely, I'm even loosing my hobies I don't enjoy things which I used to do. It's just plan boring life, I hate it. I hate myself
