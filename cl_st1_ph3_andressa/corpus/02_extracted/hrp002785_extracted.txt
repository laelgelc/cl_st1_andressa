I use to crave not being alone and not wanting to just be by myself in public i.e) eating, sitting etc. Nowadays I love it, I just love me some me getting to know myself better, self development,  and to striving for success... I feel people who are constantly trying to find a scene or people to hang with all the time loose a sense of themselves and just become super mainstream and unoriginal. I do have people I can hang with and I do feel its important to socialize from time to time, im just more inclined to be solo.
