I'm a male 23, I've never been asked out or in a relationship, I have severe social anxiety, my depression has made me physically decay after I stopped caring about myself the only thing I have is 2 friends that I game with occasionally, when stop playing I sit there for 5 hours trying to hold back tears cause I know I'll be alone for a while again, I hate this soo much
