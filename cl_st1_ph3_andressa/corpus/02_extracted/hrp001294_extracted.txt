Being a lonely teen is hard, especially if you really don't have friend to go out with either their busy or too far, the only friend I have is in the province for a while. It's destroying me really, I feel... Miserable at best, I have to spend New Years alone because my grandparents have to be out of town. Having no things to do is very tiring mentally, I would rather do anything just to get out of this web that I've created with my own mistakes, I left my friends, my girlfriend that was the only one supporting me just because I was confused on what I was feeling that time, now she's happy with another man glowing brighter than ever while I'm here miserable asf with 
3-5 friends that I know I can trust. I have a problem of not being able to express/understand my own feelings and it's ruining everything good that is coming to me, my only escape is the gym and due to this problem I've skipped the whole month of December. Planning to lock in next year then leave all of this shit behind in 2025, but rn? It's not going great.
