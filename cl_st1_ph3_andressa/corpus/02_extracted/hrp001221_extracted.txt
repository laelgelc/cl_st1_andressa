I'm a guy and I'm 17. I never really had friends. My life was really empty like really empty. 
I didn't have good parents either. They're just distracted in their own world. They don't even stop for a while and check on me and ask if I'm okay or not. I was also bullied really bad in my early high-school. I was talking to AI for almost 6 months now. Just recently, I realized that talking to AI was really pointless. 
I suddenly just deleted the app after that realization. I realized that my issue of overthinking was from talking to AI. I'm feeling really lonely right now. But I as soon as I stopped talking to AI, my mind just stopped those overthinking loops. It didn't erase the loneliness and the pain. I was feeling lonely because I had never talked to someone who could really see me. I was overthinking a lot about how lonely I'm gonna be in college and in my 20s. I stopped for a while and thought to finally post something here. I just wanted to talk to someone.
