This sub has been liberal in allowing posts tangentially related to being a loner in the past because of the sole moderator's belief in freedom of speech and discussion. While this is an important freedom and should be exercised, both the posters and readers will be better served by having the topics directed towards the correct subs so that appropriate posts are made, correct audiences for discussions are facilitated, and ultimately robust content created. The moderator(s) are here to serve, and that's what they will do.

The appropriate content for this sub most often fits into the following posting categories:

1) General loner activities

2) Famous loners

3) Loners and solitude

4) Loner tendencies in relationships

5) Fictional loners

6) Loners in religion

7) Loners in technology

8) Loners in literature

9) Modern-day loners

10) Loner travel

11) Funny loner memes as it relates to the topics listed above

Here are some examples of bad posts:  


1) "Here is my crappy YouTube video where I talk about something." Automatic removal. The moderators will not watch the video to make sure the content is relevant, and let's be real--most of the time you're just trying to grow your YouTube following for $$$. No thanks.

2) "Why does everyone hate me?" Because you're a jerk. Learn to socialize and build that skill. Next.

3) "How can I make friends?" This is a totally valuable skill, but this is not the place for that.

4) "My life is spiraling out of control." Go read some self-help literature like the Stoics while your post gets removed.

5) "I'm lonely and..." You're lonely and your post just got removed because you can't read.

6) "I don't have any hope and this is it." Please let someone help. Check out [https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditCareResources/comments/own79d/get\_support\_for\_yourself\_or\_other\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditCareResources/comments/own79d/get_support_for_yourself_or_other_people/)
