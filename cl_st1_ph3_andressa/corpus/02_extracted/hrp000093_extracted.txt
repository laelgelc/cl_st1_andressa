I've noticed this sub has hardly had any activity since its conception, so I'm hoping to get things going again. Our Discord server has also been decreasing in activity as of late, which is quite unfortunate. If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this sub, please let us know!

I'd also like to plug our Minecraft server, which I now realize is currently only available through the Discord server, which I know not everyone is a member of. The code for entry is: **5.135.32.9:25595**, in case anyone is interested.
