So I'm 22 now, and since high school I've always felt very lonely and I always heard that you can feel lonely even though there's people around you. However, km like truly alone, I don't remember ever having anyone wanting to be my friend, much less having any romantic/sexual interest in me. I don't know if there is something wrong with, but I feel so bad about it everyday, I feel like I'm missing on life.
