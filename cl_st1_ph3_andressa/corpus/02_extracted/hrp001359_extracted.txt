I've been isolated for years because I lack confidence/social skills. I try so hard to be an acceptable version of myself because I want to connect with others but it's exhausting. I have no friends and most days I don't socialize with anyone. The loneliness I experience everyday is crippling.I'm so tired of being like this. I just want to do normal social things. I want to be able to connect with people.
