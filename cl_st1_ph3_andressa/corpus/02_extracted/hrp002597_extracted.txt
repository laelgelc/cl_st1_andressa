Well, as human, I felt kind of lonely, so I went to a bar and walked in, had a few drinks. Just wasn't happy. I feel like people have a low level of intelligence. One guy who said he was gonna play a game of pool with me was high on bullshit talking about selling coke and shit. I sometimes resent wanting social interaction. I even dislike my coworkers to a slight degree. Oh yeah, I know I'm not any better. I know I'm just as stupid but at least I can see a fully decaying society. Oh well it is what it is. At least there's things that we can agree with. But in general people suck.
