I’m a person who experience such deep connections, not even just in a relationship way, but in a platonic way as well. It’s hard finding friendships who only use you to talk about their relationships. Lately Ive just been through so much and I really just want connection. Not just someone to vent to because they saw this post, but true genuine connection, whether it’s platonic or romantic…… It would make my life so much easier and enjoyable
