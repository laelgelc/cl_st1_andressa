I came to US for my master’s from Iran and been living here for the past 4 years. Almost not a day goes by that I don’t think about how alone I am and when actually brooding over this, i realized I actually have been alone in any circumstances, whether at college, traveling,  work or doing any activity if i needed a buddy it was me that had to call up sb. For the past two years office and remote working has made it harder to distance myself from feeling this way. after graduation, due to some immigration necessities and policies, i had to move to a new state (Texas) to a city where I didn’t know anyone. I’ve come to accept the fact that this is my life and will be a default mode and no matter what, my life to this point consists of constant inclination to get away from my past (i lived in two countries before moving to the states) is an essential defining part of my lifestyle that has been embedded for such a long time that I may feel lost when I’m with others and will always crawl back to be alone on my own again. It sucks that when I need to go to a museum or cinema, i see everybody being in groups. Thankfully i have found the courage to do everything alone so going to public places by myself isn’t an issue but its just painful that these reminders upon seeing other ppl enjoying their time together is a quality i can’t seem to have access to. I’m 29 and have put a pause to dating as I saw that i can’t bear the fact that a part of my alone time is a piece of mind that gets disrupted once I have to dedicate that time to sb else’s that I don’t have any control over like how i can manage my time reading a book or going to the gym. In other words, i like to go out and have fun with a person but all the little menial tasks like replying messages that comes with it are a compromise to my own time outside of work that I don’t think is worth in exchange of a possible public activity.
