Being alone when I was younger felt heavy. Im not minimizing that. 

Im not sure why I posted this. Embrace the clean slate and all the adventures open to you. Whatever it takes, avoid it while you hold the agency to do so. There will be several events that you will strip you down and bring aloneness without your control.

Maybe someone could have a change of perspective on their sad alone is  actually wicked cool independence. 

I am 39. Widowed. No friends. No family near me. Not on social media. 

Legit alone. Yet nothing like the sense of being alone after my loss. I thought I knew alone before. I learned later and so will you.
