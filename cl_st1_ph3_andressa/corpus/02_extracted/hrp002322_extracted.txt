Like that girl/guy at the corner of your class that you like but can never approach so that you can't ever let her know you have no friends



Like the other ppl in class or really anywhere in public. Like I spend all day at the library in between classes at my university, what do they think of me?



Or really anybody else, not trying to be poetic but i feel like we loners think about this a lot. Would be great to know how they feel about us, what they think we are, no matter how harsh it is
