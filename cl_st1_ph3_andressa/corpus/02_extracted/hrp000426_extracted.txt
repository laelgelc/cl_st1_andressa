So I am 37 and I recently lost my first pregnancy ever to have a surgery then to find out I need a full hysterectomy… My only sister that I grew up with passed away from cancer a few years ago and all I have left is my mom and my stepdad… And nobody understands when I say that I’m gonna be like old and alone I often say like when I pass, the neighbor is just gonna smell me… But nobody gets it and they’re like why do you think like that and now that my chance for having a kid is over I’m not rich so I can’t afford surrogacy and all that stuff
