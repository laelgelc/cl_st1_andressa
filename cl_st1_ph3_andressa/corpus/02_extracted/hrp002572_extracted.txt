I am a teenage boy who is a high school student and a loner too. My grades went bad and I am struggling in my face-to-face classes which is a huge change I need to adjust by myself. I researched online on how to have fun and study well but many articles and discussions online said that studying in groups can make it more "fun" and "effective" but I doubt it since I am an introvert and a loner. I tried to find one in my class and my friends but none of them is available. How to study alone effectively and still have fun, please?
