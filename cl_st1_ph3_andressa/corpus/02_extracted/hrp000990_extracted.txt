Past few years I’ve spent all my birthdays working because there is nobody to celebrate with.
I don’t have any relatives, but had one person I considered my sister and I her brother, but she denounced me recently for quitting a job we both worked. Now I just sit here scrolling through YouTube, streaming services not watching anything, same for my game library. I don’t have friends or family, no friendly enough coworkers. Is there anything I can do to feel something? I don’t feel like I even exist right now, i can’t bring myself to do anything worth while because I feel like I need to do something with somebody else. I’ll take hobby suggestions that I can do by myself or game recommendations. Anything to pretend I have a life.

Edit: I’m 19 Male, it’s been like this since I was 7. Crippling depression, slight schizophrenic, ADHD.
