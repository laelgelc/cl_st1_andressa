i also posted this on  r/trueoffmychest  but i thought it might resonate more with some people here

im in my second year and i dont think ive ever been this lonely in my whole life. my only friends are my roommate and one of my suitemates from last year, and they’re both always busy + have other friends. my roommate is always working and shes close with her coworkers, so she normally gets home from work and immediately leaves again to go meet them at a bar or something. my other friend is in a sorority so she’s also always hanging out with other people. i just sit at home by myself and cry because i feel so alone. i do have a girlfriend that i love so much but she goes to a different university and what i need is FRIENDS.

this year, me and my roommate decided to get an off campus apartment instead of living in the dorms and i regret that so much. when you live on campus theres always something going on, but now i just feel so disconnected. theres so much pressure to have fun in college and i feel like i’m wasting all of my time here. im currently rushing and im terrified for bid day. any time i think about maybe not getting a bid i get so nauseous i feel like i’m gonna throw up. i dont know what else to do. ive though about transferring but im scared i wont meet anyone and all ill have done is take myself away from the three people that i do have.

every time i go on social media im bombarded with pictures of people at my school having the time of their lives and it hurts so bad. im so ungodly jealous of them. my mental health is in the garbage, i cry almost every day and i am just so unhappy right now. i hate it here so much.

i dont even know why im posting this. i guess i just wanted to tell someone. i feel like im drowning.
