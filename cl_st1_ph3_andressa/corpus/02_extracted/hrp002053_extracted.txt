Well here we are, the first day of February. Me (21M) has always despised this month and valentine's day in general, my entire life ever since I was in elementary school was built on rejections and humiliations from girls I've tried to ask out. At the start of this year I thought I had found someone after all this time, only to be met with the exact same result as every other time. I hate it because valentine's day is the day I feel most alone, my parents always go out for it, all my friends are taken and go with their partners, I'll be alone again and won't have anyone to support me, again. I don't know how much longer I can take this...
