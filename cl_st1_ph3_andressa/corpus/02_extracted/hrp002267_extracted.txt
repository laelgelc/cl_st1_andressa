When I was a little girl, my teacher asked me, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”
I said I don’t know, and I felt embarrassed to answer because all my classmates had answers except me.

As I got older, I watched everyone else know who they are and what they want to be
And I still have no answer… I’m still wondering where I’m supposed to be.
I don’t have anyone or a job or anything
I’m just alone, lost, confused, and disconnected from everything 
I have no place at all in this world. 

I wonder if anyone else feels like they don’t really belong anywhere.
