40 year old man here.  After a decently long marriage, it ended in divorce a few years back, loosing both her and the step kids all at once. I was living a happy family life with her and the kids and before i knew it everything was gone any friends i had was through the marriage, been struggling to make friends since! Im rather introverted with groups of people i dont know. I dont drink so dont go to bars, i go to church and have tried different churches but often walk in, hear the service and walk back out without hardly anyone paying any attention to me! Other than my parents and siblings i have no one to talk to!

Wether it be for normal friends or for someone to date i have had no luck either way. Have tried several dating websites, i pay the subscriptions send out emails but rarely does anyone respond. its either all bots, or just people on there because they thought it would be cool to create a profile but otherwise are not interested! Ideally dating wise would to be someone that already has kids, so i can jump back into the family life that i loved and that i suddenly lost! We spent so much time traveling the usa going to so many fun places! just so longing to have that life back again!

I am self employed in a very successful online lego retail business, but that also means no coworkers either! Interest of mine include any sorts of traveling around the USA, beaches, swimming, board games, comedy tv shows and movies, bowling, mini golf. Etc Not looking for advice of how to get friends, as i have already tried everything im comfortable with! Private message me if you feel like i do and would like to chat!  Hoping to make friends to chat online, but hoping to make friends to be with in person as well. I travel around the USA a lot, so if we hit it off as friends online we maybe can meet in person some time in the future! As most of all i want to have physical people in my life and not just online chat buddies, thats all i have had for the past few years!
