To anyone alone feeling alone doesn’t have anyone I busy want to say hello you are important in this life don’t forget that. Everyone has to go through these kind of situations and feelings it builds character as a person. Everyone says focus on yourself like it’s easy when you’re really feeling insecure and invisible it’s not easy but one thing is God is putting you through this situation cause blessings are coming your way best believe that. I wouldn’t say focus on yourself like everyone else does I would say love yourself love everything about yourself and embrace it. Embarrassment is an under felt emotion who cares about what others think. You enjoy all the blessings in your life including your health anything even being able to walk love yourself so when that time comes when someone comes into your life you are ready to take love and give. You can’t love someone if you don’t love yourself!! You might feel alone but you ain’t.
