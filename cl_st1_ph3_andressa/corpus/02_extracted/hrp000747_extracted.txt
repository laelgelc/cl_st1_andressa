I'm tired of getting the same old advice on well are you even making an effort and putting yourself out there? yes literally it seems like no one cares to make new friends... I have tried different dance studios, didn't have any luck in college, and try to talk to people and even complimenting them on their outfit and people get so weirded out. 

I'm a bubbly person and I have been told I'm really nice but no one wants to talk. I love listening to people and getting to know but anytime I reach out to someone new or from high school they cut the conversation short or I get ghosted. I know I'm not pushy so idk what to do anymore lol I live I southern California and women are so rude here. I love gaming, snowboarding, movies and cars but I can't seem to relate. I don't drink/smoke or go clubbing which makes it hard.
