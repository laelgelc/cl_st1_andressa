just feel lonely in my class.
Hello all together, since August 1 am in my new class and none of my former classmates are with me.
Don't unterstand me wrong, I have friends in classmate and we have a good friendship all together, but only in class. Most of the time I feel like they don't see me really (even in class) and especially when I'm home, then I have nothing to do with anyone, expect of homework or something like this and then is this with the love feelings for one of my classmates (we are 4 boys and 9 girls)
