I've slowly come to the realization that I am the problem. It's not intentional it's just really hard to believe in people. I've come to expect others to disappoint me. So, I will often withdraw or run away before they get the chance to. I also get extremely anxious when people actually treat me well. It challenges my beliefs and that terrifies me.
