You see people having someone they can talk to

whereas you have no one

Can’t even express yourself

I wonder why it’s like that

Just devoid of any emotions and numb

Losing yourself

Years of isolation really affected me now I find it so difficult to interact with others but craving that too sometimes

so messed up ..
