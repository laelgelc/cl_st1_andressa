I am searching for open-minded company, especially company that can text me in Galician, Tuscan or any other Italian language or Hispanic language.

I can reply to you in English, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.

I am skilled enough to teach English and Portuguese, but not much skilled yet with Hispanic languages and Italian languages, but I am always trying to improve things for everyone daily.

We can reply in English at any time if we did not understand something the other texted.

I am a 26 years old, Latin American and panamorous person that is very open minded instead of judgemental.

I am open to a large diversity of adult body, personality and connection types, but I prefer to be like friends first before and also after anything else.

I am also open to texting about nature, food, games, movies, music, arts, philosophies, among other diverse topics.
