M17, never been lonelier. Everyday I wake up with this feeling that I’m nobody’s favorite person, and this just f** me up. About a month ago I deleted all of my socials, and tonight I decided to download Snapchat, to see if I had missed something important, but nothing. Not even I hi from my (what I tought) closest friends. One month is a lot, in my opinion. I just need this someone in my life.
