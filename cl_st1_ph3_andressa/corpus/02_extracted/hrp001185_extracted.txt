28M from Spain, if anyone needs or simply wants to have a conversation about anything (movies, books, hobbies, sports, video games, what keeps you up at night, what gets you out of bed each morning, feelings, introspection, philosophical thoughts... really, anything) DM me.

For my part, I'm someone who goes to the movies weekly, plays chess and padel, I'm starting to exercise, I enjoy cooking as an amateur, and I currently work in freight transport.

Again, feel free to DM me if you want.
