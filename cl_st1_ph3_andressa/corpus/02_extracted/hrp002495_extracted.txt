It’s gotten to the point where Seeing other people and their happy relationships (romantic or platonic) makes me either really sad or angry. Yes I know this is pathetic and no I don’t say anything because that would be even more so. I understand how unhealthy this is and was hoping some of you would have suggestions on how to quiet these thoughts? I just keep wondering “what makes them better than me” “when is it going to be my turn”
