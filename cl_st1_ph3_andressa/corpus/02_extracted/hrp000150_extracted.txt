Im so sick rn and I have never felt so lonely in my life. Yesterday was my bfs birthday and I couldn’t attend. Not once has he texted me first to ask me how I was doing despite knowing I’m sick with fever and headaches. I was the first one to congratulate and ask him how his day was. Not much of answers he had. Today he hasn’t texted me once to ask how I am doing. He also knew that I was alone the whole day yesterday. I have never felt so alone. I feel like he is upset I couldn’t attend his birthday. I feel like I’m not happy in my relationship with him but I’m also not sure because there are days when we are happy and laugh. Can someone help me out? I need a good advice
