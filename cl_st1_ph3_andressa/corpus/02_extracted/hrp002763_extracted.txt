I’m in my mid thirties. I’ve always been somewhat shy but have always had friends and boyfriends. Now that I’m older I’m beginning to realize that I really don’t enjoy being around most people. Maybe it’s my awkwardness, maybe it’s the things I’ve been through in life - but I really just enjoy being alone. Hanging out with my dogs. Reading. Watching videos. Working out. I recently quit drinking which has obviously changed a lot of my relationships and friendships. Everything’s and everyone’s  fun when alcohol is involved. Being sober is a real eye opener. 

I know I’m a little depressed as well, so maybe that is a cause of feeling this way. 

I dont follow social norms, I feel like I was born in the wrong decade. 

Yes I know this post is all over the place. 

Can anyone relate?
