(I translated this text with Deepl because my English isn't very good)

Hi, I'm Eli (14M). A month ago, I was in a group that always met during breaks between classes. But for the past few days, a friend of mine and I have been excluded from activities more often. I already had enough to contend with in terms of depression and existential fears without the group, but now being excluded is only making it worse. Every day, I drag myself out of bed with a smile and try not to completely fall apart. My father works late into the evening and I am alone for half the day. In addition, my mother and father are divorced and I only see them every other weekend. At the moment, I'm looking for friends online in video games and social media. However, most of them don't want anything to do with a child and have their own friends. I don't know yet how I'm going to get through the next few years or how I'm going to live later on in the working world.

I thank everyone who has read this text and hope you don't mind me writing here. Compared to the others who share their problems or fears here, what I am writing here is just nonsense to most people.
