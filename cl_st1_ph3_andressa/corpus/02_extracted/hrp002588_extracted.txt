I'm really just venting here, but I'm annoyed there really isn't anything that caters to nocturnal people (besides clubs, bars, etc). I've got a bunch of conditions that trigger when I'm in the sun or in non-cold temperatures. I'm basically a vampire so I sleep or meditate most of the day and come outside at night. I'll come out for a night walk or jog, and although I do love the night, it's just....really boring. Where I live there's no calisthenic/street workout area and the parks are full of shady people. Maybe it's just the city I'm in really is as bland and lifeless at night as I think it is. 

There's this cool bar called Barcade, which is exactly what it sounds like; a bar and an old-school arcade. It's cool, never crowded, and the atmosphere is really chill, so that's nice, but other than that there's nothing to do. Anyone have any ideas on what to do for fun at night?
