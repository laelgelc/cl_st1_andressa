i find myself at a loss of words trying to find the ones to describe loneliness. it’s cold, colder than icy love or ice cold hatred. and it’s empty, hollow like a long dead tree. i wake up and am filled with regret for even doing so, do you too wish you could sleep forever? not die, but just eternal slumber.

i have people i love, family, friends. but yet no one really knows me, and that’s mostly my fault. i put on a social mask to protect everyone, otherwise it’s too easy to tell how hurt i am. i’m damaged goods man, and that’s fine. 

isolated forever because nothing is as deep. she loved me like no one else has, and i didn’t even get the opportunity to love her back as deeply as she loved me. before i could even immerse myself in something safe and together, it was gone before i could realize. her and our spark sniffed out far too soon, did it have to be this way? it’s fine, i’ll live, but most likely won’t end up loving again, just because why would i?
