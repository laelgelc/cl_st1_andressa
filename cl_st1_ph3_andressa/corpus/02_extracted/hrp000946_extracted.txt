Back in 2018 i just finished 2 year college and was applying for a four year college but since i have no friends or people to talk to i ended up printing out a videogame characters face and taped it to a box to talk too.... I used to not know why, could never make friends. (Nowadays i just accept everyone thinks im an asshole.) Not since bloody kindergarden did i actually have friends. Elementaey school was easy cuz i was a dumb kid, but by highschool it got a little bit hard to just alway hear how xyz gonna do xyz with the crew and have a good time. It was the same in 2 and 4 year college i would be in the mists of the group but i was not invited and it felt too akward to ask. So yeah in 2019 and 2020 i talked to a box. Now post 4 year i have a job and its just that same thing again but now im 28 and im literally watching everyone else go through stages of life not just parties and here i am no one to talk to ive never even been on a date before. While i can count on 1 hand how many special things ive done in a year most people thats just 1 week or less. Id like to think my social situation has improved but it really hasnt 2010 no one to talk to 2015, 2020, 2025 like i do try i do sometime go out but its hard, seeing all those people toegther with friends and loved ones i just feel out of place.

You know your a loser when you get excited that someone at work decided to chat with you for a second.....
