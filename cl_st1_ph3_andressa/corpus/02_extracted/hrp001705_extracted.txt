made this thing where you write a thought on a paper lantern and release it. someone in the world gets it at 9am or 9pm. you don't know who.

no chat. no profile. no way to reply. just one tiny thread between two people who'll never meet.

last night I wrote something really small. nothing deep. just "tomorrow will be better" and I let it go. and I don't know who read it this morning but somehow it helped just to send it.

it's called OneSky [https://thatonesky.com](https://thatonesky.com)

if you're up late and need to get something off your chest, it's there.
