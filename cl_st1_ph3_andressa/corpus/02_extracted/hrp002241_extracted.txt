Waking up to zero notifications is so depressing I feel so lonely and crappy about myself usually I'd hide in my bubble at home but I can't do that because I'm in my final year of uni.


I feel so dead on the inside my brain is just dead.I feel so lonely but it's no use talking to any of my friends cause they don't understand and they can't be a bit disrespectful at times.


And all they wanna do is drink,  smoke and club.Amd tbh it's getting exhausting for me and it's also really expensive.


I wish I had friends that things moderation and were actually genuine.
