I came across someone on instagram, stalked out of boredom, and I just had this thought I wanted to share, hopefully find people similar to me.

After high school, I never knew what I wanted to do, I had no passions, went to a private university for marketing, switched to psychology, dropped out completely because of really bad anxiety (+ not feeling any connection with anyone).

Since then, I took a few online courses, and even a physical one of a week. I’m still not completely sure of anything, but this year I decided that I probably was still not going back to college, I don’t know when I will, if I even will since I pretty much already have what I need to apply to some jobs in my field. 

For now I’ll be focusing on opening my small business and learning other things like cooking, Italian, probably even first aid, and whatever else I grow curious about. I just feel like I’m missing out on the college experience, I’m turning 21 soon, I have 1-2 close friends (but they still have their person), I don’t really enjoy partying unless it’s with people I really vibe with (which I don’t anymore).

I haven’t gone out much since returning from a month long trip, I’m currently looking for a new gym, and I want to try to go out by myself more this year, so I have some hope there. Just feels a little lonely not having a friend group like I saw on this guy’s profile and stories of other people I follow.
