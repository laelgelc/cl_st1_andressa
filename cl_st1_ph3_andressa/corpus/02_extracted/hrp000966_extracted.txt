I have this fear that one of the only friends I go out with doesn’t like to hang out with me anymore but is too polite to say. I always ask to hang out, it’s almost never the other way around. We only ever talk when we see each other in real life, or when I text something.

So I’m trying to go out on my own tomorrow. I feel pretty sad but I’m trying to look at the positive side that at least I can do that. But having so much silence. Looking at my phone constantly with no one really who wants to ask me about my day or anything as much as I ask about theirs.

I’m trying to ignore getting depressed, but being this lonely makes me tired. Drained. When I go to sleep I try to be as vivid as possible to imagine I’m with someone. I have these two people on YouTube that I “watch” movies with because I don’t have anyone in real life to do that with.

At work, everyone is going on vacation. To see their friends and families, with their husbands or wives and kids. Everyone has someone to go home to. I’m always the last to leave, I walk alone and I wait alone for the bus.

My dream is to just have someone see me. And want to know me and talk to me just because they feel like it. I look in the mirror and wonder if maybe I’m too fat, or too ugly, or just too annoying with the things that I like. 

There’s a boy that I think about always who never falls short of finding someone else to be in love with. It makes my heart ache.

I keep trying to keep myself in good spirits thinking that it’s for a reason. But even in my thoughts I’m lonely and have nothing to talk to myself about. I fill my time consuming information and watching shows hoping that I’ll get to talk to someone about it for the day.
