I have more than 10 friends, but right now, I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m waiting for someone to answer my calls or messages, especially the friend I’ve known for over 10 years. Suddenly, they stopped reaching out, and I feel really alone and depressed. I don’t have a girlfriend, my family is far away, and it’s already late at night. I’m just lying on my bed, sad and thinking about how no one seems to care. Honestly, I feel like I’m falling into depression. 
I just wanted to share this with someone... Maybe you are feeling the same as I am right now.
