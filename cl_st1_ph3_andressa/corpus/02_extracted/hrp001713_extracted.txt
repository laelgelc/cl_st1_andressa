Take anything in life, it's always better to be in one of the extremes good or bad, popular or loner, poor or rich. But being in the middle is the worse thing that can happen to anyone. I am someone that's been overlooked, undervalued, taken for granted not cared for much. Is it my fault or fate to be this way. All my life I can't even name one person that's my friend or that knows me well. None. It's just me and the non stop bickering in my head for the 24 years of my life. I see everyone around me have atleast a friend that is close to their heart that loves them for who they are. There are many reasons for someone to not have friends. Either they got a unlikeable character, or they are moody, shy or bad looks (sadly), or maybe even their preference to be alone but I can say i am a humorous, easy moving, empathetic, emotional person.I know looks are subjective but I have not felt insecure about my looks. I always try to make everyone around me happy. I like everyone but I just don't know whether no one cares or stays long enough to get to know me. I have no motivation or happiness in my life. It's just mechanical. That's it. I don't know how to proceed with my life. I know be disciplined, go to gym all that but you need something in life to get that engagement in these things. I have nothing. What do I do?
