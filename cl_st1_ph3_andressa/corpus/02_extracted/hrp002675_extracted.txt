I was hanging out with some close friends. These people are close enough to where we trade "I love you's" when saying goodbye.

It's usually the same circumstances when I am in a social situation. I've noticed throughout my many social encounters. I tend to be popular, well liked, and even considered attractive when people first meet me. After a couple hangouts though it always go the same. They detach so easily. They treat me so harshly. They're mean. 

I'm used to it. You know? It doesn't make me sad. I'll tell you how it does make me feel though and it comes across as a question. 

What makes me this way?

People after talking to me tend to find me untrustworthy, mean, or annoying. 
I don't mean to come across this way. I'll compliment a friend or a friends girlfriend or anyone really and I get a unpleasant response from the whole room. Jokes I make either hit the whole room genuinely or make people upset with me.

I've never had a true friend in my life. No one that stuck by me through the roughest of times.

I have a problem with this because most of what I do for people has been out of my love for them and never with Ill intent because that's not how was raised or how I am. 

My close friends today decided to cut me out of the whole day and proceeded to talk about me while in front of me. (And probably after I left immediately after)

I just honestly want friends but everyone seems to think I have another motive. Such as stealing a girlfriend or using for money, food, or weed when smoking was a thing I enjoyed.

It's okay, I hope one day happiness finds its way to me, it's better to be optimistic about these sort of things I've learned.
