I'm 26. I don't go to clubs, I don't go to anything really! I'm really reclusive.   
I work from home. I don't have co-workers who call or message ever. My job is very isolating and I'm the only person who does my specific job - there is no overlap whatsoever with anyone else.  
Sometimes I wish I had a co-worker type friend to chat with during the day - I want to experience the mundane build up into a friendship. Just like a 9-5 pal who also is in the same boat as I am, maybe? Is there anyone else like that out there? I don't want to give away too much about myself in this post before getting to know anyone - feel free to look at my profile though.
