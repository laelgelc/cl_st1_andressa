As soon as I finish my work and night comes, it gets really hard to sleep. I start feeling extremely lonely, random thoughts keep bothering me, and most of the time I just end up staring at the ceiling.

I try to keep my mind engaged before going to bed, but it still feels like I should talk to someone. And there’s no one. I have a very small circle of friends, and I’m 22 years old.

Does anyone else feel this way at night? How do you manage loneliness when everything goes quiet?

Thanks for reading my random thoughts.
