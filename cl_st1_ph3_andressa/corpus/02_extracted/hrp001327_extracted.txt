Anyone else also yearns for that stereotypical- teenage- friendship bullshit? All i want is to be able to stay up with someone all night, playing ps3 or  on pc, watching old movies, sneaking outside in the night, drinking energy drinks, booze and smoking while discussing books, art or philosophy or just anything. Going to the cinema, theatres, making art projects together. A person that u could trust, someone with a similar mindset and viewpoints. Someone that would help you. Motivate you to be better. Its hard to be on your own in this miserable place.  Idk. When I actually try to commit to a relationship, I just feel drained and dissapointed. I have no energy to socialize. I am aware that im just idealizing .   Its hard for me to find people who actually want to hang out. Im extremely introverted but sometimes I get this strong urge to just turn off my brain and do something fun with someone. I know that if I belonged somewhere, Id still be dissatisfied and Id sabotage myself to cut people off ( happened many times before)  but still. Im not immune to needing connection, no matter how hard I repress my urges. Yeah, merry christmas anyone. You dont need to be happy to have substance abuse sooo.
