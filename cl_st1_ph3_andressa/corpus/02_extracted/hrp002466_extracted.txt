Bombarded in debt, no one to depend on, never got along with anyone at school, have a useless degree, stuck working some wage slave garbage barely surviving living paycheck to paycheck hoping I don't get fired. I had to inherit all of my dad's problems when he passed, including his medical debt, so the bloodline ends with me. I'm never having kids because the last thing i want them to do is to inherit all of my suffering and have to struggle like me for things they never asked for. Didn't think this life would be this much of a sick joke, but day after day it becomes more clear
