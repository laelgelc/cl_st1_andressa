20M. I hopped onto this place to maybe try and make friends and meet people to help with social isolation issues. I'm now through 20 people who have left on read, randomly blocked, or just left.

I dont get it, what did I do? I try to be respectful and polite and decent but it doesnt seem to matter. I understand I can talk alot but I try to even hold that back. Why are people like this? Did I do something? Do I just have insanely bad luck?

I just want company that stays even if it has to pretend.
