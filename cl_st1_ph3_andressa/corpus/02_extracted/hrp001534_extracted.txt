I’ve decided to cut myself off from the few friends I have, I haven’t been really feeling like myself throughout this year. A lot of bad emotional decisions, and somehow I’m just wishing for someone to reach over which it’s petty but is how I feel. I do enjoy being alone, I don’t enjoy the reasons why I am alone.
