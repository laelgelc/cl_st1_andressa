i really want to make new friends in the city but i genuinely am so awkward im afraid people would look and point and laugh at me if i showed up to a bar alone with a book or something ive never done that before but i dont know what other ways i can be in public to ween myself onto socialization i feel like im meant to be an awkward spinster for the rest of my life or something
