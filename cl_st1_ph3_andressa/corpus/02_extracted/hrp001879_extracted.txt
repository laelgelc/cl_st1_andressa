i can only imagine people have been through way worse. and i can also imagine if i had gotten autism diagnosed, gotten grief therapy, my mental health properly treated, dbt and cbt therapy… things wouldnt have turned out so bad. its crazy how your life can be in the hands of others but now that im 19 its like my life is meaningless. i didnt make my circumstances this bad, i tried my best to survive being dragged from two continents across the world from each other multiple times. but it hurts me that all i could find comfort in was in toxic places that led to my toxic self inflicted behaviour. things never should’ve been this bad. and i hate to say it but my family failed me.
