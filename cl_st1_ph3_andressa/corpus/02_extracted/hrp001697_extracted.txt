I pray that one day someone chooses me that one day someone will feel for me the way I feel about them that I’m not just another passer by in the way that I’m not just some background character in there life

Why me?

Am I so unloveable?

Is it because I’m disinteresting?

Am I boring do I bore them?

Am I not funny?

Is it because I’m quiet and can’t think of things to say?

I’m pathetic 

Is it because of what I’ve done?

Is it punishment for my failings and transgressions?

Why not me

Why 

Why am I the one left out 

Am I doomed to be forever all

Why, is it wrong for me to want someone who I can actually feel for 

Love

I just don’t get it

I know miracles don’t fall out the sky but it does for others

Why not me

Why

I should be happy

But I’m not 

Why can’t I find my one 

And feel trapped in my mind of understanding 

I like her

I really do

She’s pretty 

She’s cool

I like how she loves music

How she does a British accent when she’s nervous 

The way she smiles

How her presence is just enchanting 

How when I’m around here time doesn’t matter

When she hugs me I just melt away 

How her voice soothes my ears

Why do I bother

Maybe I’m not meant to be happy

Maybe I never was

Why

Why
