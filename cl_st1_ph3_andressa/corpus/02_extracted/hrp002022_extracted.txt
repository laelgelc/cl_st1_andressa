What the title says. Have any of you made a friend on Reddit? For the sake of this conversation let’s say “friend” is a platonic acquaintance that you regularly communicate with. So, we aren’t talking about looking for hookups, or sending creepy DMs. Don’t get me started on the DMs. I’m genuinely shocked by some of the stuff people will say to someone they just have met. I used to get excited when I got a new DM, not so much anymore. But back on track.

In theory it seems like it should work. I mean, in this case “lonely” is the name of the subreddit. I would think that surely lonely people are finding friends here just from proximity to other lonely people. But my experience and observation seem to suggest that isn’t the case.

But maybe it’s me. I’m well past the average age on reddit, and I don’t have great social skills, so maybe you guys are having better success. This isn’t me venting, I’m genuinely curious.

Have you made a friend on reddit?

Or maybe I’m not even asking the right question. Are people looking for friends on Reddit? Do we want more friends? Or do we just want to complain about not having enough? Those are not sarcastic questions; I’m trying not to make assumptions.
