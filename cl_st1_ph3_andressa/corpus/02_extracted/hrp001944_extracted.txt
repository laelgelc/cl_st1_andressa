M29. I’ll stay quiet for days. No friends not even acquaintances. Almost no contact with family, they’ll reach out when in need of sm.

I don’t have the time or energy to join more clubs/social stuff no one ever follows through.

Only thing that keeps me sane is academia, PhD, multiple masters but who cares, not worth it, wasted so much time. I’ve got no one to talk to about anything.

It was either that or nothing, my 9-5 was killing my spirit, it still does.

Is it going to be like this forever? I try to convince myself I’m ready for that but… 50+ years of this… dunno.
