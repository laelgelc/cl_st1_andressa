It’s 1 AM, and I’m in this quiet forest, alone with my thoughts. Life often feels empty and lonely. I see others sharing moments of happiness... spending time with loved ones, enjoying life’s simple pleasures... while I find myself disconnected and searching for meaning. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone truly sees me or cares. I've shared my struggles before, and honestly, life has sometimes felt like a series of hardships, teaching me lessons of pain rather than joy. The weight of loneliness and depression is heavy....like a shadow that never quite leaves me. I try to escape the darkness, even if just for a moment, but it never fully leaves me.

Right now, I’m in a quiet forest, alone with my thoughts, writing this out of a deep sense of solitude. Life was brighter during school and college, when everything seemed full of possibility. But as I grew older, I chased success and money, only to find myself a slave to them... losing touch with happiness and genuine connection. I left behind a promising career at a big tech company to pursue my own venture, which grew but at a personal cost. The pursuit of success stole something precious from me: my joy. And despite all the achievements, I still feel empty inside....like I’ve lost the essence of who I am.

Life feels fleeting, a brief chapter in the grand scheme. We spend so much of it working, earning, surviving... rules seemingly set to keep us busy but disconnected from what truly matters. Despite having stability, I still feel the ache of loneliness, of being unseen and unheard. Sometimes I visit cemeteries, reading the names, contemplating the brevity of life... some left too soon, others lived fully. I wonder about those lives, about the chances I never took to truly connect or understand. It’s painful to think how fleeting it all is, how quickly it’s gone.

In complete isolation, I share this here, hoping to find a little relief. Thank you for listening.
