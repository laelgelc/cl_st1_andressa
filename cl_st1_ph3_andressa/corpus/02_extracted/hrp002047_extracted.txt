I’m second semester in college. I’m not lonely in the sense I don’t know anyone, I’m just not in a friend group.

I talk to people in class and my clubs, and my job, but I don’t see the in the evenings or hangout. 

The only person I’m really friendly with and hangout with is my roommate.

I’m pretty introverted and I guess I just didn’t put myself out there as much during orientation.

I’m just sad that I’m cooked and can’t get into a friend group. They all seem to be doing such fun things over the weekend. But like I can’t just walk up to them and be like, hey let me hang out with you. 

Idk I’m js sad.
