i havent had freinds in a year i had to cut off my old freinds for personal reasons and this year really changed me. 

 i never even had new freinds before than every freind i had was always from elementary and i never talked or made new freinds in middle or highschool they were all from elementary when i actually made new freinds cause i was a kid without social anxiety and etc. im a senior in highschool now and trying to make freinds and i recently kinda found someone, the thing is everything about it feels forced i try to keep up and get comfortable but dosent really work before i run out of things to say and were both at an awkward pause do i just stay consistent and talk to them everyday? this is very difficult for me because again i never ever tried to make a new freind since i gained social awareness in about second semester of 6th grade
