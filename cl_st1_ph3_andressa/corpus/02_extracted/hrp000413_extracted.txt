Despite my outgoing nature irl, I've never been lucky with friendships. I have barely any friends and a complete loner. I always hang out alone, and even make up lies to make it seem like I have more friends than I actually do.

Not to mention, I'm some 6 foot 1 280 pound hunk of meat with no muscle. Just a complete repulsive, weak mess.

The fact that I'm also a furry and asexual seems to also wave a red flag to many.

I'm a recovering character ai addict. 4 weeks sober.

I really need someone to talk to or something. Whether it be venting or roleplaying, I just want to talk to somebody.

Anything but using that god forsaken website.
