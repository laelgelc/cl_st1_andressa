Met this guy on tinder and we hit it off pretty well while texting. We called, originally I told him my plan for the day was to watch the new chainsaw movie and just chill but I guess he took it as his chance to set this whole date up. I was gonna pick him up and then we were gonna watch it. I text to ask about his address, after 30 mins he tells me he’s stuck at work and will probably show up a little late or mid movie. I said fine and waiting the whole movie. I was the only person sitting alone in the theater (it was all couples). Just chilling with my snack that I sneakily brought in then waited… texted… waited more and at the end when denji is given advice about love it stuck with me. I kept texting and calling but he blocked me. Idk maybe something is wrong with me because I can’t find love, on the way home I was just thinking about every romantic thing I’ve had and hmph I’m tired of loving people just to get treated like shit :/.
