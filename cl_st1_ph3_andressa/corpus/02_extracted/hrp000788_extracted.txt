Left my abusive X five months ago. All that I had was my car, 2 laundry baskets of clothes, a few personal effects, 40 bucks, and my dog. I have since relocated 4 states away, got a full time job, just rented a 2 bedroom house, furnished it, and live a brand new life. I did it on my own. I met some wonderful people along the way. I speak to no one, including family, from my "old" life. I'm lonely. I just want to cuddle up with another human, watch Netflix, order junk food from Door dash, and be...but not be alone. I want to cook dinner for someone. Take care of someone. Do someone's laundry. Celebrate the small victories. Wake up not alone. Idk. I'm watching a movie, after a long day, on my couch, alone...I'm sad. Like Schroedinger's cat...do I even exist?
