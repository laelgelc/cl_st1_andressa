im super dopped on seizure meds but im really hurting. im so spaced out i dont even know how to sleep. i feel like really betrayed. i was supposed to be admitted to neurology and then they just decised no bc one blood test clearing, even tho obviously it clears up with the stuff they gave me. idk. i feel worthless. i feel like nothing will ever get better. i wanna disappear offline instead of fixating on my phone when im burnt out and bed ridden id rather just be nothing. i do have no one anyways. i could really use some words of encouragement or positive or reassurance. i just need to know the world isnt out to isolate me in agony to a bedroom forever.
