I'm 20F and I have never had real friends who seem like they like me. I've had plenty who shut me down and argue with me, plenty who liked me because I was pretending to not be me, but I don't feel like I've ever had a real friend. I think I'm just too much to deal with. I have BPD and autism so I just feel like everything hurts so bad and nobody can ever understand it and I can never understand them. I think maybe if I really tried, like lost weight, got contacts, wore more makeup, dressed more normal, took out my septum ring and all that, people might be able to at least pretend they know me and like me. I'm just so frustrated.
