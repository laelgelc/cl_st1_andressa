I feel disconnected to my family. I try to be the loving supportive father and husband. I love my family but I built a lot of resentment. Before I get into why I had resentment I should explain a few things. One my wife and I have been together for 25 years… wow just typing that out feels heavy. She is chronically ill with many autoimmune issues, including Ehlers danlos syndrome, Reynard syndrome, a spina bifida Oculta, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome. IBS. We have four kids that are living with us 23 15, 13 and eight. All of them have some form of special needs the older three are high functioning and with Reminders and guidance they can function on their own. Our youngest is nonverbal autistic level three.

 I am a father of four for the last 16 years I have been the sole breadwinner. For at least the last 5 I have done 90 percent of the cooking and cleaning. When I ask for help I am asking too much. If I ask my wife not to sleep till noon and have breakfast or a coffee together I am asking too much. 

I feel my purpose is to take care of everything and  don’t disagree with my wife and don’t ask my kids to do anything. How the fuck did my life get like this ? Work is my vacation. I feel liked and respected hell my opinions matter at work. But at home I feel like a glorified servant. This is not a poor me but a reflection of my thought process. 

To feel good mentally I work out 2-3 times a week for mental and emotional health. So I am not angry or depressed when I get off work I sneak away a quick joint. I want to be happy without having to relay on weed.  I am not depressed or having suicidal thoughts. I see no reason for self harm or hurting others. But I am tired of doing it all. I am tired of feeling silenced. Forgive the rant.
