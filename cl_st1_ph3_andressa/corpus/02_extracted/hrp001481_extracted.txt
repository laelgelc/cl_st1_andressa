Today I woke up after a very strange dream I heard a call from someone that someone was shouting my name it was a female voice and when I started to run where I heard the voice the woman kept disappearing finally I managed to find her the woman was having a very strong panic attack I just stayed next to her first without knowing what to do then I was hugging her she was a total stranger to me but I woke up with a very strange feeling after this dream someone has had a similar experience the truth is I usually dream about strangers but such an intense dream has never happened to me
I hope the translation is okay because I am writing in Spanish using voice dictation.
