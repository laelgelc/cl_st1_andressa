Like the title says I feel melancholic all the time and think about the times, and how much better they were. And the thing is there were times that were better, but most of the time it was worse, so why do I feel like this, and can’t appreciate my time right now? When I talk with my friend about this they always say that I should live in the moment but I’m can’t do that im constantly worried about the future and I constantly miss the past. I hate it the constant feeling of the past being better and that I’m much lonelier now.
