NAW. I just need to vent mostly

Even after trying new hobbies, meeting different people, I don't find anything as interesting anymore. 

I recently stopped seeing this guy because he wasn't who I was looking for in a partner even if I'd be all alone again, and I'm just done at this point. I want to give up. How long do we keep repeating the same shit cycle of trial and error? Maybe I'm not cut out for that adversity to actually find someone

I know we're all alone by the end of the day and we should be used to it by now, that we should 'love ourselves' first. But I still want connection, I still want the intimacy. I want to come home to someone by the end of day. Is it too much now to ask? Waiting kills. 

At this point if I was just meant to be alone in this lifetime, just remove my desire for connection at this point.

Either I try to reflect for myself or try not to think about it too much, days go back and forth in a blur between distracting myself or keeping busy at work. Yet it just lingers in the back of my head.  I've been alone for most of my life, how much self-work and self-love do we have to do?

Then I remember it's all about luck anyways.

But I'm still scared of being alone the whole way.
