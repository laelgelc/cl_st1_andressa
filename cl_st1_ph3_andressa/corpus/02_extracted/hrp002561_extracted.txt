Lately im always hauted by this feeling of lonelyness. I feel like i dont have anyone to talk to about my feelings. Im basically like a shut-in and have no one irl to talk about even talking to my parents feel weird. My lifes just been online same person daily playing games with them over and over again with peple i barely know. Sometimes when i think about it it hits me hard that i got nobody to genuinely hangout with it kinda sucks but i only have one person who i really talk with and that is my gf whom i met online through minecraft. Is there anything i can do to break this cycle?
