The title is oversimplifying this, but i think it’s the best way to put this. 

For context, i’m a first year college student. I’m starting my second semester, and i realized over winter break that i’m not really that close to anyone else in my friend group, even though they all live in the same dorm as me, and we do a decent amount of stuff together.

they kinda leave me out a little, and i always felt like they were all closer to each other than i was.

I recently have been trying for the past 2 weeks to try to connect, through talking more through text and trying to be around them more. 

welp, that resulted in 2 separate people pulling me aside and telling me that i was acting much too friendly for how close i actually was, that i was not part of their inner bubble, and that i had not really been there when they built bonds with each other, and now i was just forcing myself in. (that is true, even though i was going through a lot then, i definitely neglected our friendships) and digitally, it’s not much better, i’m lucky if they even respond.

i really didn’t mean to be so clingy & miss their social cues like that, i think they’re all really cool people and i want to be closer with them, especially since i don’t really have friends outside of this group, though i’ve been trying to branch out more.

i just don’t know what to do now. any  

advice?
