I don’t like how I feel left behind by my “friends”. They’re all getting boyfriends, opportunities, and more happiness than me. I’m just sad because they found things to pursue, hobbies to do, and things to keep them busy, while I’m just in my sweats upstairs, watching anime and k-dramas, and binge-eating, and on Reddit too. I want to do more, but I can’t. I’m also very dejected today because I burnt my eggs this morning.... :(
