I fell like people join here because they mix being a loner means you are lonely. That's completely false being a loner means you're accepting to be with oneself for however long you wish to be 2 decompress breathe think about your future it's honestly a good thing but many people think it's a bad thing it's not the thing is that social media and media in general push out for people to see that you must have social life in able to actually feel happy. I once thought that was true but as I got older and found out that completely false it's okay to have a handful of friends to check in on occasion but you can be a loner and enjoy life as it is. go outside walking the woods be one with nature or look up to the stars and feel in a moment of wonder by yourself it's a good feeling. so if anybody says that you're weird for being a loner don't pay any attention to them don't even give what they said second thought just continue with your life and breathe and feel calm and peace.
