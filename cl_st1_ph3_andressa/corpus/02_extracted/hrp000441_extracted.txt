Hi everyone,

I’m a 34-year-old man and recently separated from my ex. We have an 18-month-old child together.

This New Year’s Eve, I’m at home alone with our child, while my ex is out celebrating with her new partner. I fully accept that we’re no longer together and that both of us have the right to move on. There’s no open conflict between us, and co-parenting is generally respectful.

Still, I’m experiencing very mixed emotions tonight. On one hand, I’m grateful to be with my child and I know these moments matter. On the other hand, there’s loneliness, a bit of sadness, and maybe even a feeling of being left behind while life seems to move on for her.

I’m not looking to blame anyone, and I’m not saying she’s doing anything wrong. I’m more interested in understanding my own feelings and hearing different perspectives.

How would you feel in this situation?

Is this a normal emotional reaction after a separation with a child involved?

Any advice on how to deal with nights like this in a healthy way?

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any honest thoughts.
