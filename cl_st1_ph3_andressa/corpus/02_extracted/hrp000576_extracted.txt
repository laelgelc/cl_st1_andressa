I feel so alone and in my own small world, all of my friends feel distant and no one wants to fucking talk to me. I don't think im ugly or repulsive, and i havent done anything evil. Im not a creep or a stalker, i'm literally a normal fucking teen. I just want to get rid of everything that comes to mind when i hear about the future or even the past and present. I hate my life and I'm tempted to starve myself so ppl will pay attention to me. I already cut myself and try to make it a little visible so people will ask and FUCKING TALK TO ME. I just need someone to be here for me and help me make choices ig.. I feel so tired all the time, I just need to not be in control. idk. this is embarrassing to post.
