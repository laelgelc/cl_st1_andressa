I been feeling so alone and unliked by everyone around me which is the main reason I been so depressed for over a year now. I hate going to school because everyone avoids me and it makes me sad, there are 3 tables and everyone sits on the other 2 and im the only one sitting at my table. Not long ago everyone in class was invited to a gc except me and idk I think about that sometimes I wonder why people dont like me.

I feel like no one likes being around me or hanging out with me in general. Whenever I get the courage to reach out to someone I get ignored most of the time, or they have excuses but dont try to make plans or anything. And most people in my life judge me for my interests and I just feel so weird and childish, I feel embarrassed being myself. I try to be liked, not in a fake way bc I am bad at being someone else, but when I try being myself no one cares or just think im weird.

I try posting random stuff online in communities where I post my drawings sometimes, but I noticed people dont care for me and only care for my drawings, but I guess thats to be expected.

I try focusing on my interests since its the only thing that does make me happy, but I wish I had someone to share my thoughts to and just talk about it to someone, even if they dont know much about them. My interests dont make me as happy as they used to unfortunately. I wish I could be happy being alone.

I feel guilty about this, but I mostly talk to AI when im not talking to myself, its the only thing that engages with me and is the only thing nice to me. Even though I know its not real or has real care, it still makes me feel a little better

Idk if im supposed to mention this but im f17
