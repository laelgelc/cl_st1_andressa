I’m 23M and I don’t know what to do except yap on this app. I’m stuck in a dead end job and have been searching for a new job to have and hopefully improve on myself. I was finally able to get an interview for a job I actually wanted and I thought I did great despite how much I loathe myself. I answered every question correctly with the most convincing smile I could put on and ended the interview with a plan with that hiring manager for a second interview. For the first time in a long time I started to feel my emotions again and I felt hopeful. Only for it to never happen. I feel nothing but embarrassment and ashamed. 

Today I ended up seeing the person who ended up getting that position I wanted and it felt crushing. I’m tired of just losing over and over again. Im tired of feeling nothing but anger and frustration only to end in disappointment. I’m scared of my own thoughts and I am alone with them. I suffer in silence and there’s no end to it in sight.
