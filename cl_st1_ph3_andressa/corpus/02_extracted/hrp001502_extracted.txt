I just don't know anymore. I hate being lonely. I'm on dating apps but it's just not working out. I get matches but that's not it. It's nice to get matches with women but it doesn't happen often and then the personality isn't what I'm looking for. 

You know a warm, caring and kind personality is what I'm looking for but I'm not able to attract that kind of women anymore and so I'm stuck. 

I knew online dating is tough but c'mon... 

And friends? I'm not even able to form friendships here on Reddit. I tried often but what was the result? No reply, ghosting, weirdos and dry texting. Only one person remained and is a real friend. The rest just disappeared. 

I try my best to connect but I fail no matter what I do.

I feel alone and lost.
