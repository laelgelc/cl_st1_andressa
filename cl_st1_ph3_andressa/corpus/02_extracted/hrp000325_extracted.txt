I’m struggling and I don’t have any friends is the truth… I’m a twenty year old female. I know I should be living it up or calling my girls but I’ve never had female friends that like me unless it was romantically. And the guys I used to hangout with sort of get a little carried away with the friendship side of things whenever I hangout with them anymore. I get they have hormones. But I just want someone to talk to me without having underlying intentions I suppose. I apologise for rambling. I’m just feeling sort of lost today.
