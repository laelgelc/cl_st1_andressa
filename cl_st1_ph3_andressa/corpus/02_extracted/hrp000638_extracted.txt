ENGLISH: It’s been more than two months since we last talked. The last chat we had was when we fought… after that, we just exchanged Diwali and Dussehra wishes ...and then complete silence. He’s not my boyfriend, he’s my best friend. I was just asking for 2 minutes of his time… that’s all. We never talk on calls because he’s always busy, so I started texting ...but now even replies come after days, sometimes not at all.

I keep wondering… has he not opened WhatsApp for so long? Or is it just me he’s ignoring? It hurts. Because from outside, I look like a happy person .. smiling, joking, living normally. But inside… I’m not okay. His texts don’t come anymore, nor his calls. Maybe he’s really done with me.

Many times, I open our chat thinking to message him again… but then I read our last texts, and stop myself. 💔

HINDI: It’s been more than two months now… last time we talked was when we fought. After that, just Diwali and Dussehra wishes ....and then silence. He’s not my boyfriend, he’s my best friend. I was just asking for 2 minutes of his time… bas 2 minute. We don’t talk on calls because he’s always busy, so I started texting him. Pehle reply aata tha, ab 2–3 din baad ya kabhi nahi aata.

Kabhi kabhi lagta hai... kya usne itne dino se WhatsApp bhi nahi khola? Ya sirf mujhe ignore kar raha hai? It really hurts… kyunki from outside, I look like a happy person... always smiling, joking, living normally ....but inside, I’m not okay. Ab na uska text aata hai, na call. Maybe he’s really done with me.

Har baar sochta hoon “chalo message kar deta hoon,” but phir last ke messages padhta hoon… aur ruk jaata hoon. 💔
