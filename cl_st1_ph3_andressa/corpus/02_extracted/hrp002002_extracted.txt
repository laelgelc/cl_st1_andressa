A little over a year ago I joined Meetup and started going to events. I put myself out there and started talking to people and pushed myself to join a gym group. From there I would start building friendships and it’s lead to me getting a whole new group of close friends. 

I know it can be hard and Meetup isn’t always active in various areas, but it’s an idea I want to put out there. I didn’t know about Meetup until late 2024 and I’ve gained a lot from it. Plus the app is free. I hope others on here give it a shot and can make connections.
