I'm 17, in high school, supposedly the best years of my life, but I feel so disconnected from reality and the people around me. I feel like I can't laugh or have conversations with people without being superficial. I can't make friends because I feel disconnected from everyone around me, and we're all so different. I isolate myself because the people I talk to don't interest me, and I find most people's behavior so absurd that sometimes I feel like they don't even exist and I'm going crazy. If anyone has any suggestions on how to make friends or any philosophy at all, I'm just going crazy, I don't know what to do. Thank you.
