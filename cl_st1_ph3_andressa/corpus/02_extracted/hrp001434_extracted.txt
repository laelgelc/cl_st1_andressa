now don't get me wrong, i understand that loving yourself and being there for yourself is very important, but atp it just pisses me off. a few days ago i vented to my friends how i felt lonely and all that stuff and my friend told me that being alone is good, it's freeing, i gotta love myself yadda yadda. and i was like... okay, yeah, i get it, fine, but i also just want to share this love with someone else?? like is it bad that i yearn, that i'm not nonchalant, i feel to much, i want to share my life with someone, i don't want to be alone?? i don't want to live alone, i don't want to only love myself, this shit is boring and sucks. i just want to connect with someone, hide under their ribcage, i crave human touch, i crave understanding, i crave love that is impossible to give myself. i want to exist for someone, not just for myself, this gives my life meaning. sharing that meaning. two-hearts beating, living and loving together. or do i just lose aura points because i do not want a single life?
