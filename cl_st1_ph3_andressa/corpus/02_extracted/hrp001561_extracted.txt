hi everybody! (I'm quite new to reddit so i'm soooo sorry if this isn't the way to use it haha) But I have been doing some research for a project as of late about "loneliness" and thought this could be the perfect place to solve some questions i have stumbled upon in the research! questions like:" what are some of the times/ occasions that you feel lonely the most" (or with specific times do you remember) and "is there a difference between loneliness and being alone or even feeling alone?"

As somebody who also struggles with feeling alone sometimes, i do believe that maybe our loneliness can connect us in a way, it is after all such a human experience! So If there are any people who would like to be interviewed or would just like to chat that would be appreciated greatly!
