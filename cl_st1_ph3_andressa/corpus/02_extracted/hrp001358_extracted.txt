Does anyone else have experience of being stung by narcissist after narcissist? This has been in the form of parent, friends, lovers, and when you realise what is happening you say oh it can't be happening again! It's like a living nightmare that I can't escape from, I have endured so much emotional trauma that's its left me completely alone and miserable. I have no friends whatsoever, at least no one that I can call or text to say I need you can we do something. It's so tiring 😢
