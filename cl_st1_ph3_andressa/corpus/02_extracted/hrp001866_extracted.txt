Right now I'm living a pretty lonely life and i dont have many hobbies either, only listening to music and sleep. Sometimes i play video games or watch something, but it's not really making my life feel better or more comfortable as i kind of force myself to do it to pass the time. i'm working a full time job right now, not really happy either, but atleast i'm at peace being alone during my break. The pay is also kind of decent, so I can't complain too much. Then theres only one friend i have, who is also generally busy, so we meet once or twice over several months and making friends feels impossible as i already tried multiple times by joining my friend's friend group or participate in social events. Just standing there and say little or nothing cause my knowledge and interests are limited. As if there was anyone else out there who shares exactly my interests. Feel like im only living for my family,

And im not even sure if i want to wait for something happen, cause thats kind of unlikely but the thought of being selfish for disappearing and making my family worry is worse
