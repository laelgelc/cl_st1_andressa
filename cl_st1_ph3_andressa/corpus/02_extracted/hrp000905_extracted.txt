Title.  
I have no friends and I've been alone for years. I'm starting to feel effects of it. Idk if it's a gen z thing because so many are anti-social and leave you the second they get bored. Anybody here have a similar experience? I just hate seeing shit online about people like Luigi Mangione or serial killers, even they had friends! But why can't I? Am I really that unlovable? I guess so.
