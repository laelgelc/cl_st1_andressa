I’m 42

I’m a introverted autistic woman with ADHD 

I’m different 

I have a dark sense of humor 

I’m sensitive 

I have decided to feel my feelings and I cry often 

I miss my ex/best friend a lot 

I don’t know if I will someone who is like him 

I have worked on myself and he wants nothing to do with me 

Trying to keep myself distracted 

It sucks knowing I will never get married because I’m too fucking different 

It’s really hard for me to connect and feel seen

I feel like I have to make peace with that the only warm body that I will sleep next to will be a cat. Not like that’s bad,it’s just…..lonely.
