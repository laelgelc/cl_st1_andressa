have a nice job, that I enjoy.  have friends, but most of them left me. just spend most of my time reading and in the gym. just got out of a relationship in August. not sure what to do. feeling sad. I don’t have bpd, but the tendencies feel real. I’m considering getting a SB, but idk if it’s worth it when I’m feeling this way. any suggestions on what to do? whenever I’ve been alone I’ve always connected with someone else via dating app or social media etc. I don’t think that’s health. this is the first time I’ve never done that. it feels weird. I’ve felt lonely even when using others but now it feels scary, since I’m not doing that. I feel selfdestructive. I feel like I wanna go to a rave and do dr\^gs to feel something, I don’t think that’s good tho. I like raves tho.
