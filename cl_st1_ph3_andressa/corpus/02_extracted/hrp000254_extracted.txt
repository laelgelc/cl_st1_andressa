I haven't been in love in 9 years, and obviously that didn't work out. For that time, it seemed like it would go somewhere, I felt so warm being around her, and whole. I don't know if I remember what it felt like; it's been so long. I often use the comparison that the memory is like a worn out VHS tape. I got back from my camping trip yesterday. It was in the middle of nowhere; just me and my best friend drinking vodka around the campfire and smoking a few Marlboros while listening to Viktor Tsoi. I talked with a friend over the phone who's in my same situation, 23 and never been kissed or even held hands. It was nice being in the middle of nowhere, but I wanted snow, that's why I went in January. I want a woman to go on these types of trips with and who'd share in my hobbies and I'd share in hers and who loves me. I don't want to 'settle down' or 'start a family', fuck that.
