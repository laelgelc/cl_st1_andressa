I am a loner I just done seem to fit in with the rest of the world. People seem to only wanna be around me in small doses. I don't know what is so unlovable about me. But I am who I am and I accepted this lonely existence. The one thing I cling to honestly is that one day it will all be over and won't matter. And I'd prefer to just be forgotten. I don't care about a legacy or any of that. I'd prefer to be alone rather than change who I am just to fit in with society. I have Tourette syndrome, adhd, ocd,  and a mirage of other neurological and metal problems. So I know I'll probably never find that special someone willing to put up with me. Just to be clear I in no way am condoning ending it I am simply saying that I'm glad I'm mortal and this won't last forever.
