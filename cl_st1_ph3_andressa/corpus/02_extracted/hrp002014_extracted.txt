You obviously don't just talk to random people and then you're buddy buddy. There's always some kind of feel out phase where you're trying to figure out who they are. I realize part of my loneliness is because I'm just viewed as a stranger in other people's eyes and when you're a stranger you don't really mean anything to them yet.
