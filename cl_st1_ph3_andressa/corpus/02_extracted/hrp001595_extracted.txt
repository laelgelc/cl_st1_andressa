Hi I'm Wren I'm 15 and I've been ghosted three times by three people and dumped for another girl once. I don't understand how men can so easily just drop you in the trash like an empty soda can. Do they not have any care at all for my feelings when they do these things? My most recent bf seemed like the one, even though we're young. Then, I called him just now and suddenly got a notification that I had to have him friended to do so. I added him and it said that user doesnt exist. And now i cannot see his bio or anything. Plain and simple, he ghosted me. This has become a pattern with the guys I date. They talk about the future, say they love me, etc. then the moment I'm attached they leave. Why?
