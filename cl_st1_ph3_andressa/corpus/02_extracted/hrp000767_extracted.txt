I have been in and out of relationships my whole life but still kept my independence throughout them. My last relationship ended about three months ago and I was constantly thinking I’ll never find love and that they were the only one for me. And I almost dwell in that sadness of the possibility of never finding love again.

I went on a solo trip an hour away from home and went to a haunted house by myself for the first time in my life over the last 24 hours. I’ve done a solo trip to a concert before, and small ones here and there, but never one overnight and that far from my home where I live by myself.

I was extremely nervous and it ended up turning out to become one of the best experiences of my life. I felt my true self showing and radiating as I lessened my concern of what others might think. It was my night for me and I was there to have a good time.

On the way home I had a friend call me for relationship advice. I can’t recall many times in my life where people have done this. And my first thought was “you know none of them have worked out right? Why would you be asking me for advice?” But I heard him out and it was almost another version of my last relationship. Needing change to happen but holding on because you have faith in your partner and because that is who you want to spend your life with, and deciding your limit. I was reminded of how painful that was to go through everyday. And I suddenly felt so thankful and relieved it was over. That everyday I choose to keep him blocked, that I choose myself, and I’m on my journey to finding peace.

I have hope that I will find what I want one day. And I know the lonely feeling won’t stop. And I know I’ll face so many difficult nights feeling it. But I never want to question myself, my life, or my choices over another person again.
