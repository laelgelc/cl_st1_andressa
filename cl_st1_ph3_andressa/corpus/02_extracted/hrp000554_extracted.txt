As the title says im so lonely.

I recently broke up with my longterm boyfriend he was my best friend but we both decided it was best to become strangers again. 

He was the person i told everything to he was my routine, my safe person where i went to with my problems, the one i laughed with the most its safe to say he was the light in my dark life. I know that sounds so dramatic, but in short ill tell you this ive always had a difficult house hold so i cant hold normal convos with my family dont want affection from them dont expect comfort yk the things people usually get out of families. 

I am so lonely, i have 2 people in my life now since i broke up with him.

Person 1. We basically bonded over our relationships because our boyfriends were friends well me and her are both single now so nothing to talk about anymore. We also barely see eachother even if we at the same uni our timetables dont match at all.

Person 2. I text i barely get an answer, we grew apart and he focuses on other things which i dont blame him for at all, my point is cant really call it friendship anymore

So yes im at uni "time of my life" as people tell me, well not for me. Like in highschool over always struggled to make of maintain friendships,  partly because im awkward not the most social person and just i am bad at it idk why it has always been that way it takes a certain type of person to be with me longterm.

Well at uni i told myself im gonna be open to meeting new people no judgement imma just go for it, well or the person is fun at first but then becomes annoying to me or we exchange socials and then never talk again, or they literally walk past me and sit somewhere else. 
Yes ive tried starting convos sitting next to them etc. 

Its just i go to school alone.
 i sit in class alone. I eat my lunch alone. And go home alone. In a whole day i talk to not one person or its a very quick convo, i feel so out of place all the time like what is my point of being here?
