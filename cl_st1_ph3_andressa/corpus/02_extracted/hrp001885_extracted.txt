This week, I’m traveling for work for a week long work meeting/training. I appreciate that I’m able to learn more about different roles in the company and how they function but as usual, my social anxiety gets in my way of getting more out of experiences. When its time to talk socially and network with others, I struggle to overcome it. I feel so much emotional pain. Today, I went with my department team out for dinner after the meetings. While everyone was talking, I was the only silent and looked out of place. The situation was very overwhelming. Not the first I felt like that this week or at any other time in my life. This is why I don’t have any friends or go out all on own time. I can’t handle these situations. At the end of this week, there will be an awards dinner and I heard a dance floor after it. I am dreading it.
