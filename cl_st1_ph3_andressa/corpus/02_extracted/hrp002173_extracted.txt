Everyone seems to be living a better life. Everyone has at least someone. I live alone, I work alone. I have no family at all. Any friends I do have, are all having families and getting married. I have told 2 friends I feel lonely recently and no one cares. No one even says anything. They all have their own lives to live, I understand that. 

It’s just so heavy sometimes, I feel like I can’t bare the weight of crushing loneliness anymore. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I have tried so hard to be ok on my own.

My last ex gave me herpes, he didn’t tell me he had it and decided he didn’t want me anyway. He’s taken any chance at a better life away from me. No one will want to be with me now. I am falling behind, watching everyone I know drift further and further away. I am happy for people to have so much love in their lives but I can’t help but feel sad. I really need a hug.
