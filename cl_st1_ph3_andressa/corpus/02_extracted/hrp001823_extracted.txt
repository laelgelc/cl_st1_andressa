For some time now, I’ve been trying to meet people I can actually have meaningful exchanges with. However, most of the people I encounter quickly turn out to be some form of fascist, racist, or bigot, which makes genuine connection feel impossible.

During the pandemic, it at least felt easier to find interesting people online, but now even that seems rare.

Am I the only one feeling this way?
