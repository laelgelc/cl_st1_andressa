Last November I was completely ghosted by my boyfriend of 5 years when I was going through a very hard phase in life. (Granted I texted him a long paragraph of how I loved him so much and as my last act of love I will let him go if he was constantly unhappy with me. But he didn't even grace me with a response and immediately completly vanished from my life.) I haven't felt myself since then. I have this emptiness inside of me that I am not able to fully explore so that I can even begin to try to fill it. I truly loved him with everything I had. Now it just feels like someone who meant the entire world to me and claimed he felt the same didn't take a second to walk away from it all, instantly. 
And if I'm being fair I did attempt suicide last year in month of June and I think that rattled him. He tried to break up with me the very next night and when I begged him to stay he did. But his actions completly changed towards me. He became cruel and cold. 

Ever since I have been extremely lonely and have been trying to cope with it with some unhealthy mechanisms. With what I am doing right now I can see myself going down the path of alcohol abuse and ending up killing myself in one way or another. With every passing day the thought of dying brings some sort of comfort and a fragile sense of comfort. I figure this is not normal but I'm told everyone has suicidal thoughts and that everyone grows tired of living but push on regardless. Am I thinking too much into it or am I over analysing/ thinking? I would appreciate some advice since I cannot talk about this to anyone.
