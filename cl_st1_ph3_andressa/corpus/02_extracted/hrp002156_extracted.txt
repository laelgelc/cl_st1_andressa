I live enough to survive, but I can't find the energy to do much of anything else it feels like. I work two jobs, come home, no ones there to care about how my day was, no ones there for me to provide for. The only reason I can find the streangth to get out of bed and work is because I want to beileve that someday I won't be so alone anymore. I imagine myself getting a nicer apartment, maybe I'll learn to cook better than I can, I'll have someone over and at that moment in time maybe it'll finally be worth it. The only reason I don't just give up is the idea that someday I won't have to be alone, how pathetic is that?


I can close my eyes and almost make it feel real. I come back home, I walk inside and he's happy to see me. I see that smile on his face and I feel my strength grow, I feel energy given to me that I havnt felt in so long. I can imagine falling asleep knowing that when I wake I won't be alone in the world anymore. In my every action I would confident; knowing that it's for something greater that just myself.


Sometimes it feels like I'd die for people who wouldn't do the bare minimum for me. I just want a special place in someone's life, to look into his eyes and feel like I have a purpose and something to be fighting for. It feels like there's something set wrong in me; I wasn't made right, connection escapes me because people can't connect with someone so incorrectly made. Feels to me like everyone has something I'm missing. People wake up and exist for themselves, I don't understand how they do that. Being alone with myself sober makes me feel like I'm losing my mind.
