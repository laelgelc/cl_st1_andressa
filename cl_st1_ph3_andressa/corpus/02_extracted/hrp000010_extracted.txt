Have you guys ever felt so lonely and pathetic you actually felt a weird sense of pleasure, like a tingle in your body, whenever you talk shit to yourself? I feel really bad about myself, but I still love myself. But I'm so pathetic that whenever I go on these moments of self-depreciation and self-insult, I actually kinda enjoy it cos I know how true it is. I dunno, maybe it's just me.

One example is me fantasizing about my crush, but knowing how out of her league I am and how I'm not likely to ever have a social or love life, I insult myself and I tell myself to dream more realistically and to stop being an idiot. I can't even feel safe or secure in my own mind anymore. I just wanna know if someone else out there feels the same way for some sort of validation.
