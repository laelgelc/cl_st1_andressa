I have a crush on someone at work. I’m 36. Feels too old for a crush. But I get all giddy when I see that this person is working and based on how he reacts towards me, he couldn’t care less if I lived or died. So I am head over heels for yet another person who wants nothing to do with me. 10 years of being single. This is beginning to feel like a curse.
