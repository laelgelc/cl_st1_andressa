This has always been the case for me ever since I was young; I never looked for friends and people to be around. Instead, I made the choice to be by myself. I am currently in college and spend each second of the day by myself. I know that I have some mental health issues such as social anxiety but even if that wasn't the case, I wouldn't want to be around and or close to people. 

I just want to be left alone.
