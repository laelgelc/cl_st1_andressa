Being the new hire is a humiliation ritual every time I swear to God. You’ll enter a new job with enthusiasm just to find out you’ll be getting grilled and watched like a hawk for however long or maybe even indefinitely. It’s aggregating to say the least. 

I don’t consider myself a stupid person. I notice a lot and I have intuition like no other. I sense things and most of the time I know exactly why somebody has something to say. 

Managers will be managers, why some feel the need to psychoanalyze and take things so serious is beyond me. We are all just trying to make money so we can enjoy 48 hours at our house and enjoy our bills being paid. I will never understand the amount of give a fuck some of these managers have. 

I got about 4 hours of sleep last night because I suffer from insomnia and once I am woken up I will not go back to sleep, my brain rambles on and on, I can feel myself blinking even though my eyes are closed. It sucks and it’s due to the shift change. 
Therefore these things I have less tolerance for. 

I don’t latch a gate right, I don’t give every animal I work with 10 minuets of play yard time, I can’t be on my phone even though half of these dogs just want to sniff and enjoy the fresh air, I am too fast and I need to slow down running dogs to playgroup, I don’t wrap the hose right, I close the doors of the kennels after cleaning to get it out of the walk way and some birthing guy that is apparently from France tells me that’s not the right way to do it so I suppose we are supposed to just run into these metal kennels?

When I see a manager I try to escape eyesight just so I don’t have to hear it. Because I swear to God every time I’m in anyone’s line of sight I am subjected to some talking to that I already knew or tell me I’m doing wrong at something.
