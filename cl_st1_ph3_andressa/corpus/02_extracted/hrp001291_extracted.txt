I m an introvert person.. can’t talk to each n every person.. very bad at small talk specifically.. needs to share n understand somethings.. 

I recently shifted to new city new job.. having so many difficulties in talking to people.. making new friends.. sometimes i feel so lonely specially in office & that mood comes to my home also sometimes.. sad boring n what not.. 

I hv friends not so many but i take ridiculously so much time in making so.. just wondering seeing some of the people they can talk to any person on any topic.. 

I was thinking should I develop such qualities in me ?? Is it necessary?? Or compulsory for survival or something else to be developed/changed in my personality.. 

Please give some suggestions.. Thanks in advance..
