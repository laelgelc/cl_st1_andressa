Hey all. Just need to vent. I’m so tired of not being able to rely on anyone but myself and it’s driving me into a worse mental space.

I have a tiny, toxic, very unhealthy family that I don’t speak to much, and no close friends. I’m 27 now and I’ve had two cats since I was a kid that have been my best friends through everything - I got one at 10 and one at 13. The one I got at 13 unfortunately passed 7 months ago, and now my older one’s health is declining too. My own health is declining as well and I can’t afford the necessary diagnostics to help me because I have terrible health insurance through my low-paying job that covers absolutely nothing.

I barely make enough money to get by. I rent with a roommate, which helps a bit, but it’s still wildly expensive to rent where I am. And with rent, car payment, insurance, debt payments, grocery bills (because I make just above the limit as a single childless person to get food stamps fml), and now vet/medicine bills for my cat (I will spend whatever I need to make her comfortable), I’m under a ton of financial stress on top of my already bad mental health from severe OCD, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

I want to get my act together but I literally cannot without spending money. I need medical help, both for my physical and mental health. I need more money to become more financially secure. I have absolutely no support system and no college degree to pursue a better job, and no money or motivation to even think about going back to school. I’d probably just drop out and be in more debt.

I know I’m not alone and there are so many of us struggling right now. This is one aspect of loneliness that I don’t hear too many people talk about. Being born with a support system that can help when you’re strapped financially is SUCH a privilege.
