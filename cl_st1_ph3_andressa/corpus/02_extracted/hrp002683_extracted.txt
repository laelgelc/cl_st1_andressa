Hey I'm new here. It's not that I'm not good at making a conversation, I just don't want to. I have very few friends (online only) and I don't even talk to them daily and they don't know much about me. 

I think I'm more mature than people around me so I don't like to talk to them and when I find such people who are better than me, I hesitate to talk to them bc they'll think I'm dumb and will start ignoring me. So I don't talk to ppl at all, if they try to start a conversation, I can continue but I never start that. Feel me?
