Is it normal to feel that talking to people online only increases feelings of loneliness?
I wanted to make friends I could talk to face-to-face, spend time with, and maybe hug, but that doesn't exist at my age. Only in adolescence. The only way would be to get a boyfriend, but I've never dated before, I don't know what I'll get. But I don't have a choice, do I?

(Although, deep down, I do have an idea. But it's so hopeless to know that I wouldn't be able to ward off loneliness that I need to ignore my own ideas.)
