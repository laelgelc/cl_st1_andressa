I’ve never been one to complain about my alone time, I love my nonverbal me time. But im starting to notice how lonely it’s made it. I have friends, people who care about me, but it’s all so surface level yk? Im so grateful for my husband, the friends, and family I have. Ik I have people, so why do I feel that pit of loneliness in my chest? 

I’ve been coming to the realization that I’m not great at making or even keeping friends. I have friends I’ve had for years and I would do anything for them, but I do realize not many of them consider me their BEST friend. I’m not sure I’ve had the feeling or that relationship of a “typical” best friend as a girl in my 20s either. I have my husband and he definitely is my best friend, but that’s a different kinda of best friend. 

I think these feelings are coming up more now that there are things I don’t want to do alone. I feel envious when I’m at the gym and I see two friends coming in together. It’s the worst after church when everyone’s chatting and socializing and I just awkwardly walkout. I want to talk to them. I want to make friends. I just don’t know how. And I think a little I’m scared. But I don’t want to be stuck in this cycle and I don’t want to feel this way. 

Sorry for the random rambling
