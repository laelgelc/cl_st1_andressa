So I 17 and am really lonely right now. I am quiet and quite frankly boring. I was always alone in my class and only had a distant friend in my school who I sometimes talked to. I felt super lonely but I was too shy to do something about it. This year i tried to change myself and find friends in my new school but the 2 girls i talked to a bit don’t really wanna spend time with me and i feel left out. The distant friend I had is now gone. I have never talked to my mom about these things because we don’t talk much and are not close. My dad is also dead. I have never hugged, kissed or had any sort of romantic thing with someone. I also haven’t been to any parties. One of the two girls in my new school just sent me a snap of her with friends at a party drinking and having fun and it made me think of how pathetic my life is
I feel like the loneliness is killing me and i would rather not exist at all.
If anyone has any solutions please tell me cause i feel horrible rn.
