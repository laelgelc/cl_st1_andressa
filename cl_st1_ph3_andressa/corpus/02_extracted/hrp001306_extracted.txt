I am 18 and i think i am really aware for my age and my generation. When i am in school, i cant wait to get home and just spend time by playing videogames and now i even started or "trying" working out, but when i get home it just hits me that, unlike my friends who are mostly extroverts, i have really nothing going on in my life. They always seem so happy, funny and stuff, and my life seem lonely, because i dont know where or how to naturaly meet people, mostly because of school i am attending which, i found out, makes real relation ships, really hard. I tried dating this one really beautiful girl, which i tought was going really well, but it ended really unexpectedly, and from that moment on i became addicted to nicotine. So now it just clicked in me. What if i am feelin lonely because i am tryin to cope with it with unhealthy habits? I have a few good friends, great family and school i wanted to do, so what if its just those bad habits? The nicotine, g.oning, laziness and drinking?

Sorry for my bad english and if this doesnt make sense, i just need to vent somwhere so sorry if its not the right place to post this. Have a great day
