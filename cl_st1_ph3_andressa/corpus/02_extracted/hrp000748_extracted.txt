So...im just going to jump into it because I need to vent. So I met my ex husband at 21 years old, we got married had a baby, and were married for 6 years. He was a serial cheater and I forgave him over and over again. Right so when he finally got everything he could out of me, he left me and our son. Wants nothing to do with our son even though I begged. Anyway, I waited a year before dating again. I wasn't even trying to find anyone just putting myself out there. Well I did find someone. We were long distance for a year and then I left everything I knew behind to go live with him 2 hours away from family. So we were happy, I dreamt of a future with him. He made all of these promises, hopes, and dreams. We had a real thing, so I thought. I was with him for 3 1/2 years and in that time I supported us and 3 kids (mine and his 2) for the most part. Then he went months and months and months without work. I did not judge him, I supported him and his kids, I loved him so much. Well, he was getting depressed so I suggested finding him work. Hes not very good at paperwork or any of the fancy stuff so I helped. I spent hours and hours applying to jobs for him and we finally found one he really enjoys. So he started working, he was happy again, he even got promoted to manager and got a fancy truck along with the promotion!....then somewhere along all of this happening he ALSO decided he got everything out of me that he could and he dumped me. So, I had a husband who took most of the light in me and then a boyfriend who did the exact same thing who promised he would NEVER do that to me. So now, im stuck, with no more love to give and most of my light gone and no family to run to. Im alone and used.
