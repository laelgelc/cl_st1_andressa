Hi, I'm Kenneth and I'm from Singapore, im 22 years old turning 23 in may. I've been alone for 22 or 23 years. Been bullied at school when i was a kid and as a teenager. Didn't have much friends or never been into a relationship. It's stop when it came to colleage. But loneliness has been there. Followed by lust a small monster now evolve into something big inside of me. a giant monster that i can't seems to fight it on, so i let it consumed me, as well as loneliness.

what's totally been with me is music, Five Nights at Freddy's and myself. I've attempted to end myself back in 2021 and i have been admitted into a psych ward, been into meds and doctors things got stabled.

But it comes back, it always does.

Parents are toxic, not understanding.
