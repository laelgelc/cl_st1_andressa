Everyone around me is superficial. I like my friends. I like playing games with them, and stuff. But something hurts so bad about not having anyone who I can really connect with. Nobody out there is really... a part of my life. I don't have anyone to... talk to, I guess. I want the kind of friend I can just call and talk to about my day, someone who I can spend time with without needing a purpose or a reason. I don't know if I can ever have that. I thought I did, but, I ruined that too. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I wasn't so broken.
