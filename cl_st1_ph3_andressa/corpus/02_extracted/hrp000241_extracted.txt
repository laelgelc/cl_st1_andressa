What your oppinion on this one?

I'm (16m) year something single in depresion, and wihot  any more hope in finding anyone new.

Okay so, I started to smoke flowers recently and i found this, when you are baked you don't really think about bad things in bad mood. And you are dealed with everythink what happend to you. True it is hard to smoke when you don't know anyone who already somokes, but even I was able to find someone so it shoulden't be that hard.

(I'm high rn)
