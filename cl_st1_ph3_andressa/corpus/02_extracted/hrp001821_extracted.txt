Growing up I could really manage being alone, even setting time for myself to be alone. I never understood loneliness because I love my own company and doing what I like. I enjoyed my hobbies or just being in my dream world. 

Now in my 30s, I no longer find satisfaction in my hobbies. I have basically no friends because I rarely find a connection that makes me feel alive. I’d rather be on my own then go out with a friend that talks nonstop and interrupts if I start to say something. Ironically, I feel I waste my time every time I go out on date or with friends. 

I crave a connection where I am seen, understood. I feel very empty inside. I don’t think it is depression but it is definitely making me feel so sad. 

Sometimes, I just go talk like a maniac to several men to get validation and attention, then I get bored quickly, nothing makes me feel good. I end up feeling more frustrated and lonelier than before. 

I don’t even know what I am saying now, I guess it is just desperation.
