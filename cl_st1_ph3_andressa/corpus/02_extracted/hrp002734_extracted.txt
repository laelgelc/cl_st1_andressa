Could you guys check out my page... do you think it’s possible? I want to become an actor in films or tv shows and such but I’m not sure if I have that “it factor”. I’m hard working (I only have like 2 close friends) independent, and diligent. I know because I used to have this job at a bakery. I have a meeting at an acting school in only a few days to see if I can get in this semester and I really hope that I do because honestly this is all I have... I’ve had a rough time and acting or music have always been an escape for me from being different and getting treated like an outcast everyday. I like making people feel things... I don’t like that much being alone so I’ve always used my time to do something creative
