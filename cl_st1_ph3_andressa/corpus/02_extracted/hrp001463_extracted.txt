Hello, my fellow loners! (I don't feel nearly as cheery as this made me sound)

As a person suffering from chronic feelings of loneliness from a young age, I am getting to the point where I have accepted it as a part of my life. Things may change but the feeling won't go. 

What are some of the ways that you have found to cope with this feeling? Especially when you can't do anything externally to change the circumstance.
