All I have is hatred in my heart now, nothing but hate. I fucking hate a lot of people. Don’t try to tell me lightening up and being nicer is the answer because I genuinely tried that for many years and it did nothing except bring more issues. So I defaulted to my regular real self again. I’ve been through so fucking much I don’t even really wanna be around anymore. I’d rather die in my sleep osrs. Fuck god btw and fuck Jesus. Hypocritical pieces of shit. Good for nothing. 
I feel being alone for this long has finally taken its toll, and it feels good to be fucked up to people now. Making them feel small, shitting on everything they care about and love. Beating them on every verbal argument and making them look like the retard that they truly are, in front of everyone for everyone to see in person or on social media. I FUCKING HATE PEOPLE. I genuinely feel good after fucking their days up. The world can deal with this now.
