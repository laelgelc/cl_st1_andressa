I have had no friends since elementary school and i think covid made it worse. in my area their are no people that would want to be friends with. (I'm not being picky or unwelcoming just general lack of common interest) I'm closeted so if tried to flirt with a guy he would either think I'm weird or get offended. I've made two friends but they each moved away out of state and we have grown apart, I feel like the friends I have made, I was just a phase their life
