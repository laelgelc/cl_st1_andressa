I’m sitting here alone listening to gf asmr, completely embarrassed by the fact that I lowkey really love hearing someone act like they care. Why tf am I so alone I’m a decent looking guy I make solid money. Is there something wrong with me why can’t I keep a woman around. Even just a friend I damn near always end up getting fucked over. Why is this?
