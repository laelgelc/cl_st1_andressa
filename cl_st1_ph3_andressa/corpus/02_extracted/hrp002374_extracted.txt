  
After spending a lot of time on social media, i often feel kinda empty or sad.  
Nothing specific happened, it’s just a weird feeling.

I’m connected to so many ppl online, but i still feel alone sometimes.  
Like my energy is drained but i didnt actually do anything meaningful.

Is this just me or does scrolling do this to others too?
