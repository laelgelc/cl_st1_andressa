Is it fair or validated when your friend starts hanging out with your ex when she knows what your ex did to you as well as claiming the are now dating supposedly or at least is hoping about being girlfriend and girlfriend like friend and I lost a mistake friend to suicide and we shared a common trauma but also is not great about communicating with you and makes stuff up about what your ex is thinking or something I want to handle this delicately but also let your friend know you know longer what to be friends etc
