I am 32 years old, have been practicaly alone (beside my family and friends) my whole life(at least that's what i am considering alone)i do think i know what it does mean to be alone, i just wanna tell all the people here i love you! Never give up! Never loose fun of your life! You only have one , keep on going, it's the small things in life we need to enjoy and rememeber! 

I don't know if it's fits the rule of this sub, if not i am sorry, but i do feel some people need positiv message from strangers.

You are all awesome guys!!!!!!
