Honestly I just always have disliked the holidays.. legit was the cook and waiter for family events always dishing and serving then expected to sit alone in the kitchen unless I was called to fix people’s plates or for clean up… over 16 years of that… and now that I moved away from the toxicity of my family is it wrong to almost feel like I miss it?… I won’t miss being taken for granted like that I won’t miss buying big ticket items last minute ( because that’s what they just needed to have 3 days before Christmas! ) just to be told they wanted something different now. While I would be lucky to get a card from the friend of the family that came for dinner.  ( I understand it’s not about what you get I do but maybe just alittle thought would be nice ) between that and a ex that would throw a tantrum because he didn’t want to be there  while keeping the family calm.

I didn’t even bother setting up a tree in my apartment. I’m not celebrating I see no point.

But at the same time I will say I guess I am going to miss the craziness? I’m alone in a different state far away.. I just can’t seem to find my calm yet..
