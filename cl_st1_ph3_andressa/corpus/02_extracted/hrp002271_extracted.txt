Just wanted to say that everyone here is so brave for sharing their problems. For someone who has been alone since COVID, and never recovered from chronic loneliness, I can't help but admit I am brought to tears by each post.

So many people are lonely, no one deserves to feel lonely, please know if you ever post here, there are people like me reading your thoughts in hopes things get better.
