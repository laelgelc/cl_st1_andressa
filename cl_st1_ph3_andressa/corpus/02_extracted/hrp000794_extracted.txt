Kia ora (hello) from New Zealand,

I went into hospital a few days ago with a large blood clot in my lung. Apparently I am lucky to be alive. Which, honestly, I'm dissapointed it didn't get me. 

I have no friends and just my brother and my dad in my life. My brother visited for a little on the first day but he has a bisy life. So now I'm just laying here wishing I wasnt here at all, ya know...

I'm just so lonely in life.
