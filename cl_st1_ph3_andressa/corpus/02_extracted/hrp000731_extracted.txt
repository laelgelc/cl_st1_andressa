It’s been creeping in heavy lately but it’s rough tonight. I’ve been working out and trying to distract myself with work and “friends” going on terrible dates lol…But everything is starting to feel so pointless. I feel like I’m just existing. I don’t have a real family that cares about me or loves me. Just my brother and I hate feeling like I’m imposing upon him and his young child and pregnant wife. I live away from them all across the country. I lost my Mom in 2022 she was my best friend and I’ve never been the same since. My father is a narcissistic bully and I’ve gone no contact with him to protect myself. I’m still trying to heal from a broken engagement and betrayal that shattered my heart. I think that’s another thing that makes it so difficult to date. I’ve tried therapy and fitness and hobbies nothing works…It just feels like I’m going through the motions to prolong pain…Idk I just struggle to find real reasons to be here anymore more. I’m not even having mental and emotional breakdowns anymore. I just feel numb and empty. Like a void.  I’ve been thinking about not being here lately more often than I’m beginning to be comfortable with. I’ve realized everyone I know would get over it pretty quickly….I’m just really sick and tired of feeling this constant pain and loneliness. This empty pointless seeming void in my chest and head….Ive tried praying…Idk what to do.
