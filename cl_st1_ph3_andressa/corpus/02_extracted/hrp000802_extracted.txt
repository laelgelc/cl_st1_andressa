Hello everyone my name is Nicolas I am 22 years old I have never done anything with a woman never had a date anything the only thing I went further was yesterday the hand of a girl but for more than 4 years I will say now I have never had any real contact that means no attraction no flirting nothing. And yet I go out, I'm a sociable person, I have friends, I'm not particularly ugly, but no matter what I do, I always come across as the gentleman, and yet I've tried to change but to stay myself depending on the feeling I have with the girl, but nothing can be done. I have a lot of problems in my life but I would like at least to have a girlfriend maybe she would come along and at least relieve my heart a little from everything I'm going through on the side and we say obviously but we'll solve the problem we'll see an escort but that's not how I want to do it I want to have a person who loves me for me for what I am and I want to give all the love I have to give but I think I'm in a society where unfortunately I will never be accepted for what I am and I will never find anyone.
