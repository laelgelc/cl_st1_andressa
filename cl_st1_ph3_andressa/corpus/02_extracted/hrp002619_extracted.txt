I've always had this problem and this is mostly the reason why I became a loner in the first place. 

I have ppl in my life, sure.. like family and a partner.. but I never feel like I emotionally connected with anyone... even the closest ppl to me can't connect to me. I've eventually accepted this fact about myself and I just pretend they understand me and just drop it. 

My emotions run deep... like very deep. Deep enough that I crave to have someone on that level with me wether it be a friend, family member, lover, whichever. Unfortunately I have been unsuccessful.

Does anyone else feel this way? Did you close your walls down for this reason too?
