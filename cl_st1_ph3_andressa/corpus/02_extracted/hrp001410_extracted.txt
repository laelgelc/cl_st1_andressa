(30 M) I’ve been a single dad for years and am realizing more and more how much I am never going to meet “the one”. I see so many people in relationships, even at my churches, and yet I’m alone. All of my siblings have someone, yet I’m alone. I have no real friends, even my family doesn’t visit - I have to be the one to visit. I don’t have a good job, or prospect, and never went to school because I was suicidal and never thought I’d make it through my twenties. 
I don’t want to make this a long rant so I won’t. I’m miserable yet have guys and old ladies tell me I’m attractive. I refuse to sleep around and just want a good laugh, hug and nights rest.
