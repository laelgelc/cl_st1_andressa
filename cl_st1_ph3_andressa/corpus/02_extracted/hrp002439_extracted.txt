Its been a while since I felt this alone. I do the most important things like work in a job that I do love a lot, pay the bills properly, keep my home in good shape, do sports that I like and am good at, play some online games that I am too good at, started therapy recently, take care of my dogs like if they were my children, among other good things. On the other hand, I also have a vape addiction, can´t stop smoking all the time, also a gamble addiction that has me on debt, but because of my job, I can rescue it if I set my goal to it. Anyway, I feel alone. I feel like nobody reaches me out, even if they actually do and I do go out. I think that being without a girlfriend makes me feel this way. I feel that my loses and successes are being left out, I am growing in some ways by myself and I can't share that with no one. I do share some things, but it is not the same. Don't get me wrong, I feel grateful for the life I have, but I feel that its not worth living it by myself. I have so much love to give, but being a man has its consequences nowadays. You don't matter that much. The sad part is that I am handsome, have a normal body, am smart. I am not saying I need a girlfriend. I have been in long relationships and this feeling of loneliness just dims a bit, but it has always been within me.

I have tried praying to God too, but he doesn't help me with this specific thing. I know he has my back in the other good things.

  
Does anybody has felt something like this?
