At the end of this summer basically all of my friendships blew up one by one, and my friend group totally annexed me. I had no idea why for a long time but I now know that one of my former friends spread a vile and very sexual rumor about me, I suspect to drive me away that way he could start dating a girl we were mutual friends with. 

Out of a group of like 18 people, two have stuck around and I've had two close friends who I see and talk to pretty consistently.

Until now that is!

One of my friends was very close to me and she stuck around through everything that happened, but like a month ago she just stopped ever texting me first, barely responded when I did, and was overall noticeably more distant. 

I finally dug up the courage to text her and confront her about this today, and as I had kinda suspected, the rumor got into her too and she'd been distancing herself from me silently because she no longer felt comfortable being my friend. 

I've lost count now, how many times one of my friends has just said goodbye and made up their mind that our friendship is over without even talking to me. 

I honestly don't know how I can ever trust again. At this point every time I get anxious that someone is going to abandon me over something small like them being a little distant, every time I convince myself it's not about me, that little anxiety delusion turns out not to be a delusion at all. Just about every person I've let myself trust has subverted that trust. 

  
I know it's not really true but it's hard not to let this feed into the whole "everyone will always leave me" internal narrative and I don't really know how I'll ever be able to be secure and feel safe that someone actually has my best interest in heart anymore.
