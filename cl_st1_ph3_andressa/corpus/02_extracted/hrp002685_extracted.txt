Made a post a few months back on becoming a new loner in my school.

Well, due to reasons I don't quite know I set back out to find some new friends. Around three weeks ago I found a group; I hung with them but I guess they weren't what I expected. They were very tight-knit so a new person hanging out with them probably made them feel weird. They'd only say inside jokes and if you weren't a part of their inner-circle they wouldn't talk to you much.  


Thus, ladies and gentlemen, I'm retiring to my normal corner of the school alone. I don't feel shame for this; I know tomorrow I won't be mentioned when I'm absent and I don't really mind. I think being alone is just how I'm supposed to be - I can try to be extroverted all I want but at the end of the day, I'm introverted at heart.
