Hi I'm 20 years old and a junior in college. I have no friends despite studying abroad last semester and joining clubs and activities throughout university to the point I was on the executive board for many of them. I pretty much go to many social events to try to talk to people but nobody does other than guys trying to hook up with me which I don't want. I try to talk to people in my classes but I often get ignored and I truly don't know what's wrong with me. I have very good social skills and extremely extroverted but I still really struggle. Does anyone has any advice that may help or should I just give up and try to cope?
