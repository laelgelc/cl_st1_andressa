Im dreaming about a woman in my life. A woman who brings calm to my mind, softness to my body and makes room for my real self to be. No masks, no lies, just pure self. Love, closeness, i dream of her soft skin stroking my hair or her arms wrap around me and i can finally let my guard down. I feel like women add so much value to a mans life, value no one else can give. I feel like its missing in my life and i can be around people and friends as much as i want, i will go home alone and that stings deep inside my open, loving and caring heart. Yes i care, i care to much. And i would want someone who cares about me, just a tiny little bit. 

I held myself with the word "sometimes".
But in a song i recently discovered there is a line that says: "sometimes is just kinda a word for never". And i hope that this is not true. I have a little hope left. I wanna live, i wanna love, i wanna share my whole world. Not to anyone, to someone who stays long enough to listen and not to judge, someone who takes things slowly and does this with me, not for me or against me. With me. Im still hoping, im still hurting, and i still care
