I've(M-26) been single for 3 years. After I moved to another country permanently, the loneliness I had, got worse and it depresses me seriously. Even though I am not that attractive, my friends say the opposite( I might have lack of confidence).

I am not one of those guys who can do anyything to sleep with women. I don't wanna seem like/become like f*ckboy. Since I've been single, I don't have sex life for a long time. I could have sex but I don't want to do it with someone who is lower my league.

I don't like going out by myself. I guess I am not good at socializing.
I really don't know what to do.
