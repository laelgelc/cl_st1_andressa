Hey everyone,

Four years. That’s how long clinical depression had me in a chokehold. Most days I barely left my room, I pushed away or straight-up ghosted every single friend I had, and eventually nobody was left. I’m not proud of it, but that’s what happened when you’re drowning and can’t even explain why.

A couple of months ago something finally clicked — therapy, meds, lifestyle changes, sheer stubbornness — whatever it was, it worked. For the first time in years I wake up and actually want to be here. I’ve got energy again, ideas again, hope again.

So I poured everything into a new startup I’ve been quietly building. It’s the first thing that’s felt truly meaningful in forever. Beta is launching in the next 2–3 months and I’m stupidly excited about it… but also kind of isolated. I don’t have that circle anymore to bounce ideas off, celebrate tiny wins with, or just vent when things get hard.

I miss having people to talk to about this stuff — the real startup rollercoaster. The 3 a.m. panic about whether anyone will care, the random feature ideas, pricing stress, imposter syndrome, all of it.

If you’re also building something, love startups, or just want to chat about random founder things (or literally anything else), please DM me or drop a comment. I’d genuinely be so grateful to connect with even one or two people again. I respond to everyone.

Thanks for reading this far. Means a lot.

(And yes, once the beta drops I’ll probably share what it is — it’s deeply tied to what pulled me out of the darkness — but for now I just want some humans to talk to 😂)

Take care ❤️
