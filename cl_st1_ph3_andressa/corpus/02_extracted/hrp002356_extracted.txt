“How did it start? Your parents thought you was so smart

You’ve done your best, trying in jest

Hands in your face, trying to not lose your place 

People are strange, when your a stranger

Women are cruel, and they make you out to be the fool

Streets are uneven, when you’ve fallen and bleeding

Faces seem angry when your just trying to be happy 

No one cares, even when you disappear

So you live your life, hoping to reappear”
