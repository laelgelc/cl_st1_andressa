Sorry i am venting out a little bit,so as a girl in india living with anxiety disorder it’s really difficult and hard to socialise and make friends easily so whenever i make any friends i try to keep them and kinda seem desperate . I feel empty and lonely all the time mostly however in college i try to be happy and hide my awkwardness that everyone is having friend groups and going out but i silently have to come alone honestly without any actual interaction. i am trying to find online friends but never works out. I always try to pretend that i am happy but when i am alone i cry !!
