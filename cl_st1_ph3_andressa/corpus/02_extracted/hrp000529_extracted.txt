I almost didn't write this because i didn't want it on my post history but i thought why not. Everything has been shit for me for a while now. On the 20th of December a year ago my bf at the time shot himself infront of me online so this time is especially tough. Im still in school even though im almost to graduate and i have no idea what to do with my life i have no plans no hobbys no nothing. Nothing anymore really makes me happy when i get home and im not working I just lay in bed by myself i cant do anything of value. I feel like i dont really have a family because the all feel so separate from me im trans and bi and im only out to my family on the bi part and they hate and shame me for that and pretty much everything else i do. I had a girl i was interested in and was talking to but she ghosted me after we hung out once. Im very ugly and women and men dont like me. I have no friends outside school and few there. I had a girl i was talking too who was rlly rlly close to me and she was like the closest thing ive ever had to a mother and was the best person in my life but she ended up stealing from me and now i dont talk to her anymore and it rlly upsets me i have to see her everyday and remember how it all might have been fake and she never really loved or cared abt me no one has. Ive tried to kms more times then i can count and i see that as the only way out. I have no idea what else i could do in life so i just wish i was dead. Idk why i made this again i know no one gives a shit but maybe i just wanted to yell into the void and leave something here incase i successfully kms just to leave smth behind.
