I’m writing this because I’m honestly feeling scared and overwhelmed right now. For the past few months, I’ve been having intense physical symptoms, chest pain around my heart, shivering hands, and this really strong internal vibration throughout my body. It feels extremely real and physical, like something is seriously wrong.
Only recently did it click that these might actually be panic attacks. Realizing that helped a bit, but at the same time it’s still really frightening when it happens. In the moment, my body feels completely out of control, and my mind goes straight to worst-case scenarios.
Right now I’m just looking for some human connection. If anyone is around and willing to chat for a bit, I’d really appreciate it. I don’t need fixing. just someone to talk to so I don’t feel so alone and can calm down.
