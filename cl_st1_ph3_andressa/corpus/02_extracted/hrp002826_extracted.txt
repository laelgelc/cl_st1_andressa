We just had another hangout today where we exchanged about what we can best to. We talked about whether this subreddit (and our whole efforts) should be about people feeling lonely or whether it's rather about people who want to do something about it. 

We decided to go for the latter. We thus also change the description of this subreddit to "This Subreddit is to discuss and share ideas, leads, and research for founding an international movement to address loneliness.  Please join us on this mission!"

Any thoughts on this?
