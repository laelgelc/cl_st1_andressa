I woke up this morning and I was already feeling off. I am such an eccentric individual. I don't get along easily. I feel like I am autistic sometimes because my social problems in the end are all about noise and not being able to ear my voice clearly unless I scream... i like silence I guess... i don't like being seen because I don't trust people. My favourite thing to do in a social setting is go away with minimal explanation, with a big bye and a big smile, almost running away, in the open air.
