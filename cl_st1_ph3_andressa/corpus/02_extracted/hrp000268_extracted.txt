So anyone else at home with no plans on New Years Eve for 2018? LOOOOOL.....bc  I am. Watching Game Of Thrones and finally took a break from it only to realize this is the second year I haven't done anything for countdown.. so if you're like me and use tinder often, watch game of thrones, lonely as fuck or just having a shitty time..feel free to strike a convo xD
