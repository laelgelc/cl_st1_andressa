I have a family, a group of friends, and many aquaintances, but I still feel alone. I feel like nobody in this world truly understand me. Well, I can't blame anyone since it's me who couldn't bear to be vulnerable to someone in the first place.

I have this irrational fear of others seeing me struggle, depressed, afraid, and ashamed. Maybe it's because I fear the feeling of "embarrassment" or I fear that people might judge me, reject me, and abandon me. Maybe it's everything all at once.

It's just that I couldn't bring myself to be real to people. I have to change a certain part of my personality to be "included", but no matter how hard I try, I NEVER feel included anywhere. 

It hurts when my family gets along so well, and them talking to me feels forced because I'm always quiet. It hurts when I try to be nice to my friends all the time but could never really feel a connection. It hurts to pretend that life is no big deal, that I can also handle things many people consider easy. It hurts to deal with my pessimistic and self-deprecating thought patterns. It just hurts soo much when I'm suffering, but everyone thinks I'm fine. 

I wish I'm not afraid of saying that I'm not okay, that I'm suffering and I need help. Opening up is easy for others, but not for people like me who was criticized for my incompetence and mocked for my tears. This is why I feel lonely even if I'm surrounded by people.

Is there anyone here in a simular situation? Does anyone know how to be less afraid of being vulnerable to others?

Thanks for hearing me out. I appeciate it. Have a lovely day.
