Hi everyone,  
I'm back at hosting another Circle - this time the theme is Grief. We're planning this for 12th Dec, Thursday 7:30 pm so that more folks can join in post work and it does not collide with weekend plans or work.

How it works:

* We typically start out with some basic group guidelines laying down confidentiality and rules that help us maintain a safe space (no interruptions)
* We go around the group where everyone gets a chance to share their struggles, thoughts, experience on grief.

How this helps:

* It gives you a group of strangers to connect to who might have experienced similar situations - making it easier to talk
* It opens you up and enables you to talk about your struggles - breaking mental health taboo
