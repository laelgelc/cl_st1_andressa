Being alone in your 40s can feel strangely invisible. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a partner, close family, or a solid group of friends  and that’s something people don’t talk about much. Days are filled with work, routines, distractions… but when everything stops, there’s no one to text, no one really waiting on the other side.Sometimes it feels like everyone else has their place, their circle, their “people,” and you’re standing just outside of that. I don’t think this makes us broken just human.For context, I’m a woman in my mid-40s. I get the sense this kind of loneliness doesn’t really care about gender. I’m curious how others experience this stage of life.
