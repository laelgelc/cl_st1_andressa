Like an intense anger when somebody's family comes in visits. I'm at the workplace thinking. I have no family myself. But how can they have something that? I've longed for years given to them so easily and here I am with nothing emptiness. Anybody else feel that way like kind of a sickness when you see those other people's families makes you sick your stomach intense anger.
