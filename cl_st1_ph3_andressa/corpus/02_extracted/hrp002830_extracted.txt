All,

okko7, our fearless leader, won't be able to join us this week for our weekly video chat.  I've thus stuck my neck out to host a video chat in his place this Saturday.  Would anyone be interested?  I'd host it at the usual time \(12 PM EST, 5PM UK Time, 6PM GMT\+2\).  It will be on discord again.

Thanks!
