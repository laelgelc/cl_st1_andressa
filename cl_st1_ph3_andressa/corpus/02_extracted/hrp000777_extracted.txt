This is an update of the ' lost all my friends ' post from my previous account (lowlong) .

So yes , now I have decided to finally let go of my so called 'friends' and start a new life in uni from today .

Yes , the same ' friends' who ignored me for weeks , and finally told me to just fuck off yesterday , and that too seriously .

 i guess life will be the same  , without any friends . Maybe I'm gonna spend more time in the library or something.....

But hey , aside from the negative things - I do kinda like the silence now - like , it isn't scary - it was meant to be.
