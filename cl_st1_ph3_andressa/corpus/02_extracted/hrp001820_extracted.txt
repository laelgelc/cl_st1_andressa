I live in a small town on the periphery of Greater London, and there’s nobody nearby me I can hang out with on a regular basis. Everyone I was friends at school with have either moved away (one lives in Wales) or have simply drifted away, and I don’t have the energy to rekindle a friendship because I’ll get no effort back.

There’s loads of hobby and interest groups I’ve joined, but they’re all in the centre of London so a lot of the time I’m having to travel back and forth which doesn’t do me well financially, but the people I meet are amazing and we share a lot in common.

However, it’s sometimes hard to build a proper rapport and closeness due to the fact I live about an hours worth travel away. We see each other at social meet ups and on the odd occasion outside of that to do our own thing, but I feel like it’s hard to maintain consistency because sometimes I just can’t afford train travel + expensive London prices.

I’ve scoured the entire internet and every app to find groups nearby me, but there’s just nothing. Half of me  just feels lonely when I’m in my home area.

EDIT: I also don’t have the money to get my own place  in London because prices are ridiculous
