31M here. I am romantically lonely my whole life. Last year i really tried to change that and i am still trying. Last summer i didn't want to be left romantically alone, i really tried but i failed. Now, that Christmas holidays are coming up soon, i don't want to be left alone. 

Christmas is a romantic holiday. Everything is decorated, snowy nights, cuddles in front of fire place and many other lovely things. I just want a hug with a girl under a decorated Christmas tree. Am i asking too much? I just want to experience this at least once in my life time.

Where is Santa Claus when you most need him...?
