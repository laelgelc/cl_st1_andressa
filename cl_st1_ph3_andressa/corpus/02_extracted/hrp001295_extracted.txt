This year I turn 20 and ever since 2023 I’ve tried telling myself that every new year will be my year but every year I feel cursed. Ik people say happiness comes from within but I’ve tried that and it’s done nothing but make me feel more and more miserable and unhappy. For example on this app people come and go and it’s hard for me to make long term friend’s on here, so it’s left me feeling very hopeless. I can’t even remember the last time I felt happy and sometimes I feel like just taking my own life cause I can’t bear having to deal with the pain of misery and unhappiness.
