I’ve been sitting with this feeling for a while, so I figured I’d put it somewhere people might understand. Especially because I feel like this feeling is only getting worse.

I often feel much older in my soul than I actually am, and it makes it hard to connect with people my age. My passions lean toward things like aviation, history, and maritime topics, every couple weeks or so, there's something specific I hyperfixate on when it comes to learning about it and it's all I focus on. my current hyperfixation is Sutra Baths. Very niche, I understand.

These are very specific worlds that most of my peers just aren’t into. I get that these interests aren’t exactly mainstream, and I don’t expect everyone around me to share them. But sometimes that disconnect spills into simpler things too. I’ll want to spend an entire day just walking along the ocean, listening to the waves, watching the horizon, thinking about ships, time, and everything in between. I crave slow, reflective moments like that, and it often feels like I’m the only one in my circle who does.

I’ve tried to build connections online with people who share these interests, but those relationships rarely feel mutual. I’m usually the one reaching out, initiating, and keeping things going, and eventually I just end up feeling more alone than before. I always tell people I do much better in person. I hate falling into the pattern of connecting briefly, talking for a few weeks and then the falling out.  I just want to feel understood, or at least less out of place in my own age group. I’m trying to accept that I’m wired differently, but some days the loneliness still hits hard.
