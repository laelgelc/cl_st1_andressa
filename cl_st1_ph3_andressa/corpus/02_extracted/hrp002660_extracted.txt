It's been over a year since COVID-19 shook the world, and everyone has to stay in their homes and practice social distancing, meaning they can't see their friends and family at the moment and they would feel lonely because of the pandemic. So I'm curious to know if any of you don't feel the same way they do and actually feel comfortable in your solitude during the pandemic. I know I'd be lying if I said I don't enjoy being alone since I became so used to it for years.
