My best friend of two years has stopped talking to me completely. I don’t know what to do, ever since she broke up with her boyfriend she hasn’t spoken to me consistently. I knew eventually she would stop texting me but it feels way worse than I imagined. Although we attend the same college she has stopped coming to the class we shared. Since before she broke up with him she’s always bragged about how awesome her online friends were. I wasn’t jealous until she wrote a whole essay on English on her best friend, which wasn’t me, it was an online friend. I understand that she probably just saw me as a filler friend but senior year of high school we were inseparable. Also I find it’s way harder to make friends in college because everyone (is what it feels like) already has a friend group set in stone you know? On top of that my boyfriend broke up with me recently too. It’s just been really hard to keep moving through you know? Anyway just wanted to tell someone.
