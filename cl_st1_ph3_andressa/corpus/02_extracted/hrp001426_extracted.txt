Hey,

I'm a 33yo male, no partner and I lost my job. I haven't found a job in half a year.

I have been feeling lonely ever since my traumatic mobbing experience in elementary school.
I am in therapy, but every time I remember the verbal and physical violence I almost throw up.

I am in a sports club, but everytime I ask to go for coffee, everyone declines.
I have 2 friends which I see every 2 weeks.

But most days I sit in my apartment, incredibly depressed, because I cannot self motivate to do anything and there is nobody around to interact with.

I wish I had the motivation to do things that would help, like going out and looking for a job, but I often don't.

I'm really mad with my brain for sabotaging me like this, because I have all it takes to be a happy man with a job and a partner.

It has become harder and harder to write job applications and to ask out women, because I have lost faith in succeeding.

Is there anything I can do?

Whatever it is, it has to be something small I can do and it must give me swift positive feedback. Otherwise I will simply loose heart and stop.

Going to the gym works sometimes, because I believe that it makes me stronger and being able to increase the weight gives me a dopamine high. But some days that doesn't work either.

I am grateful for any support.

If you have advice, remember it needs to be actionable and have a short feedback loop to work for me.

I am also grateful for just messages of sympathy, because they make me feel like I'm not alone in this world.

I wish all of you out there nothing but the best!
