Hello. I (25F) have always got dismissed when i try to make connections. Even with family. I never once got invited to parties, weddings, big events etc. No one talks to me 😔. I tried and tried to tell everyone ( friends and family) about how i felt and its always " well i was busy" or " well you dont talk to me either" which is not true. They talk and invite everyone else but when it comes to me its a issue? Why? Its always been like this when growing up and i dont know what to do. I tried making friends over the years but it fell through tbh. I do have a family (fiance and child) but i feel like my fiance doesn't understand how lonely it is. Besides him and our child i have no one 😔.
