So far this year I’ve lost 4 close friends of mines, but for different reasons. I don’t really have much friends outside of my 4 year relationship, and find it difficult to find people. The issue is that I’m an introvert and I prefer not talking all the time to people but still having some sort of closeness. I also think that I’ve isolated myself from people because I have low self esteem and don’t want to be asked about my life, or giving updates about my life 24/7, I am 21 years old and haven’t really accomplished anything, it’s embarrassing and makes me feel like a failure. I can’t relate to where a lot of my peers are in life and it makes me feel inadequate. Starting off with financial issues, most Gen Z are struggling to find a job, however I get lucky enough to get hired as a server and my first day is this upcoming Tuesday, but for some reason even though most people I know don’t have jobs it’s either there parents send them money or they end up using credit cards. My credit card limit is $200 so and I’ve already maxed it out so I have to pay it off soon. But I just feel that because I don’t look or talk like people my age it’s hard connecting. I have social anxiety but I wouldn’t say it’s severe because I still try and put myself out there but I’m just so awkward. However whenever I talk to one of my friends or my boyfriend conversations flow freely idk what’s wrong with me.
