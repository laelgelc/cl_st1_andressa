I feel like there's nowhere I can go, no one I can trust, not even myself some days

Tried opening up to a friend I've known for years yesterday and she... well you can gather it didn't end well

Most of my old friends moved on and I'm left alone at a crossroads with no one to consult, to run to, to cling onto

Then again the more I look back, maybe I never did and just survived on the though I had someone in my corner

Frankly I'm tired, cold, and deprived of some of the things I needed most. Comments are open I guess...
