When I was around 9–10 years old, I moved to a new place, and from the very first day I was bullied because of my dark skin color and ugly  From Class 4 to Class 12, I faced a lot of racism. Most people called me "african" , black potato and other racist words.

I didn’t like going to school and tried to avoid it as much as I could. Sometimes I thought about fighting back, but I always tried to be a good person. When I reached Class 9, the racism became much worse. My classmates — and even a few people I thought were my friends — started mocking me by calling my father’s name in a wrong and insulting way. This continued until Class 10. Somehow, I survived that too.

In Class 11, I changed my school and location again. On the very first day i don't know why i were the only one got slapped from from english teacher , and my physics teacher doubted me like saying "did you really got good marks in high school ". It took me about a month to make friends, but throughout that year I never truly felt connected to any group. I always felt like an outsider, even though I tried to fit in.

From Class 12 — around 2020 — until now in 2026, I haven’t been able to make any friends. I’ve had no one to talk to. Even though I live with my family, I still feel completely alone.

In 2022, I went to Kota for NEET(competitive exam like SAT)preparation. I lived in a hostel with 6–7 other boys on the same floor, but even there I couldn’t make friends — neither in the hostel nor at the coaching institute.I always tried to avoid even if one tried to approach

This has been my life
