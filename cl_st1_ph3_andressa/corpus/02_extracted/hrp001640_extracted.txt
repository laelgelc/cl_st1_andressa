Hi there! My name is Mary and I am a journalist based in NY. I am working on a story about reconnecting with old friends based off a [Scientific American study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-reconnect-with-old-friends-who-have-become-strangers/?utm_source=Live+Audience&utm_campaign=f8586bf0ce-nature-briefing-daily-20240715&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b27a691814-f8586bf0ce-498684457) that came out this month and looking to speak to people who have either recently heard from an old friend they lost touch with, or reached to an old friend to reconnect. If either applies to you, I'd love to chat! Feel free to DM me.
