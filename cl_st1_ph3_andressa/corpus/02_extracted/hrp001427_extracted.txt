Hello, first of all, if you are reading this, I can say that I have really hit the bottom. No matter how hard I tried to fix my psychology, I always fell weak. My mother and father separated and broke up very badly 2 years ago and I am still facing my traumas. I live with my father and there is no one around me. Unfortunately, I graduated from high school and now I am preparing for university. There is something, what should I do?
