Hello, I'm 23m from Spain. I am very socially awkard and I've never had a girlfriend. I understand that the best way to meet people is in real life, but I would like to have someone to talk to for now and maybe we can even meet in person. I don't mind if you are not close to Spain, I would love to just talk over text. I'm studying history in university, I play rugby, I like to watch MMA and I started going to the gym this summer. I'm a bit of an npc when it comes to movies, shows or music, but I'm down to try whatever you like. My discord is jlkjnljl\_48403. Thanks in advance!
