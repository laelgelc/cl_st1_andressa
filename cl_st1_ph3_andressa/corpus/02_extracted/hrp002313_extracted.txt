Trigger warning: talking about suicide.     

I wrote something while in a depressive episode where I almost committed suicide. Didn’t fit with any other subreddit, so I thought I’d share it here. I’m so close to breaking.      



“When I finally break down, I want my screams of pain to shatter glass, level mountains, crumble buildings, and break skies. When I finally give up and throw everything away, I want people around me to hurt. Maybe then people will finally notice the invisible man who has been here the whole time. The invisible man that tries so desperately to be noticed, much less loved. Maybe the only way for people to notice me, is to get them to see the results of my suffering.”
