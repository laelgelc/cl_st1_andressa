31M I've come to terms with being alone forever. I've had women proposition me for sex, but I wanted more so I turned them down. I got diagnosed BPD 3 years ago, and now I know I never can have a relationship. I love too deeply and feel too strongly to ever give someone that kind of power over me. They could destroy me completely. I was always the hopeless romantic growing up. I liked all that mushy shit like romcoms and twilight. It took a couple years to make peace with my fate, but every week or two, I get hit with a heartbreak so strong it hurts to breath. I just lay on my back looking at the ceiling with tears silently running down the side of my face. I feel a true and all encompassing grief that tears at the fabric of my soul. Then, after anywhere from 30 mins to 3 hours, it goes away. Im tired of it.
