I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people but its hard. People my age (F26) have bfs/gfs, friends, families, a great job, etc. I try to get out and make new friends but its hard. I can be awkward and maybe too much sometimes and people are put off by that. I used to have a best friend and we did everything together. And now she doesn't talk to me anymore. She threw 10 years down the drain for nothing. I feel very lonely now. I also failed my driving test AGAIN.... so I just want to know can anyone else relate.
