Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice and opinions.

A relative of mine has been thinking about starting a small chat/voice channel where they talk with people who feel lonely, want someone to chat with, or just need a space to share thoughts. They currently have a lot of free time and were considering this as a way to keep people company while also making a bit of pocket money.

The idea would be casual, one-on-one conversations (text or voice), not therapy — just friendly social interaction.

They asked for my opinion and also for help figuring out whether this is a good idea and, if so, where something like this could even be shared without being spammy or inappropriate.

So I wanted to ask:

* What’s your opinion on this kind of service?  
* Do you think there’s a real need for it?  
* Are there specific communities or platforms where this could be discussed or posted appropriately?  

I’m genuinely curious to hear different perspectives — both positive and critical. Thanks!
