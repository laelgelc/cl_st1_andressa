ive always had a stable social group but. well, not anymore! feeling left out as they all slowly push me aside, forming their on gc and only talking amongst eachother. im only ever included if i remind them hey! im here guys! whats going on? to which im welcomed with the most surface level conversations and humour which just has the baseline of ’oh im gonna touch you!’ ‘you look so touchable!’…i dont remember the last time i had a good laugh.

ive made new friends but its still pretty surface level. almost coworker-like friendships with my classmates. but its the second last year of highschool and im now finding myself a floater. 

if i dont find any long term friends here, will i find any outside? will i just be an adult who has no friends and just a job? im so scared. why am i never the first choice, or choice at all? am i going crazy? im so scared of even being perceived as alone. everyone here is so mean and i am totally spiralling. i dont want to be alone.
