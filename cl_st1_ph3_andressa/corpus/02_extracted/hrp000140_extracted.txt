Posting into the void again.  As much as I don't want to give up completely on making friends, I'm so tired of trying and always failing to make them.  Clearly I'm the problem but I never get any feedback so I really don't know what exactly I'm doing that's so wrong, and that devastates me and makes me feel so alienated and ostracized.  I want to connect with people more than anything, and I'm not sure what to do now.  The loneliness and isolation are killing me, eating me from the inside out.

Other people in their 30s make the whole friend-making dealeo seem so damn easy and I wish it could be easier for me too, but it never has because social anxiety is a bitch and a half.  Wish my life meant something to someone, even to myself.  I feel worthless and useless, wish my parents never had me.  On top of it all, I feel like my personality got ravaged and taken from me cause of depression and cycling through anti-depressants.  And I'm into really spooky, bizarre interests that further keep me on the outside looking in.  Things seem so hopeless, I should just completely give up.  </3
