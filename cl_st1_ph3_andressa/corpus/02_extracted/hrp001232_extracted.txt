I've always lived with loneliness. It's the only thing that has never abandoned me. I don't understand why no one ever chooses me. As a child, I didn't socialize; I was intimidated by my own strangeness and could never join in conversations. Naturally, I spent all my childhood and teenage years without talking to anyone. Even in high school, during physical education class, no one bothered to choose me. I train, I'm willing to participate, but no one seems interested in having me on their team. I'm always the last one, and to be objective, I'm not chosen because I'm the last available guy. Consequently, I'm not even chosen as the last man standing. This illness manifests itself in every aspect of my life. Not even a cat has ever chosen me.  Therefore, I've tried to improve myself, but nothing works; deep down, I'm always the same useless, rejected person I've always been. I have little success with girls too. I don't understand it; people see something in me that makes them despise me. I'm sure that when I die, no one will shed a tear for me. I hate everyone and everything; every moment of my life is torture. I wish it would all end as soon as possible. I'm disgusted by life. I feel nauseous and I can't even stand my family. There's nothing for me in this world.
