I’ll always be alone. The last time I celebrated my birthday with someone special was 4 years ago and I pretty much had to beg this person to hangout with me.

There are only 2 types of ppl, people who hate me and people who tolerate me cuz they feel sorry for me. But no one is capable of loving me. The only person who ever showed me any hint of love was me.
