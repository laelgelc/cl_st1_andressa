I’ve given up. Truly. I think I’m going to drop out of school. And I don’t know… I guess I’ll just continue my life completely alone, like a shut-in. My old hope, my old dreams—everything feels so empty right now. I was going to be rich, you know. I was really fixated on that. But now I’m literally throwing everything away. I’m just so tired. And I think I’ll remain lonely, inside loneliness, until the end. All I ever wanted was to find someone. Someone who would stay with me and I'm for him for the rest of our lifes.
