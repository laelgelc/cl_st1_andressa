I'm having a moment. That moment when memories flood back, both good and bad. Feelings of pleasure that rip open old wounds. I long for the joy of them even though I know that they eventually shred me into a pile of tears. I want to be strong,  courageous and knowing that this path is the one that leads to peace and less pain eventually.
