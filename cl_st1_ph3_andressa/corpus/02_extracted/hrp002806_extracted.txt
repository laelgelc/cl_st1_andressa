I've just graduated and the first move I want to make is Cali. I've been so depressed on the east coast as of lately, and now that I have the weight of school off my shoulders and a lot of time, I want to spend some of it in California. I'm excited, I only really get excited when I'm about to visit somewhere new. Plus I'm caught in the hype, I'm going there hoping to feel that West Coast Magic. Is it a thing? Is it all weed, peace and love. 

What really brought me to California was Childish Gambinos Pharos concert. I'm a huge fan and I think he is the GOAT. Since I'm a loner, I'm hoping maybe I find other souls like mine to vibe with and maybe I won't feel so alone in life sometimes. I want to know that it's not me against the world, and feel what it's like to connect with people again. 

I want to be a hippie for a day. Get some CSun, smoke weed and connect. We may not even have to speak just catch the vibe.
