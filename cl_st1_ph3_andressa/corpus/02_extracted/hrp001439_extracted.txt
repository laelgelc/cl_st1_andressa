Hey everyone,
I’ve been single for about 1.5 years now, and lately I’ve been feeling a bit lonely. I’m looking to connect with someone 20+ for a meaningful relationship — but I’m totally fine with starting as friends and seeing where things go naturally.

A little about me:
• I enjoy video editing and exploring different software tools
• Big fan of 3D CAD designing
• I love cycling and playing chess
• And yes… I can happily sleep 10+ hours like it’s a hobby 😅
• Overall, I’m a mix of techie + chill + slightly boring but in a wholesome way

If you’re also looking for someone genuine to talk to and maybe build something real with, feel free to DM.
