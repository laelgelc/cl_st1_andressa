So today I was at the Coffee Shop, and I began analyzing social patterns that contribute to my loneliness. Those of you reading this can get first-hand account of the 21st century social experience.

1. People who are talking appear to already have met someone somewhere else. So, I ask internally, where did they meet?

2. People who are talking to each other are engrossed in their own social discussions. I know this is natural, I just wish I could have what they have.

3. Coffee is definitely a stimulant to one's social skills, but unfortunately, I am not partaking any social interactions, nothing but the Coffee.

  
4. There are other people in the Coffee Shop who appear to be alone as I am, but don't appear approachable, so I'm at an impasse.

  
5. It is really freeking cold! I'm going home now
