I’ve always been introverted and loved my solitude. genuinely love spending time in bed and love being single. grew up always having friends and bfs on and off. the past couple years i busied myself with the wrong crowd and began abusing drugs and alcohol, all i think as a way to mask my shyness. when im intoxicated i become normal and less embarrassed and shy like i am naturally. i decided to stop that lifestyle last year, and now have quite literally no social life. the people i used to hang with stopped reaching out when i told them i no longer want to do drugs. (I still drink small amounts.) i am a 24 year old woman and i spend my nights and all my weekends alone wishing i had friends that wanted to go out and have fun like i used to. I am attractive, yet no man ever approaches me in public and on dating apps not a single person has ever actually asked me on a date. I am a gym rat, love art and reading so i fill my time with these hobbies but it doesn’t fill the deep hole in my heart of wanting community and connection with other humans. I don’t talk to a single person outside of work. I had to delete instagram because seeing all my “friends” continuing to hang out all the time hurts my self esteem so much. is it really because i told them i no longer engage in drugs or is it because i am genuinely not fun or desirable to be around? im starting to become so depressed living a life with no one. I consider going to bars alone hoping someone will approach me. Idk maybe i have autism im just so sad and wish people liked me and wanted to hangout with me. watching girls on hbo wishing i had that social of a life lol.
