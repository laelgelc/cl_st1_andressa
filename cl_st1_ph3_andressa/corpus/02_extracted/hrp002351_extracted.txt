I'd say I feel the weight of loneliness and sinking feeling that I'll be alone my entire life once every month or less. It always passes so it's never really enough to do anything about it. I also don't feel like I can do anything about it, because I'd have to change so many things, and there are also fundamental aspects of me I don't think I can change

I think 99% of people generally dislike my personality and the way I am, and I dislike 99% of people as well. I feel lonely for somebody that doesn't exist or is hard to find. Even if I did find that person I click with I'd probably cause problems and it'd be hard in a different way.

I don't want to be inlove; I just want companionship.
