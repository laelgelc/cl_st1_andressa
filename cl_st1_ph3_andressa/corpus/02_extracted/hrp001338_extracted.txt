Basically, the fact that no girl ever wanted to get to know me more is destroying me slowly.

  
I have been on multiple dates from dating apps throughout recent years, but it always ended the same, with me being ghosted. I reached a point in life where I am so burned out that I dont want to date anymore, because I know I will get ghosted, but at the same time being single my whole life is taking a toll on me.

  
Additionally, I have hobbies, I do sports my whole life, gym, running, I also produce music for a few years now. Recently, to help my mental health a bit, I came back to playing football (soccer) in my local team, but I only played few matches because the winter break just started. It helps when I have 1 match a week, I get adrenaline rush and a sense of short-term goal in life.

  
Now, my life is just work -> workout -> sleep. I can't stand it anymore, especially during weekends when I dont have to work 8hours per day.

  
I just want to be loved by a woman, but I have no hope left... I need to be strong to survive this until my last day...

Just a vent....
