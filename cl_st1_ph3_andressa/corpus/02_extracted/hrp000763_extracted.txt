I’ve always given my everything my time, my heart, my effort. I reach out, I try, I hope. But if this is what God has destined for me if He truly wants me to be alone then I will accept it. From now on, I will stop chasing, stop messaging, stop forcing anyone to be my friend. I’ll stay in my own silence, waiting patiently, even if it breaks me inside. Maybe one day someone will come, not because I begged, not because I forced them, but because they truly see me. Until then, I’ll carry this quiet ache, this longing, and learn to hold my own heart gently, even in loneliness.
