People stopped texting. Everyone kind of forgot about me. If I'm not constantly reminding them of my presence by posting, I might as well not exist. I thought I had friends. Guess not. I know literally no one at my new college and I'm already in my 4th semester now. All of these people are "friends" on social media. The online world stands between me and new relationships like an unconquerable hurdle. Or perhaps I'm just an unpleasant person. I never get calls or texts. I'm not lonely dw. Its just something I noticed. I have so much peace of mind and don't feel the need to please people just to feel like I belong. 

But there is consequences. And idk if I'm doing the right thing or might want to change my approach in the future. Living is difficult when you do your own thing, I've realised. There's no one to encourage, appreciate or guide you, no one to tell you things will be okay. No reassurance. But perhaps that is what life's supposed to be like. Uncertain and confusing. Guess now it's all about getting used to it.
