I feel that i make all the people that surround me go away, i treat everybody like shit and i just only want someone to love and be my emotional support, i know that with my actitude i wont have that until i change, but really idk what to do, since the start of this year all of my friends stop talking to me bc an ex friend of mine that abused of me on my own house tell my friends awful things abouy me after i decides to talk about that situation, and since then my life has been shit, i quitted collegue early bc of i felt so bad going to school, everytime i see that person and remember what she did to me i feel so anxious and i just want to cry, but i feel thats therea nobody for me and im just alone, i kniw that i have my mother to talk but really i feel uncomfortable telling her that, i know thar she doesnt like when im sad and i dont want to make more problems to her.
i guess thats all idk, thanks if u get this far, it means a lot that someone can read this <3 take care
