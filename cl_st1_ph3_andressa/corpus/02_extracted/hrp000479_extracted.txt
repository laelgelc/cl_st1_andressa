I don't know sometimes  I don't understand who are my people and do that even exist, everything feels so forced in this world, I don't understand what truly being " unconditional" is, and do people really exist in that manner, I watch a lot of movies and I see how one person trust another, I wanna feel that belongingness and that love, but I'm too scared cos it's hard to beleive something like, am I phobic or do u guys relate ?
