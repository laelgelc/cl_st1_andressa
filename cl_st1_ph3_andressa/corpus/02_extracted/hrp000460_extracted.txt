This might be very weird but I think this is the best place to let this off my chest i had a dream there was a guy who is older then me (1 year older) and he became friends with me i had a great time with him in the dream but after i woke up i realized it was a dream and now i feel sad and also i personally dont know him he just seems like a cool person to be friends with and i also think i felt sad because of my current friends i have irl because i go to school study have a laugh with them and i come home feels boring do my hw scroll a bit then sleep and the cycle continues i genuinely feel bored everyday because i want to meet new ppl and want to make new friends i also thinks its bc i been to the same school for 8 yrs but idk what to do my life feels boring and sad i want to meet new ppl how do i cope with this ?????

Also sorry for my bad english i am not from a english speaking country
