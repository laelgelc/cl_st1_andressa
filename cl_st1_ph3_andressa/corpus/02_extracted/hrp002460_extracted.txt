Because sadly that's not true. Taking more care of myself, losing weight, therapy no matter what I did, i was never enough sadly. Not with years of therapy, not with losing 30kg, literally nothing. The only thing I'm hearing is "keep working on yourself, love yourself first" Great, I love this advice. Like, what the hell am I supposed to do? People also never gave something about when I felt happy. When I did love myself, now everything feels like an empty promise.
