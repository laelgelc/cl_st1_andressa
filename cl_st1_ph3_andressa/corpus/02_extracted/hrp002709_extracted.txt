I would say in one way, I feel a little guilty for not being outgoing and sociable, and that things would've been a little different in high school and college if I'd just made the decision to hang out in groups and chat, but in another way, I don't think I should feel that way because I'm so comfortable in solitude; in addition, it's hard to find people who share your interests and views and most people in the world are just nasty and judgmental.

So does anyone else feel a little guilty for being a loner?
