Il keep this brief but basically i f eel  abit weird now. There was a nice fmale neighbour my age who was here when i moved in. She move d out a few months ago. We werent besties but it was nice to have someone to gree t in passing and help out when needed and see a smiling friendly person fairly often.  Also to hear sounds of human presence. Now i dont have one on my floor itrs just me and i try not to admit it but it really changes things

life kind of feels sucky and bland now. I do have other nice neighbours in the street thankfully i can call on but..not the same? I always like living next to people i sort of feel abandoned. Not by is but the situation that it left behind

i just wake up to nothint and all day its nothing. Im not in W ork because of difficulties so life feels...like theres not anything outside of myself to distract f rom all my stuff i think about

its quiet all the time. Doesnt quite feel natural

i hope this doesnt sound too whiny but i must address it that emptiness is never ending. Have no idea when or if another will move in. Has anyone else been able to relate to that at all? I hate the feeling of total solitude even if its  more perceived. But the reality of it is honestly a bit hard and yeah i did like having her around it made life nice
