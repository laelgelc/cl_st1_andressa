I've never experienced THIS level of loneliness before, It hit me like a dump truck all of a sudden these past few weeks and I never knew I was this desperate to just be seen or to be important to someone, When I finally do meet a person it just seems like I was already too late and it just hurts me...Yes I do have friends but hanging out doesn't seem to help either even though it scientifically should improve atleast my mood, I can't focus in class anymore because I have so much on my mind and I can comprehend how stressful my life has been recently, "When there's bad there's always good" But it seems like the "Good" rarely appears, Is it a me problem? Yes I am socially awkward and yes I have trouble talking to new people but it doesn't mean I don't deserve people who see me as SOMEBODY in their life, I'm fairly young to be rambling stuff about this on the internet especially on reddit.
