Everyday i get free from my work, I take my scooty and go on a ride ( alone, obviously). I don't know where am I going, where I'll land up, what will I do, when should I return. I don't know anything. I just escape. I don't even know what from what I'm escaping, I just leave. The City, the noise, the chaos. I don't know what will happen, I just leave. 
Just like that penguin, leaving it's herd behind, going into the cold abyss of icy mountains, in the unknown.
No motive. No feelings. Nothing. Just alone.
I don't know if this is a coincidence but the story of that penguin seems very relatable to mine, and I guess , to many of us.
