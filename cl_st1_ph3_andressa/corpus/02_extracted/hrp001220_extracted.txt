I recently deleted the apps and paradoxically my loneliness basically disssappeared. 

I think swiping reminds oneself how big the sea is and how little space in it we occupy. 

Not having the apps has given me more time to focus on getting things done and start developing little enjoyable routines. 

Said routines consist of reading, drinking tea, taking the dogs for walls, rock climbing and gym. 

I suppose social media, which I'm not on, has a similar effect as dating apps.
