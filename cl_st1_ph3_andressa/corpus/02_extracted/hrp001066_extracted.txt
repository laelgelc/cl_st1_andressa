For a long time now, I’ve been noticing how the darkness around me doesn’t merely surround, it hollows. It strips the world of excess until only absence remains, an absence I have yet to decipher, sitting beside me in complete silence long past midnight. There is something unsettling about that hour, when the world feels suspended, as though even time has agreed to pause and observe.

I sit in that stillness where thought finally loosens its grip. The mind, exhausted from its constant insistence on meaning, falls quiet. And in that quiet, feelings arrive, unannounced, uninvited, as if they had been waiting patiently for the noise to die down. They move in softly, but with weight, filling the empty space thoughts once occupied.

It is in those moments that I realize how deliberately I wear my solitude like armor shaped from bleakness and desolation. I’ve learned to stand within it, even to take pride in it. There is a strange vastness here, an almost infinite stretch of inner space that solitude affords, and for a while it feels enough. It feels self-contained. Whole.

But then the feelings linger.

And slowly, they begin to expose the truth beneath the armor: that this vastness is not freedom alone, but distance. That this quiet is not just peace, but loneliness. In their presence, I feel suddenly unguarded as though the identity I forged through wounds, through endured truths and confronted shadows, is no longer solid but trembling. It is a terrifying realization: that something so carefully constructed, so painfully earned, can feel so fragile in the face of emptiness.

These moments do not scream, they rush to erode. They make me question not who I am, but how easily even a hardened sense of self can feel at risk of dissolving. The loneliness doesn’t attack, it waits and that is what makes it unbearable.

Still, no matter the weight of it, I know this much: I will not surrender myself to momentary relief. I will not trade the integrity of my being for the temporary comfort these feelings demand. They may linger, they may ache, they may threaten to unmake me but they will not dictate my actions.

So I endure, for endurance is not a choice, it is the condition under which I remain myself.
