I had this "friend" group last year, but I distanced myself from them because due to my personality and our different viewpoints, I got hurt by them (even if they did not intend it), and now I'm tired and I don't want to socialize again, because I fear it will end up like that again.

However, I do feel deeply lonely and I would want a partner whom I can be close to, trust and be intimate. But because I don't want to socialize and I have become a literal recluse in the recent months (there are days where I don't speak to anyone), I simply do not see a road where connection could develop.

Just venting.
