I imagine that like many here... but there are especially lonely days, where I come home and feel that emptiness of living alone, seeing my days go by that although I am entertained with my projects... they still feel empty sometimes. I don't use social media, I don't have anyone other than 2 or 3 close acquaintances that I talk to from time to time. 

I'm at a crossroads between not wanting a partner because I know it's not for me and feeling alone because I don't have a partner.

My work burns me out, my leisure does not give gratification, I feel hollow inside; with a slight spark of life that drives me to get up and move forward, but for what? Studying working and not seeing money at the end of the month or progress in my projects or friends that support me. Not a laugh on a Saturday afternoon, not a caress at night or a good morning kiss. 
No stimulating conversation. 

Just me, Youtube and my thoughts.
