I also have no one to share these thoughts with. 

I usually post stuff on Facebook but it seems everyone is scrolling and not actually reading my posts. I hate the reactions button. I want some engagement. 

So I’m wondering where should I put these things? 

Some of the things pertain to my town and I don’t want to put them on their Reddit or next door. Sometimes I am wanting info from locals though. I guess I could post the question on Nextdoor or local Reddit but I don’t feel comfortable attaching the situation to it. 

I don’t know. Is there really an option here?
