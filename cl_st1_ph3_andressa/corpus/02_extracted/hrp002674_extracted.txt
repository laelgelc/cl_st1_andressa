Hello all. I am just gonna come here and rant a bit because I am feeling a bit stressed.

I (M16) have always been a bit struggled with friends. My family tends to move a lot due to low funds, and the times I do get to stay somewhere, other circumstances split me up from people I start becoming friends with. Every single year since kindergarten I have lost my best friend from either class separation, them moving, or myself moving. Around 6th grade, I gave up on making friends but still made them anyway without much effort. Even with that, they still left every year. Around this time I also started getting really involved online. I met some really toxic people just so I could have some people to talk to, but they almost have "ruined" me if I had to describe the situation. Nearly their entire lives revolved around monetary income and assets, which my family doesn't have much of. They would tend to not address me without some sort of making fun of my money or my looks. Now its hard to live my life without constantly thinking about how wealthy or attractive I look, and I hate it. All it does is hurt me making friends in the real, which is hard either way with COVID. Idk, it just seems like the world is working so hard against me and it would be impossible to overcome it. All I want is just someone to depend on or talk to on occasion, but it feels like that will never happen since my circumstances have made me such a narcissistic, self-loathing, uncaring, and boring individual.
