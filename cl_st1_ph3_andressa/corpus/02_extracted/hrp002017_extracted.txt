I have a social circle and talk frequently with my family and all that. However when I come home to my empty apartment it feels weird, my stomach is all jittery and I just want to not be alone. My head keeps remind me of everything bad that has happen, my home doesn’t feel safe and I’m the one who is causing this. Am I the only one who feels like this? 

Is it depression? Anxiety? I have ADD
