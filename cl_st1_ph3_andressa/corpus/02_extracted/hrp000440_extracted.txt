I’m recently single and I’ve always celebrated Christmas with my ex (weird for me to even call her that) and new years. I’m kinda in this weird stage of loneliness where I can accept that we’re over and she moved on already with someone else but I can’t stop missing her and everyday I’m fighting the very strong urge to text her. Then I’ll realize that if she still loved me she would’ve fought for us as well. I hate that I still love her. She seems to have no love for me or maybe she’s just forcing herself to act towards me this way to make it easier. But I’m still in our apartment and she’s already moved out and it’s like I’m living in two different worlds. 

The part that breaks me is how easily she treats me like a stranger 

Being alone sucks. Unlike like her I can’t replace her as easily as she replaced me and I hate it.
