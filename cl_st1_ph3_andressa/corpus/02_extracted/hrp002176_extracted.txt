It's very scary and lonely that you are alone in this kind of time. You woke up suddenly because your dog just did something while you were sleeping and you have no one around you. No one you could message what happened or what do you need. No one you could think of will able to help you. 

You made a choice to distancing yourself from people who'd thought your forever people. You made a choice to stop talking to them hoping they will initiate the first move. You made a choice to stop caring for them because they don't care about you.
