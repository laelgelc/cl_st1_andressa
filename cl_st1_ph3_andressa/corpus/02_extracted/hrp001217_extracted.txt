Sorry for the long text, thanks for reading if you do.

I'm F26 and ever since I hit puberty, it's been really hard for me to make friends. It started in high school when no one would come sit next to me. To this day I always notice the one empty seat next to mine, even if the place is crowded.

For years I thought I just came along better with guys, but it hit me recently; they have never wanted to be my actual friend but something else. I feel so stupid. I'm craving connection and friendships with women, but I don't know what's "wrong" with me in their eyes. I take good care of myself and always make sure I smell nice. In groups I smile and ask questions, but somehow I always end up alone, staring at walls and feeling this pain in my chest because no one "chose" me to have a conversation with.

I've asked about this from the people in my life and the answers vary from "maybe you don't try enough" to "maybe you try too much" and "maybe you're too beautiful and they feel threatened". But honestly, what should I do? I have tried and I have not tried but I can't seem to find the right answer.
