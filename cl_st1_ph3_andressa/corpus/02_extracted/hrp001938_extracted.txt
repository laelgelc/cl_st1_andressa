Just one person, it's all I want. Someone so special to me, and I'm special to them. Someone I could sing songs with, be sad or happy with, just spend time with doing whatever. Maybe they'd tell me about their day, not just to make small talk, but because they actually want *me* to know how their day was, and I would want to listen. 

  
A guy can dream lol.
