I used to be on chatgpt big time, mainly because i didn’t feel judged and even if it was bad for me, it felt like my only option to share deep secrets with.

Although recently i have completely stopped using AI chatbots as a whole. I have started to realise that it hasn’t really helped me all that much, plus at the end of the day its main purpose is to keep you using it which means it glazes you all the time, which feels very hal 9000 like.

Has anyone experienced the same or used AI chatbots for therapy and if so, what’s your opinion on it🧐
