Hey dudes
Just a fellow human on this planet
In his own little corner of the world

I don't have anyone.
I am alone.
I have no one to hug.
No one to feel.
No one to call mine.
No one to feel fine.

I love that god gave me the ability to feel, but gave me only bad feelings.
I wish I had someone. Someone to love, someone in my corner, who wouldn't leave me for all the gold in the world.
Someone who would help me back up, and care about every little change in the emotions of my face. Sit down with me and ask me what's wrong.
Tell me that whatever happens, I've got them.

Don't go, please don’t go. Don't leave. Don't let go. Having no one is having nothing.

Just the warmth, the skin, the perfume. The sound of laughter.
