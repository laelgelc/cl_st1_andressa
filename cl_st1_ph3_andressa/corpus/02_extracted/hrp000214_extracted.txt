I know it may be a bit too early to think about valentine's day bc January hasn't even ended yet but I'm really curious how are you my fellow lonely souls gonna survive that awful day. it's gonna be my 5th valentine's day alone (the only time I celebrated it with someone I loved was at school and now I'm a university graduate) and for some reason this year the thought of being alone on the love day seems especially unbearable... so, what's your survival strategy for valentine's day? how do you escape the reality of never feeling loved by anyone?
