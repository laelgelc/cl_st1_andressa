How do you cope with being scared that you’ll be lonely forever? At 20 I’ve been deeply lonely my whole life. I’m scared this will be forever. As someone who has attempted, idk I’m not scared of death, I’m scared of being lonely my whole life. And I have tried so hard to be social, make connections, better myself, just keep trying but its honestly been very defeating.
