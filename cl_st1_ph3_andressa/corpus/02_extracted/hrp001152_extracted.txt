How do I stop hurting people and lashing out and pushing them away when I feel bad? I’ve ruined all my friendships and relationships. I constantly need validation from them and them showing love or caring about me cause I feel none for myself. I’ve tried loving myself and I’ve tried to enjoy spending time with myself, I just can’t what do I do? 

Next person I find to talk to I’ll repeat the same mistake. I’m just so fkn lonely. I don’t know how to deal with it. 

Without someone next to me I feel stressed and anxious and worthless and I can’t be productive. 

wtf is wrong with me.

I need to stop lashing out and I need help I don’t know what to do anymore.
