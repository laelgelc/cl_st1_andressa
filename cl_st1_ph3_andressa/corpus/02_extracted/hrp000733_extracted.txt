Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m jus there. I hang out with people sometimes, go to work, talk a bit, but it still feels like nobody really *sees* me. Like I could disappear and it wouldn’t matter much.

It’s weird because I’m not completely alone, but the loneliness feels heavier when I’m around others who seem connected. It’s like being on the outside of something you can’t touch.

Does anyone else feel this kind of quiet emptiness? How do you deal with it without completely shutting down or pretending you’re fine all the time?
