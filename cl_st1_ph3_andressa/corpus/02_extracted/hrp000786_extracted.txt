My girlfriend left me on my birthday (23rd) and she is pregnant. She is ghosting me completely now blocked on everything won’t respond to texts or calls it’s been days now. I’m honestly freaking out and in a lot of ways I don’t know if I can handle this. She wasn’t the best and we have our problems but I miss her, I miss doing things with her, I miss her smell, and her laugh. I cry all the time now and no one understands because all my friends think I’m better off without her, maybe I am but I just feel like I want to die. I long for her, I don’t feel right without her and now I am convinced she hates me. I’m just really sad. I feel like I have no one to talk to no real connection with anyone else. My life feels like it’s over.
