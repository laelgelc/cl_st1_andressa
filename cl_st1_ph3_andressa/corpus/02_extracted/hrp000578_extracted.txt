I feel very lonely and angry, I feel like my anger is becoming stronger as days go by, all I want to do is have fun and enjoy life but I'm constantly working and haven't gotten laid for over a year and I feel so angry with people that I can't even talk to them with out being mad and talking smack about what small talk things they suck at doing, like i literally hate a lot of things now
