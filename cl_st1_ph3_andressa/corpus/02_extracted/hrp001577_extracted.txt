I was here much worse a few years ago where I actually began to lose my mind from not talking to people or anyone really in so long. A great deal ahs happened to me since then. I still don't really have any 'friends', people who know me, talk everyday, stuff like that. And my only interactions are online ones, in passing.

I very seriously need contact and conversation. I don't know what to do - making friends is almost impossible because everyone is on a different wavelength to me entirely, I don't think or work like them at all and can't pretend to. I can make friends with Others 'like me', but, for that to succeed requires other kinds of circumstances...

Do the rest of you struggle with this problem? you're kind of fucked man, you know? it's find your Own kind, or essentially just go insane and die, because conforming isn't possible either \[I literally can't - it's like trying to go around kissing, forcing romantic affection for and having sex with men being straight with no homosexual feelings whatsoever. You just can't. It'll make you ill mentally trying to be something you're not. Same experience. I get the opposite experience to someone feeling like they're fitting in, I become increasingly, eventually depressingly aware I'm wearing a mask around them.\]

I also have no desire to conform to their way of being.

I cannot befriend regular degular human beings. I have tried for years. Can't. It's like two organs that don't match, there's no fit, it doesn't work. But I need people to talk to, frequently really, to well, self-reflect off of.

Like where the fuck do you find people you can just... exist around.

Isolating experience...
