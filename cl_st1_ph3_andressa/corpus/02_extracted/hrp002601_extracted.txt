He answered with the most general things that are not a part of me. I felt pathetic after that..maybe pity towards him that he never bothered to learn anything about me yet he still talked to me about all his emotional struggles opening up to me about how he thought everyone hated him...How can he trust me so easily?


Most of my interactions with him are a waste of time. We just sit there ...in silence and talk about nothing. I try to initiate a converstation even though I know it is a waste of time I still do.
