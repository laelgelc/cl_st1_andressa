I want someone to love me unconditionally. Someone who cares about what goes on in my mind. Who will check up on me every hour of the day. Who will take care of me. Who will want to understand me. Who will listen to me. Why is it so easy for other people to find love? But it is so hard for me? Is there something wrong with me?
