I am 20 years old. I wanna become pro boxer and trying to put all my life around that dream. I don't have friends and I don't talk much with my family members. I basically don't have anyone in my life. Recently I started feeling lonely and I was trying to handle it somehow but I don't know how. I tried to add some new hobbies so there will be variety in my life but problem is still here. 

Is there anyway to handle loneliness without having someone in my life?
