Hello, I've been searching on reddit to find friendship online or at all to be honest. I haven't found anyone, people either want a quick conversation or we never end up playing any games together. Recently, I've been trying to find someone to start a terraria playthrough with but that doesn't work either. I'm starting to think that maybe reddit won't work and I'm supposed to be alone in this. Don't you feel the same?
