I have nothing rn. No job, no close relationships, no passion for anything anymore.

And today I lost my boyfriend. Going back home on christmas eve after getting kicked out by him and his family.

I need some hope. I dont want to feel alone, im scared to be completely alone and isolated.

How do I start over without having anyone to lean on?
