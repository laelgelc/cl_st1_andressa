my ex broke up with me oct 10 and since then I’ve been extremely lonely and depressed but been able to get through it because my passion for work, I’ve just been working and working since then. But I woke up in the middle of the night this morning and my calculus exam was graded after waiting 2 weeks. 

I’m taking this class accelerated and fully online (no zoom), I was expecting an A or high B as I studied profusely but there was one issue when I submitted the assignment I didn’t submit both pages of my work on accident, so I emailed it to my professor immediately. Long story short my exam came back as a 30/100

I sent a followup about 2 days ago and just sent another and although she answered very quickly originally she STILL hasn’t answered any of these, I’m losing my mind now, and a lot of sleep over this, I already went to bed late. Now more than ever I want a girlfriend that can comfort me, The past few years of my short life I’ve had that and it’s a part of me now, I don’t know how to function without it, maybe thats another thing I should be working towards alone so I don’t have to stress out my future partner or bother them constantly, but I’m at my breaking point I’m trying everything I normally use for comfort but nothings working my head hurts so bad and I just need someone so bad, I want someone familiar and I want to be cared for. If this exam grade isn’t change I’m so screwed it’ll be my 2nd time having to retake a math class.
