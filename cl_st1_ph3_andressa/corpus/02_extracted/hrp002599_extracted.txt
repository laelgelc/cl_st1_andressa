Am I a loner, or am I just really good at being alone?  

Or just bad at being with other people?  

Do I feel bad that I'm alone, or do I feel bad because I'm alone?  

Do I not want to be with other people, or have I just not found people I want to be around?  

What's the human interaction threshold for lonerness?  How many days straight alone is enough?  

Would an actual loner feel the need to post about it on reddit?
