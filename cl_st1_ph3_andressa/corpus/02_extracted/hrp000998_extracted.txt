i dont understand why im so alone

maybe im trying to hard to make someone attracted to me, but i dont think it will ever be enough

i dont know if its the way i talk, i act, or the things i say, im a respectful person, and respect ppls privacy when they need it

maybe im always trying to comfort them when they dont necessarily need it

my friends have boyfriends and girlfriends, and theyre all so lovey-dovey in front of me with it and it annoys me badly

i want to be loved by a girl, i want to build LEGO's with them or watch a movie, or draw, or walk, or watch the sunset, cliche things i know

but i just want to be loved for once, i want to do things with someone and be their special someone, and i want to BE someones special someone

but im only 17 and i dont understand how most of my friends have girlfriends or boyfriends, theyre the same awkward, nerdy dummies they are

judging is fine, i dont rlly care because it rlly does sound like im a needy motherfucker and need attention 24/7 and that im jealous of my other friends, but im not

i just want someone, and thats all i want in my life right now, i need a person to escape reality from for just a few hours, or longer
