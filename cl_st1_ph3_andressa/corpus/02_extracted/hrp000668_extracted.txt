Hey fam,

I've been through some really deep loneliness myself, and now I'm working on something to try to help with social/emotional isolation.   
But before I go further, I need to understand how others experience it - what the common threads are, what actually helps vs what makes things worse when it comes to words and comfort.

So I'm just looking to chat with people who are going through this or have been through it. Either over coffee if you're in Lyon, France (my treat), or a 20ish min call.   
It's confidential, I'm not selling anything, no personal info needed. It's really just to help me understand the patterns that keep showing up, find what connects us all, and also give you a moment where you're genuinely heard.

If you're down for a talk, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for reading.
