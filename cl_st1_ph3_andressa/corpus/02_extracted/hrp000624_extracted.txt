This is the first year I won’t have anyone to celebrate Christmas, thanksgiving, new years, or my birthday with. I’m an orphan and no contact with my siblings. I just ended a really long relationship, I’m in a new state that I don’t know anyone at. I’m just alone. It’s so strange cause usually I’m with people when I feel lonely. I don’t have the money to do anything for myself so I’m probably just gonna stay home as if it was all just another day. I’m not necessarily sad about it, but it feels so strange not having anyone. I hope you guys actually have plans for the holidays, and I hope you have fun.
