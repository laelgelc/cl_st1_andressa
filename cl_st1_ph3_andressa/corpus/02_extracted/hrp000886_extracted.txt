2 divorces

Full time Dad to my 8 year old son.

I try to hang out and connect with people a lot. Usually socially drinking and hanging out with other people in town but I am not feeling any kind of spark or true connection with anyone. There are no girls to date.

All of my online dating efforts are fruitless. 

Im self employed which is nice and i enjoy talking with my clients a little bit. 

But im generally just depressed, alone... not lonely all the time but im definitely depressed and uncomfortable. Seems like everyone else has pleasurable interactions.. but im always on the outside.

Last girlfriend i had was fun but also physically abusive. She got arrested twice for it and still to this day tries to angle that it was all somehow my fault...

Idk what the point of this ramble is... just speaking to the internet
