How do I make friends who actually live near me and want to hang out with me? I am so lonely. I have been lonely my whole life. And honestly...I am tired of living. I have a family now so I cant do anything drastic and I dont think of the worst outcome each day but I havent looked forward to anything in a long time. I cant find a job to even have any human interaction with. And if I work with clients in homes, I am still isolated. I have no adult human to speak to who is at least on the same intellectual footing as I am. I am autistic and have my own shortcomings too. I just want connection. And if I cant manage to make connections, how the hell can I teach my kids how to connect? I dont want them feeling this same way. I feel so empty. I make no difference in the world everyday.   
I am 30F. Newly diagnosed as autistic even tho I have always known something must have been wrong with me all my life because otherwise I probably would have actually made friends. This post probably wont be read or if it is nothing can be said. I know others feel the same way tho. I guess we arent alone in feeling isolated and alone. But how does knowing others feel this too help us at the end of the day?
