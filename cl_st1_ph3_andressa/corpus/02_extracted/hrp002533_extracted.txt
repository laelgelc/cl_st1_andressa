I’m writing this through tears and honestly not even sure what I’m hoping for by posting. I just know I can’t keep holding this inside anymore.

I recently had to walk away from someone I love deeply because staying in their life was hurting too much. They were the only person I talked to every day, the only one I felt truly close to and now that connection is gone. The silence feels unbearable.

I don’t really have anyone else to open up to. I’ve always struggled to make friends and I don’t have a support system I can lean on, so right now it feels like I’ve lost everything at once. The person, the routine, the feeling of being wanted or seen.

I keep breaking down and crying and I don’t know how to stop. My chest hurts, my thoughts won’t slow down and all I want to do is reach out to them even though I know I can’t. The loneliness feels physical, like something heavy sitting inside me.

If you’ve ever felt this kind of loneliness or grief, I’m really sorry. And if you’re reading this thank you for listening.
