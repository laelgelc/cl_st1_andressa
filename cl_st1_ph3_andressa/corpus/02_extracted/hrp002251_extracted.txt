Im in my 30s with barely any friends and i would like to make some but i dont know how. When I’m not at work, I spend my time just smoking weed and playing video games Alone.  I don’t really have any other hobbies Or interests.  I tried to do everything from  music to religion to sports to pet ownership and I’m simply not interested in anything so therefore, I  don’t meet anyone or have friends and I’d like to make more, but I don’t see how I can because of how boring i am.
