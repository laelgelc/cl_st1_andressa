I have zero friends. I have work colleagues, and a family, but I do not have any friends. I haven't made a new friend in about 25 years, (I am a 51yo M) and every person I thought was my friend has just sort of faded away over the years. I stopped trying to make friends some time ago, and now am at a point where I have given up on ever having friends and I now assume I have nothing to offer in that regard.

What is worse, is being stuck in a bad relationship as I fear loneliness and have no real support to help me leave. But, I don't think I'm a bad person. I'm just sick of pretending I have even one person I can call a friend without it being a stretch. I have felt ashamed of this for many, many years and tried to hide it. 

I don't know what I expect from posting here. I just had to admit this to myself.
