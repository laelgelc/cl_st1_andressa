I'm working 50h per week because I have nothing else to do. I'm training 15h/week because I have nothing else to do. And I still have free time to realize how much life suck and I'll be lonely all my life. How do I even meet people when people on dating app just want to flirt virtually forever and then ghost ? I'm literately willing to pay for irl friends but I guess I'm such a bad person that nobody even wants to do that. What's the point of life ?
