I had to move from my country to another one five years ago to protect my life, for political reasons. I had to change everything in my life, start a new life with a new identity, and become a completely different person.
I adapted and grew to love this country. I went through major psychological and financial ups and downs, but I managed to stabilize and improve my life.
Today I am 38 years old, alone in a way you cannot imagine. Even though I am a positive, ambitious, intelligent person and I speak five languages, I no longer know who I am. I remain suspended between my old identity and my new one.
I no longer even know how to make friends or how to meet someone..
