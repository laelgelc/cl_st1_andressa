I have so much to say and so much that i feel but no body feels safe to express all of it to. Im really tired . Ive lived like this for years now i should be used to it but its gotten harder after a break up i went through. I just hate how whenever i open up people never tell me things that actually help, no one really understands. And i can survive in my own ways i have my methods but when i just imagine a person that holds me for all my flaws and tells me what i need and want to hear it all just hurts more. I've resorted to venting on Reddit because that just feels safer than actually opening up to people no ones good enough
