Honestly everyday I am alone. I'm 28 almost 29 and I'm still alone. I live with family. Day in and day out I don't have anyone to talk to really. I try to talk to people online but that doesn't really work well. I can be very friendly but I've noticed that seems to scare people off. I would enjoy something in person but everyone I talk to is never near me. And I can't drive because I have no license or a car. And I have mental issues That make even the thought of that a nightmare. That make even the thought of interacting with people a nightmare. I've never dated and that makes it worse. Because I still have the desires and yet nothing and not for lack of trying either. But I don't have the mental capacity for self-esteem or drive or whatever to do. Any kind of relationship. I'll take friendship because at least in that capacity I'm not alone. I'm so sick of being alone. And I'm a guy by the way. That seems to drive ladies off especially online since too many other guys have been creepy scumbags. I don't like long-distance relationships of any kind. I'm not looking for a date. Because something tells me I might be a little too broken for it. Oh and I'm broke because I have no job. Which means I have nothing to bring to the table at all. So I'll be happy just talking to people temporarily if that's what it takes continuously even if it's a disappointment when it always inevitably ends. I have a discord. And I don't care what gender you are. I don't care what sexuality you are. I don't even care what species you are at this point. I'm talking to a damn cat or myself more often than not. And I don't even understand why I even put this post out there. Because I'm not expecting anything to come of it.
