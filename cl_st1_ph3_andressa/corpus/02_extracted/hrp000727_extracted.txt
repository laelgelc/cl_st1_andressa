Hi... I'm just a socially awkward disabled adult, (31) Looking to meet people around my age with  common interests...

Please note that I have trauma and trust issues due to past toxic / mentaly abusive relationships... so I take a while to warm up to people... but I really wanna get out there again...

Things I'm obsessed with

VIDEO GAMES!! 
(Some of my faves)
Life is strange
Spyro the dragon
Crash bandicoot
Ratchet & Clank
Skylanders
Psychonauts 
Sky cotl
Beyond two souls
Heavy Rain 
Detroit become human 
Until dawn 
The Quarry 
Final fantasy
A way out
It takes two
Split fiction

Cartoons!!!
(Some favorites)
Invader Zim 
Grim adventures of Billy and Mandy 
My little pony 
( and pretty much anything that was out late 90s, and early 2000s)

Drawing and designing cute cartoon characters! I do mostly digital, but I do traditional from time to time!

Movies!!! Mostly Disney and horror/thirller 
(Really obsessed with Chucky and Scream!)

I live in the USA and run on Pasific standard time

If you're around my age and share common interests please let me know and if I feel we match well I can DM my Discord! ^^

Please don't message if your just going to immediately ghost me... I'm sick of that happening... I'm looking for long term friends who want to chat and hang out frequently.. if you are not able to commit to a friendship please don't offer it.... :(

I also can't grammar for my life.
