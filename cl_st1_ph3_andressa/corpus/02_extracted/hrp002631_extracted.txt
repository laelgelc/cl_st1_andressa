What are your reasons for being a loner?

For my reasons:

* Freedom. I find being a loner more freeing and fun. You don't have to worry about being around others.
* Maintaining relationships. Simply put, it can be a chore to keep in touch with people all the time.
* Shitty people. Humans can be awful to be around with like those kind of people who will judge you for not fitting a certain societal norm, take advantage of you, or will treat you like crap for their own sadistic pleasure.
