There are times were I am like "yeah, I'm a proud loner!" but then there are other times were I get sad over the fact that i'm so lonely and sometimes even cry inside, I thought I was a loner who can handle it being by myself, but why do I sometimes feel the very opposite and feel like i need some connections.. Who am I?
