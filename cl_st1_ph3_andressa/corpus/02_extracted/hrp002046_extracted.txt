I'm 34M about to be 35, I have my own place work two jobs. I have two boys (15&8), I have them on my days off. I've just started to feel so sad and fkn alone this past few years and it's getting to a point that I'm literally starting to lose hope in any future happiness for me. Im just sitting here with a rock in my throat because I don't have friends. I don't text anyone. I'm constantly thrown to the side from the people I try to text. I'm ignored and disrespected. But there's nothing else for me other than to beg for replies. Online dating is just non existent. And I'm at a lost.
