Serious question. I worked through lunch every day this week, stayed late four nights, answered emails at 10pm, canceled weekend plans to finish a project and in our 1-on-1 yesterday, my manager said "I lack commitment to the team." I wanted to scream. I wanted to flip the table. I wanted to quit on the spot but I didn't. I nodded and said "I'll work on that." I went back to my desk. And then I realized... where do I even go with this anger? There is no place for me to go and just scream my heart out. So I just... swallow it. Every single time. I know I'm not alone in this, am I??
