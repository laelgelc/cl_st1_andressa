Virtual Friend

Hey everyone. I'm 25F, black African. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in having a virtual friend. We can talk about virtually everything on video with you, provided it is respectful. I don't mind meeting new people. 

I am reachable through my socials here: https://www.rentacyberfriend.com/JUcRJTF0eryrznr/

See you stranger!
