I became a loner at 13. My father is a religious Muslim who forbade me from socializing with girls and drinking alcohol. I hated sports. I belonged to a religious minority. Most of the other boys talked about gaming or music but I had a passion for movies and TV shows. At heart I was an individualist. This made me a loner.
