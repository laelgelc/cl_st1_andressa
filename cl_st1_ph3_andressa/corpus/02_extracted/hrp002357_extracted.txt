Many people in my family support me, but they don't understand my suffering due to my lack of sociability, especially my mother. She is one of those people who think it's a matter of maturing or doing other things in your life. When I try to explain it more deeply, I simply don't know how to put it into words, and it's painful because I know in my heart that she really wants to understand me.
