These last few years I had a feeling in the back of my head whenever my birthday came around, like I just wanted the whole thing to end and it made me feel like shit because it is the only day of the year I get attention from my friends and family but I wasn’t enjoying it. At first I thought it was because all that attention had no reason nor merit rather than just existing but that explanation didn’t feel quite right.

Later I realised why: they serve as a great moment to show all the friends I lost, all the friends that actually don’t give a shit and a reminder of how lonely I truly am. Most of my friends whom I consider closest (or at least thought would have the decency to text a few days later) didn’t care in the least bit and whenever I celebrared it one of two things happened: either no one came or quite some people did but in reality ignored me.

This year just four friends remembered and almost a quarter of my family didn’t say a thing, but it’s ok because I no longer care. I guess Phil Dunphey from modern family was right, if you have zero expectations people won’t dissapoint you.
