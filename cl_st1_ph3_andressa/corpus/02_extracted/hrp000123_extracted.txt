I don't really talk to anyone when I talk to new people its like we talk about the same things. But that's okay I think. Whether its to vent or to just chat it'd be nice to talk to someone about something getting advice and ranting or yapping. Just for reference I'm 34 M. I may not be someone you want to talk too and that's okay but I'm open to talk to anyone though.
