I think I may be depressed because I don’t really enjoy anything anymore I’m realizing life sucks I mean nothing really adorable anymore so I can’t really enjoy myself and I can’t even buy a lot since most is consumed by taxes and bs insurances. I feel like I reset every few years so I go back to having no friends I’m an extrovert and I can’t really control it since I never grew up with siblings to talk to so it’s a way I express myself I just need someone to talk to. I like videogames and art. I like music too so that I can escape from reality.
