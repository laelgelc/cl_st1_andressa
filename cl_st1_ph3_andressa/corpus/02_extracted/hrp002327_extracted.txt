I've been feeling pretty shitty again. This is just a post to kinda write about how I feel and maybe someone just wants to talk? 

Life comes with ups and downs, I'm in the down period agian. I feel lonely, empty, cold. I just want a warm feeling, a nice compliment, just a nice conversation. 

I feel like doing nothing at all but I'm also bored. Everything feels suffocating. I fockin hate this.

The weather's down aswell so that doesn't help either. 

I just miss certain times and certain people. 

This post is going from one thing to the other, sorry. I'm just writing what's in my mind. 

Anyone wants to have a nice conversation? Maybe we can be online friends! I do play some PC games so maybe game buddies?
