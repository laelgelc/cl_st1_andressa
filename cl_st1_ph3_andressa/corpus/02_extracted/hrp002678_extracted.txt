I know I’m a loner. I’ve accepted it most of the time but, sometimes I can’t. I have no Social skills idk how to get any. I’m a failure in life that I had to repeat a grade. everyday i come to school i hate everyone here with a burning passion. i have the urge to just yell at everyone everyone. all these kids skip school or don't do any work at all but i always get sent to the office. there's this one kid that always tells me to get a gun and shoot myself, i might as well do it. there's no point of being in this dumb earth with dumb people and kids.
