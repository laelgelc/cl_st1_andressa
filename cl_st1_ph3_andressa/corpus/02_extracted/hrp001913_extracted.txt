Posted here before. Raised in an extremely isolated environment. My parents didn't want me to be around anyone else as a child or young adult due to the idea of being "spoiled" by the evils of the world (it was part of their prophecy, it's a long story). But the point is, being tainted by the evils of the world wasn't an option.

My parents never had friends, and said that friends were something that you didn't actually "need," that it was a lie created by the evildoers to convince you that we needed communism. 

So now that I'm an adult, I also still don't have any friends. I have found that anything that "normal" people need friends for, money can buy. It's worked out just fine for me for all my life. 

But, I'm at a point right now where I am getting older and want savings, stuff like that, and I'm feeling less generous than I was when I was younger. I don't know that I want to buy someone's time anymore, just so that they can say good morning or goodnight in exchange for hundreds of dollars a month. 

So, I've cut everyone out who I don't want to be hand feeding anymore, and I'm feeling what I felt when I was very young. What people call "loneliness." But, in reality, it's only because I am choosing not to afford buying people's time anymore. I still have to pay an ex a considerable amount of money every month because she says it was like any other job, if I am not going to continue to give her money then we are going to court. 

So, loneliness really isn't real - it's just because I can't or don't want to pay for (whatever it is) anymore. It was nice getting a "hi how are you doing" text message from someone online, only if it was to be followed by "I need $200 to make this months rent." So, loneliness isn't actually real - the real problem is money. This makes sense, right?
