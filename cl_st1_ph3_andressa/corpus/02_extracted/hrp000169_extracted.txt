Hey folks any one free to just talk. I have ranted out but nothing seems to work. my wife is tired i am tired of finding a job. should i just give up and wait for the next opportunity. why is everything so difficult.   


marital relationship- strained because i am jobless and have mortgage on top of my head and credit card bills.  


friends- i dnt have many, i only have a few. all are assholes addressing to a human emotion is considered to be a taboo. no ones seems to help with any referrals or any kind of inputs. 

Mom & dad- getting old and i need to support

sister- very elder and did not have a good relationship with her anyways. 

  
Finally job- omg i make sure to find the worst of the managers where ever i go. i really do not know what i am good at. I have just done 13 years just working baseless without anything in mind i go the opportunity i went for it. i did the best i could. 

  
I really do not know what is next. But being jobless has become a norm now. have you guys ever went thru where you find yourselves ok everything is on track and suddenly your not.
