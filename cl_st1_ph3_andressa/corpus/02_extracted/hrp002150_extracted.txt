I (31f) do all the things you're supposed to; hobbies, try to make friends and put myself out there, workout, put my mental and physical health first, self care blah blah blah. None of it feels fulfilling when I'm not in love with someone.

I feel so stupid for having that be at the forefront of my mind constantly. I should be able to just be alone and live my life as an independent woman but it feels like part of me is asleep. Numb. I'm not willing to lower my standards just to have someone there anymore, that always ends up hurting more. I'm the idiot that gives 100% immediately when I like someone. I have so much love to give, to the point it's overwhelming, and everyone says to just use it for myself, but I feel broken because it's just not the same. Simultaneously too much and not enough.

I know I'll find someone somewhere someday, I feel it in my bones my love won't go to waste. I know one day I'll feel butterflies again and tell someone I love them and mean it with all my soul. It's just the waiting that kills me. The big empty waiting. 

I hope everyone is keeping warm and finding comfort on this Friday night.
