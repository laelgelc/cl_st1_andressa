I 25m have basically lost all but one of my friends and have no one else. While I was locked up everyone basically left. Even though I work damn near a full time job I have been home for 4 months and still live with my grandma. That means dating is out of the question. I have no clue how to make friends. Some days the loneliness is bearable but lately after being ghosted I have been feeling the crushing weight of the loneliness and I don't know how much more i can take. I never thought coming home from prison would be so miserable
