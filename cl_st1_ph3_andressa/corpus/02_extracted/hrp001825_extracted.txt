I am going to sure something that makes me feel utterly pathetic. I am so starved for someone to be next to me, to just have that presence. So as a result at night, I have one pillow that I wrap my arms around and basically cling my whole body to. It feels like I am a little kid with a stuffed animal, that I can never get a real cuddle so I have to resort to using a pillow for a pretend cuddle. I feel so pathetic and worthless and this is one of the many reasons why.
