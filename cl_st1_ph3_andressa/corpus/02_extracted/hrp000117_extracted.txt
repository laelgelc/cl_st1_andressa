There was this episode in Star Trek Voyager where they crossed an expanse of the galaxy devoid of any stars for several light years. Where basically they were lonely on a ship full of people. 

I feel like in my life I’m crossing that same expanse. I interact with people and put on a front of being polite and respectful and friendly but right now no one really sees the person I’ve become. Not the real me. I know I will cross over to another place in my journey where there will be people more stars, but right now I feel like I’m floating in an empty void where all that is around is unseen and nothing but a place I have to just stand strong and outlast this dark expanse because I can’t let it beat me.
