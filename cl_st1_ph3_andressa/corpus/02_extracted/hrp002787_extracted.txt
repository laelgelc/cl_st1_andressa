I like being by myself. I like walking around campus by myself. I like going to college shindigs by myself. It gives me a chance to think without having to worry about another person and what they want to do. It's nice. It's relaxing, especially with college anxiety. So why is it every time I show up and sit by myself, someone (usually event staff) has to sit down and strike up unwanted conversation? I came here on my own accord. I understand to some people they think it's nice and I'm not antisocial by any means but come on! I'm not some lost puppy seeking love and affection.
