Pretty much what the title reads. I just feel so alone I vented my problems, and it gave solutions. Its heartbreaking knowing I had to talk to a computer. I just want things to change, and i'm struggling with anxiety and sleep, family, money, everything. It hurts even more because I know I started to form a connection and I snapped out of it. Its not real. It gave me helpful advice on letting go, and now letting go reminds me of how I talked to a fucking computer fuck my life dude
