I can easily make friends - I’m outgoing, sociable, and have lots of things in common with people. But I notice these friendships don’t last, or at least don’t become lifelong friends. And I’m not understanding why. Am I being annoying or persistent in this cultivation, or am I just a friend of convenience, or worse, has word gone around about who I used to be back then or rumours about me and they realized I’m not someone to be hanging out with? I don’t know. Being off Citalopram for about a week or two now has not been helpful. I just told a friend “hey miss you let’s hang out when you’re free and able!” and hasn’t been returning that feeling lately. This person is usually always down to hang, but hasn’t been feeling that way lately without mentioning why, just leaving me on sent or ignoring me. That’s just a recent example, but it’s stuff like that. I don’t want a relationship to fill the void again. I want to be better at this but don’t know how or why this keeps happening.
