Honestly just turned 18 a few days ago and feel terrible really , I thought about taking my life at 15 , then 17, and now still think of it just tired of it all , I haven’t lived a bad life by no means just don’t feel loved , I know my mom loves me my dad and so on , just can’t get my self to feel it I’ve never been happy with anything I do never trust much of anything people say that’s good about me , just kinda want it to end want it stop really, never had a girlfriend been asked out many times just can’t reach my self out to grab it , why love me when I don’t love me self is something I say all the time and why I turn it down , my thoughts are if I can’t be happy I can try to make others.
