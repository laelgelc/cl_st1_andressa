I really wanted to go on a date with him and he said it won’t be a date. We will just meet up. I feel there were parts of him I felt he didn’t like me. Then there were parts he wanted to help me. 

But the words he told me that he is talking to someone else. I feel he won’t be good for me. He told me he is bad for me. 

My friend says he doesn’t like me. 

I feel he doesn’t like me and he played me. He told me he’ll get me flowers and he’ll come see me. I don’t wanna talk to him anymore. 

His stomach also broke from eating beef. 

I don’t think he will be good to me. I just want to forget him.
