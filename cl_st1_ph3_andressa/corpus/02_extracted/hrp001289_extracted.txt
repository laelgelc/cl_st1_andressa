Hum New Year p health, habits, discipline ke resolutions lete h,
par mostly 1–2 hafton mein sab drop ho jata hai.

I’m not trying to teach habits or motivation.
My thought is simpler:
what if someone just acts as a reminder + points out the real hurdles when you slip, and brings you back to why you wanted the change in the first place?

I’m trying to understand if this kind of accountability is actually helpful, or unnecessary.
Honest opinions welcome — what would make this useful or useless for you?
