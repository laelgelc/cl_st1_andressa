So on January 2nd my sister sent out a group text chat to my entire family.  She said that she wanted to do a family gloat trip on the f fourth of July and to check our emails for information.  I waited a few days and checked my email for the information.  There was nothing there. I text her asking if maybe she forgot or needed my email address.  She responded with "this is for couples only". Just another reason why I can't stand a single member of my own family.
