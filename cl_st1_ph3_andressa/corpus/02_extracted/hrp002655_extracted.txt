There are pros and cons about being a loner whether by choice or not by choice (Mine wasn’t by choice). One pro I just thought of is last year, when everything shut down, it didn’t affect any friendships as I was already used to being alone. It’s something that made me feel better. 
If everything shut down again, that’s one area of our lives we don’t have to be concerned about. We don’t have to worry about a lack of hanging out with friends, etc. 🤗

I do feel bad for the people that can’t handle being alone though. 😔

We have some amazing traits that can even be seen as rare. We’re very unique 🌺
