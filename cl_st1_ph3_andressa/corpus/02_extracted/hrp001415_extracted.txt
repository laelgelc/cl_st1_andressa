So when I was a teenager I moved to a small town and I live in the sticks. I don't really have much reliance on this small town other than its close for work and shopping. I feel disconnected from all people in my community. My job is mostly friends and family and people who know one another very well. We also hire felons so there's that. Maybe I need to avoid places like that. There is literally no training or leadership at my job. I figure everything out for myself or communicate a problem or something that I don't have time to do or know how to do and get no one to step up. I am single-ish but that's a whole other problem. I am also neurodivergent and an INFJ personality so loneliness is inherently part of my cross to bear. But what helps with that? Anything to ease that?
