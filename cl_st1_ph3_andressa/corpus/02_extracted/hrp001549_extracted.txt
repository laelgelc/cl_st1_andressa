In Contradiction  
  
I find myself at a strange point in life—perhaps age, perhaps circumstance, perhaps even divine intervention, or its absence. I seek connection with faith, yet I am unsure if this is a search for God, a longing born of loneliness, or a nostalgia for the friends and certainty of my once-religious childhood.



Do I feel lost, or am I merely discovering? Is this a reinvention, or a return to a self I never truly left? I do not know how to feel, yet I feel intensely. I know myself, yet I ask: who am I, truly?



What is found, and what is lost? Will I gain, or lose, in the search? Will I discover something eternal, or merely the reflection of what I already am?



I move forward in contradictions—drawn to certainty, yet comforted by doubt; seeking answers, yet clinging to questions. I step into this unknown with my eyes open and closed at once, a witness to a life I remember, yet do not yet know, a journey I follow and question with equal measure.
