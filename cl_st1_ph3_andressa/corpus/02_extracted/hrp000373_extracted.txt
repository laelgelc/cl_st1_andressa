So, I think it’s worth saying I’ve had some bad encounters with people in my life and I’ve lost all faith in others. Seen some really horrid and incompetent things.



Question for you guys, have you deleted all social media & also removed gmail calls and texts from your phones or hidden them? Do you find it peaceful? 



I’ve also recently focused not at all on social relations and just on enjoying life, my work and bettering my life. And it’s been amazing. Fuck people fuck friends who turn out to be shitty, Can anyone else relate? 



Also do you have any tips that have made your life better or more peaceful in this regard? 



Thank you
