I've been directing my energy into plants this year. Starting way too many from seed, I have a full collection now. School is done for the holidays so I have nothing but time. I have no one. That's mostly out of necessity to maintain boundaries, but it's been really quiet lately. 

I talk to my plants. 

I raise slugs. I talk to them too. 

I utilized AI to help me choose a drink today and ended up in an argument about sobriety. 

Grape lemonade vodka is tasty. 

Music has been filling some of the silence, but I keep cycling the same familiar, and it's making me feel loopy. I don't want anything new. 

Existence is weird.
