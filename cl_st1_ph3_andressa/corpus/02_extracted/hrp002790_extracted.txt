To be honest I feel like I'm getting myself to be the typical teenager because it'd be unhealthy for me to not do it. All my life people told me I was mature for my age. I didn't feel successful though. Sure I didn't get bullied, but it felt..off? I've never been diagnosed with mental disorders before, but now my parents says I have OCD, and depression, someone on the internet said I may have ADD. It just feels off that this is now popping up in my life. So weird. Any thoughts?
