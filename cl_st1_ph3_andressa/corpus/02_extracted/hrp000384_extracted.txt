Over here it is school holidays for a few weeks so obviously  places are crowded when I go out. I have no friends online or in real life, and my loneliness is just getting to me-seeing others have what I don't and I'm afraid I'll get worse.
I nearly had a breakdown a few days ago going out for lunch and seeing others right in front of me have what I don't. So I'm worried if I go out today (I have to anyway) it will get worse. 
It's hard enough going out seeing others while I am alone, then coming home, online I don't have anyone  either (I HAD a close online friend, but they hate me now).  

(Before anyone asks or lectures me,  therapy and 'hobbies' have never helped)
