im a 35M from spain... i have been alone all my life and i cant take this pain... its just too much... i feel so very very empty. without someone to love and care for, this life isnt worth living. there is no point in anything

i dont like to go out or socialize. i have depression and asperger too... so finding someone who could want me is almost impossible...

i just cant deal with this pain and this emptiness...
