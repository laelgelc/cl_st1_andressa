Hey yall. Just need a source to talk to . Get some things out there off my chest. Writing helps sometimes. 

Im reaching out today because.. Man. Ive been abandoned and left by MANY MANY people through my whole life. Important and non important.. I am 30 years old, the past 6 months. Ive been absolutely killing life man.. Bills. Work so hard. So hard. Help take care of my nephews. My cat that is 6 years is still healthy as a ox and doing great. I have a great home. Always have money in my pocket. Im a decent 7 out of 10 id say.. But yet... Nobody. Not a soul wants to spend time w me it seems.. And it truly hurts.. Finally shot my shot w a girl again. First time in forever. And its really beating me and my confidence up. Iwas very happy. She was always going out if her way to speak to me. Hang out w me at my work station. Talk about music. I was so lit that a girl was flirting w me because. Me... nope. How could i have been more wrong? It sucks. And hurts man.I worked up so much confidence. Just to get shut down. Friends all live more than 10 hours away in a different state.. everyone i ask to grab a drink or grab food or hit an outing. They never want too. And I just cant seem to understand why??. Whats wrong w me that nobody wants to spend their time w me.. nobody.
