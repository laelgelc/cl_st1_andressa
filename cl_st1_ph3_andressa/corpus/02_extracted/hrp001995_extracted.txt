So I'm a 54M and pretty introverted in a lot of ways. Recently I've been trying to get comfortable with being out in public and  even looking to make a friend or two....I haven't had one of those in eons...not since the 90's I think... I don't drink but I love coffee so I do my computer stuff out at different coffee houses with the goal in mind of saying at least 1 nice thing to a stranger. I did that the other day so the next time I have to say two things...my goal is to build up to a whole conversation.  Sounds so silly and dumb to myself but I gotta do something. I used to be so social back in the day.  And oh yea, I think Reddit and other social media can count towards social interaction too especially when it's difficult. ☕
