My name is Ella and I’m looking for friends and stuff. I don’t know, I’m just really lonely. I have a hard time making friends just because I’m so introverted and i literally hate everyone at my school. I don’t care how old, what kind of background (as long as u can speak English), or what you like, I’ll be friends with you. I want a best friend. 

I like texting a lot, I also sleep a lot lol. I hope maybe someone will like to chat :)
