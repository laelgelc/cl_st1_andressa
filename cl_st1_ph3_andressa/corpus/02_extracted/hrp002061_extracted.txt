Hello! My birthday is in a few days and it's always difficult for me, but as the years pass it's only becoming harder and idk why. I think it definitely has to do with my childhood and cptsd. Maybe I put too much pressure on the day to be fun. 

Truth is, I feel incredibly lonely and empty. Idk what to do with my life, especially on my birthday. I feel quite okay with ups and downs, but as a recovered suicidal person my birthday stays a sensitive topic. I invited some friends over but they can only come in the evening. Some didn't even respond to my invite so idk if people will come. I feel a bit guilty or silly to invite people over. And I also don't know what to do the rest of the day when no one can hang out to distract me from my difficult feelings. I always cry on my birthday and it makes me very sad and confused to even think about the day. 

I had a partner for the last 2 birthdays which made it a bit easier. But now I'm single again. Anyways, does anyone else experience difficulty around their birthday, and what could I do to make the best of it? Especially because I'm gonna be by myself all the time? It's such a difficult thing each year, but it keeps getting harder. I don't know what to think of it. Does anyone have any theories on why birthdays can be so difficult?
