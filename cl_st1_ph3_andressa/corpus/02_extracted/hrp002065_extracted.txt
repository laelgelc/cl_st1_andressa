Well, I don’t have a lot to say, but it’s my birthday and I spent it alone. It wasn’t bad, I had some good food and a nice walk, so I can’t complain too much.

But I was alone, it felt weird to be completely alone on my birthday, it’s not like I usually have a lot of people around or do something grandiose for my birthday, but I never celebrated it alone.

Anyway, I hope that you are having a great day!
