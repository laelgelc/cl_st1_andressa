It's not that I'm afraid of people or that I'm anti-social I just really enjoy being by myself and being left alone. This is possibly the most selfish thing I could do. And I love it. I've always been a loner like since high school which was early 2000s. I was the oldest so there was a span of time where it was just me and honestly it was wonderful. Maybe that's just something I've always tried to seek out, that feeling of being alone again,  being a child and not having a care in the world and just living in my own mind. 

Whatever. 


Just thought I would share.
