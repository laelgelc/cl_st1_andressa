This is seriously not funny, I've lived my whole life feeling like I look somehow wrong. I've never had any friends, I've been dumped a lot, any guy I've ever liked has never show any interest in me. All my friends thought they were better than me, and I was really fed up with it. Sorry for the broken English, I'm using a translator.
