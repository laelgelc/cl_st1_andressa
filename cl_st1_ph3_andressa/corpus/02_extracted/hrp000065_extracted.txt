i poured a bowl of cereal today, then realized we had no milk. so i had milk less cereal. I know a lot of people really like this, but i dont. but i still ate it because my parents were still in the room and i had to make it look like i was at least attempting to take care of myself. thats all, you can carry on with your day now.
