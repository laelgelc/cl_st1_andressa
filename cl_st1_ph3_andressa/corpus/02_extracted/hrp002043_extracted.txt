hello, 25m here with borderline personality disorder. obviously, for anyone who knows about this illness or experiences it, having a social life is about as hard as it gets. people don’t have the time or energy to put up with you, and the ones who do will eventually get sick of your sh\*\^. All this to say, I am, for the most part, utterly alone. 

I just got a double promotion at my job, and it’s a big deal, or at least, it should feel like it, but it doesn’t. I haven’t told a soul about this huge leap in my life, not because i don’t think it’s important, but because, well.. i don’t have a single person to tell. my coworkers are happy for me of course, they’ve told me how proud of me they are.. but idk.. it just feels kind of lonely. I come home after accepting a big promotion and.. nothing feels different. Nobody feels excited for me, nobody is patting me on the back, nobody cares because there is nobody.

I want to feel happy for myself, but I am reminded by the deafening silence and chirping crickets that my accomplishment means nothing because it doesn’t change anyone’s life but my own. I know, i know, i shouldn’t care about anyone else and just be happy for myself and what i’ve accomplished. I get it. But i don’t feel that way. I want someone to be excited for me. I want.. I want someone who’s excited every single day to be around me.. to hear back from me.. to see me, to have an opportunity to get to know me just a little more every day. But that’s the borderline talking, that’s the constant need for attention, for affection, to be recognized so that I can feel for even a second that my life means something to someone and that if i were to disappear tomorrow, that even 1 person might shed a tear.

Go me, I guess 🥹
