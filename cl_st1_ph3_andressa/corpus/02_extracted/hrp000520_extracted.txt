So somehow I've made it to 46 having never gotten to experience any sort of real relationship. I did try to make an effort in my early 30's to go out to clubs and at least got to dance with and make out with a few women but that's about it. If I got a number I'd either overthink my way out of following up or if I did I'd probably came across as too much cause everything was so new to me and would get ghosted. It's been a lonely existence. I've kept busy by focusing on work and family. At this point in the game I don't see things changing from the pattern that I've been on so far. Just wondering if people could share what I'm missing, the good and the bad. How does it feel to have someone in your life who actually wants you and loves you like that? I have no idea and doubt I ever will but maybe I can gain some insight from your experiences. On the bright side I'm pretty much at the halfway point, of existence that is,  and if I've made it this far I can probably make it till the end whenever that may be. There were times when I was younger that I didn't think I'd have the patience to wait till the end. I wanted out. I know that there are more and more people who have had to soldier through some version of this experience lately. Just know you're not alone. There is something beautiful about observing life from the sidelines. You come out the other side without any battle scars just a feeling of emptiness but in the end I guess we're all alone.
