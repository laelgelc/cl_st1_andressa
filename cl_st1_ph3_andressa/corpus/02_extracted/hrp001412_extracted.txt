I want a monogamous relationship.  A romance where we go on dates and have sex after; familiar satisfying sex.  And I want to celebrate holidays with a special someone...  I actually want a lot more than that, but what I described would be a great start.  However, folks only want to be friends with me.  I'm chronically friend zoned, because I'm a good friend, but I can't take another cutie wanting to just be friends.  I do the friend thing, and I ask "how was the weekend with your girlfriend?" or "how was thanksgiving with your girlfriend's family?" or "how was your wife's trip last weekend?" and the goddamn compersion is killing me.  I want to be a girlfriend!  I want to be a wife!  Before you criticize my friends, I will share that I genuinely want to hear about their lives, and it would be easier if I had my own significant other, but I don't, and it's beginning to feel more difficult to remain supportive.
