I trained my model and it’s working amazingly. I honestly didn’t expect this, but I don’t really have anyone to share it with right now 🥲. For the first time, I feel like hugging someone because I’m happy after such a long time 🥲, but I don’t have anyone 😭… no boyfriend, no crush, no best friend nearby. I do have a bestie, but she lives so far away 🥲.

Now I understand why my counselor told me that if I don’t make friends or partners, and if I don’t reduce the boundaries around myself, I’ll be left alone. I used to think I’d be happy alone because I love being by myself, but right now it really feels like a bad thing ... because you can’t share these happy moments with someone close. She once said that when you work in companies and get weekends off, you’ll want someone to chill with, but if you don’t put your boundaries down, you won’t have anyone 😭😭.

I really miss someone right now 😔…
