I’m a high threat individual by nature of what I am, evolutionarily people are pressured to stay away from me, and I am supposed to be the sect of bad genes wed out by getting eaten by predators. So it makes sense, it all makes sense, because I have an overlap of every trait hostile to human evolution as a man who is non-masculine, attaches to non-human objects and has high sensitivity along with autism.

The FBI keeps track of people with mental illness, does that mean every mentally ill person is a criminal? No, but they are considered high threat and their mental illness is the reason for it. I belong to those groups they watch.

Every developer, every government official and every psychological expert agrees that men having attachments to fictional characters is inherently a sign of danger and requires deprogramming. This was the root cause of all my social exclusion the mere moment my mask chipped and I failed to hide that I get attached to non-real characters in the way that’s not okay (being sad over canon).

The smartest most talented people in the world agree these men are dangerous, are you going to still say they are somehow all wrong and just haven’t met the right individual? Does it matter that they do even? No, so I recognize I deserve my circumstance, it’s karma in nature’s rules.
