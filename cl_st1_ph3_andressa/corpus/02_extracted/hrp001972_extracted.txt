To preface this vent, I (24F) feel like I have never fit in, but particularly with peers. In grade school/high school, I hung out with the people who didn’t fit in anywhere else. In college, I made a couple friends, but then Covid hit and everything was online. At jobs, I tend to have the best relationships with people 10+ years older than me. I have ADHD and am probably autistic. I have very intense social anxiety that is constantly reinforced by situations like the one I am about to describe. Currently, I am at a job I transferred to about two months ago. When I first started, one of my coworkers told me they were going to add me to a work group chat. I said okay, and didn’t really think anything more of it past that. I was, however, never added. Yesterday, I asked the same coworker how a different coworker was doing (she had surgery and was supposed to start back working at the beginning of the year.) She proceeded to tell me that they started a new group chat and was supposed to add me in it. She said they had been talking about how my second coworker was doing. I told her I am not in it and have not received any messages. I am kind of unsure how to feel as three of my coworkers and both managers have my number. I make a conscious effort to talk to talk with and engage them about things besides work. I do feel rather lonely in life in general, especially at work, and this just reinforced it. Not sure how I’m supposed to feel, but I am kinda bummed.
