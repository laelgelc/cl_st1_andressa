I’m trying to meet some new people and make a few friends. I prefer talking to people 18+, and I really appreciate people who are real, blunt, and to the point. I’m an open book, so feel free to be weird, honest, or straightforward — I actually like that.

A bit about me: I’m into horror, music, and creative stuff like writing and messing around with AI art. I’m pretty chill, easy to talk to, and I don’t mind slow or late-night conversations. I’m just looking for genuine people who actually want to talk.

If you want to chat, feel free to comment or send me a message. Tell me what kind of movies or music you’re into, or drop something random about yourself. Looking forward to meeting some new people.
