Looking for chill adult gamers 21+ that loves all sorts of games, books, etc. Any sort of hobby we would love to discuss it. Men, women, lgbtq+ are welcome to hit me up. This is a base set of friends looking to expand our group to play dbd, fortnite, etc. Help others group together for any game, or you can hang out in a solo one player game and still kick it with us. We welcome you all, just leave all negativity at the door and enjoy life. Hit me up if interested - we want gamers of all platforms!
Also will be adding tabletop games to the mix like DND
