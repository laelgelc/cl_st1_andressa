Not trying to be dramatic, but… what happened to people actually wanting to know each other?
Everything feels like: options, dopamine, ghosting, “don’t get attached,” “keep it casual,” and half the time people act allergic to sincerity.
Do you think deep connection is rare because:
everyone’s traumatized/tired,
attention spans are cooked,
dating apps trained us to treat humans like a catalog,
or we’re just scared of needing someone?
And for the lucky ones: what did real love / real connection look like when you actually found it? Not the fairytale version—what did they do that proved it?
