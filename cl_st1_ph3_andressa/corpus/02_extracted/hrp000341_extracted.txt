No matter where I posted or shared it not one person replied, but twice bots told me that I was breaking some rule and that I should take it down. it’s a poem about loving someone, and I wrote it so that I could maybe find someone to love, but now I just feel worse than ever. It’s been up for over a month now. I’m just a fat kid you have seen at school, and I’m just the guy you scroll past online. I think the reason I posted here even is just to feel less alone. I try to know so many people, but I don’t think any one of them is even interested in me enough to consider talking to me outside of school. The worst part about all of this is that I know I’m not even deep. I’m having thoughts that so many other people have had. When I’m lying in my bed looking at the roof I’m not discovering any secrets about myself or thinking anything that’s gonna change my life. I’m just a fat kid. I’m not a poetry kid. I’m not a hard working kid. I’m not a super smart kid. I’m the kind of kid who posts on a fucking subreddit to act like the thoughts I’m having are more deep than they are.
