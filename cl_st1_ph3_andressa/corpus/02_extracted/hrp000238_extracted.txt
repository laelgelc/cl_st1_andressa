The trick to not feeling aad about lonely is confidence

Never thing negatively of urself.
Assert ur confidence. People automatically now feel more comfortable to talk to you cuz u aren't some unconfident asshole u just self deprecates themself.

Also try to avoid talking unnecessarily long, everyone is tired at the end of the day, unless u absolutely need to talk in detail, then only do, otherwise silence is better, everyone stays calm.
