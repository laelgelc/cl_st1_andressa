No one will ever genuinely love me for me. The only time I've been approached were times when men just wanted me for sex or to use me for my body. They were either creeps or players who were the overly charming casual friends with benefits type of guy. I am not good enough or attractive enough for any man to bend over backwards for me or go out of his way for me. I am not the type they want to make happy or please I am the type of girl they just want to use for their benefit when they know I am lonely or vulnerable. I do not want to put myself on dating apps anymore even though I've done it before because it really felt like I was just screaming "I'm desperate with no rizz and I can't pull anyone." That's all going on dating apps says about me. It's so insulting the way I only attract creeps who want me to send them pics. That is pathetic to be the only reason a guy would ask for my socials. 

 Anyone of decent standing wouldn't need to go on dating apps because they would be valuble enough to be pursued. I'm just in the clearance section or the tossed donated hand me downs bin at a thrift store. I can't trust anyone wouldn't just take advantage of me or have good intentions and obviously no one is going to try to win me over or prove themselves to me so if I don't overcompensate no one will stay. I'm easy to drop and too insignificant, useless and irrelevant to leave a mark or effect on anyone who sees me. I'm at best a rebound they are just settling for if I'm anything but not tje one who got away or the first love. I'm not even in the equation to begin with that's how irrelevant I am.
