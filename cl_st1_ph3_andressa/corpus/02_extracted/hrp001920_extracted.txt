I’m 31 Life feels gray and endless I’m fucking drained.

My mom, the people close to me they can’t handle what I feel.

Sharing myself gets brushed off, like I’m too sensitive.

I feel guilty for pulling away but I need to protect myself 

Most days I’m just watching life pass me by

Loneliness hits hard. Waves of sadness and anxiety out of nowhere.

Maybe someone out there gets it 🤷‍♂️
