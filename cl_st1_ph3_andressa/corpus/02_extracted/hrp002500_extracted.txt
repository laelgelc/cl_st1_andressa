I feel so lonely even though im surrounded and I have people I can reach out to, but I won't because I feel like I am inconviencing them, I honestly should things have started getting bad again. I feel so out of place aa well I feel like my current friend just tolerate me they don't actually like me. I realized I also don't have many friends I never did and it's just terrible, I try and try and try to reach out to people and it's never enough there is  nothing to feel this hole in my heart and this shadow of lonlieness that follows me around.
