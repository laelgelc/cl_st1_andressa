i dont have many friends and those i do have i feel like i take for granted. i feel like once i get a boyfriend my life will be complete and everything will suddenly be perfect. if not that, i at least think my life will be better and i'll stop feeling so lonely. maybe its because im touch starved, i usually go a long time without even getting hugged. i really just want a romantic relationship so i can be someones first choice and so i can feel loved and feel like i have something worth living for. i dont know if i should try to make more friends or try to get a boyfriend or just move on and accept that im alone. and i know that i have a lot of time to get a boyfriend in the future but i dont know why i should have to wait. also i have social anxiety so being around people is difficult so im hopeless
