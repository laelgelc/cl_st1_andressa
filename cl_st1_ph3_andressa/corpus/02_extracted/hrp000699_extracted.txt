I was always alone my school life no friends cause I am a bit introverted but if someone is friendly with me I am the most talkative but yet no one wanted to become my friend after my school 
  

   I got enrolled in an university and it's been 2months and I am fearing here it will be the same because I have not made any good friend it's so depressing 😕  

I made some online friends also and they texted me for some days we talked but I felt I was the only one starting the conversation so I think let's see if the reply first and to my surprise it's been 1month and I am still waiting 😄
