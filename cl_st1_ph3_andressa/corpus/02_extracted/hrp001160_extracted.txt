i (f22) throughout my entire life have always struggled socially. any friend group i think back on even in elementary, i seem to have always been left out. i never seem to be able to fit in somehow even when we have many similar interests. when i was younger, it was not getting invited to bday parties or being left alone at recess. as ive gotten older ofc its different things like not being invited to go out for example i was left out of a new years party. granted, the situation is a little complicated w this friend group bc me and my gf of 3 years recently broke up and we share friends. we agreed to be civil and we do still live together as of now. however, we were still together before then and i felt like i was unknowingly left out of plans. i was told i shouldn’t have assumed i was going even though i went previous years! and now they’re going clubbing without me, something they all know i’ve been wanting to do since i turned 21. its almost like its on purpose to intentionally hurt me

i guess the gist is i dont understand why im so unlikable. its almost like id rather have no friends bc then i wouldnt be left out of activities and have to deal with fomo. all my life ive just assumed somethings wrong with me everyone knows about but me. sometimes i thought it was bc im maybe annoying or something but any time id voice concerns my “friends” would say it wasnt true and that they value me as a friend but like? i dont know

im mostly wondering if anyone has felt this way and how you deal with being left out all the time.
