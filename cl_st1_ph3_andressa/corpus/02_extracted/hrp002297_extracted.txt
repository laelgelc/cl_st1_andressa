Like the title says I feel lost, seems like everyone looks at me as a means to a end. Been a caregiver for my spouse over 20 years. Everyone tells me how I am so good at it, but nobody sees how it impacts me. I have emptied all I have into caring for family I don't even know what I like anymore. All I do is work, do things around the house and sleep nothing really appeals to me. I just want something normal.
