Given the loneliness epidemic, a lot of people are missing social connection and social skills.

Of course making friends is the best solution, but if socialising is difficult and you really just need a chat and don't have someone to call, maybe online conversations with a stranger (like on Zoom) could be helpful as a short term, immediate measure.

It could be an opportunity to practice social skills and build your confidence with someone else who also needs a chat.

I called two loneliness hotlines one day and neither of them answered my call. Being vulnerable enough to call and then not getting to speak to someone. That was a hard day.

What do you think about this as a business idea?
