It was a late Friday night, and I was staring at my phone screen. Outside, only the dim glow of streetlights and the occasional sound of passing cars could be heard. The room was so quiet I could hear my own heartbeat.



“Are you asleep?” I texted my best friend, Lin.



Ten minutes passed, and the screen remained dark.



The next morning, Lin replied: “I slept last night, what’s up?”



At first, Lin would proactively ask if I was having any difficulties, but gradually, his replies became shorter and the intervals longer. Until three months ago, when I texted him again late at night, he replied bluntly: “Sorry, I’ve been really busy with work lately, and the pressure is high. I probably won’t be able to chat with you as often.”



Those words felt like a bucket of cold water. I suddenly realized that in expressing my loneliness, I might have become a burden in his life.



Lin had just been promoted, had a two-year-old daughter, and his parents weren’t in good health. The occasional weariness he showed in his words was genuine. And me, a thirty-year-old single working in a foreign land, my “loneliness crisis” seemed so insignificant compared to his real-life pressures.



After that, I learned to be silent.
