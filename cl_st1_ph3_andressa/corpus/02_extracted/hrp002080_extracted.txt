This is more something i'm genuinely curious about than a vent post. For all my life, as long as I can remember, i've always been ignored in social settings. In real life and online. No one's ever really bothered to pay me any mind, and in any group i'm the one forgotten about. A lot of times people outright ignore me when I try to speak to them.

Anyone know why this is? It's uncanny, it's like everyone can sense i'm not worth interacting with. Like I have a smell attached to me (that can somehow be smelled through the internet too) This happens in very varied environments, so it's not a case of my reputation preceding me. I'm friendly and polite to people, and I don't give off a standoff-ish or mean vibe. 

What gives? Is there a sociological reason for this? I'd love to know
