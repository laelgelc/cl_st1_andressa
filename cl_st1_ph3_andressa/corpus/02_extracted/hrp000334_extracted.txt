I'm a good person, not too chaotic, I play video games, go to the gym, nothing out of the ordinary, and I'm somewhat social.

What's making me so angry is that I can't seem to fit in anywhere, and I'm fed up.

And as for romantic relationships, forget about it, they're a complete failure.
The whole problem is driving me crazy.
