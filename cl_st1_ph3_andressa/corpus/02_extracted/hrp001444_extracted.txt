Hi, I’m Alex! I’m 23 and looking to make some new friends to talk, text, or just vibe with since most of my old friends are busy with their own lives. I’m pretty chill, work out a lot, and I’m also a gamer with a PC, PS5, and Xbox, so I’m always down to chat or play something together. If you’re looking for someone laid-back to get to know, talk about life with, or hop into games, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to meet new people and build real friendships.
