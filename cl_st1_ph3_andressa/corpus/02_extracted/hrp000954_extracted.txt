I’m not talking bout the book or TV series. I’m really curious, not in a depressing way. Never got in a relationship and never felt mutuality and still think that there’s no mutual love in this world. Wants some tips or stories. On either how you got your partner or what to do not to die alone. Feel free to share your stories and thoughts.
