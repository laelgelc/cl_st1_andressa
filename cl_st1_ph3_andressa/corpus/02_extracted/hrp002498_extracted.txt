22, and I just can’t do it man. I really shouldn’t complain cause I have two close friends In the same city, and one that lives away, and thats more than some people have. But I still feel so alone, ive never really had a relationship, (even though its my own fault, ive never asked anyone out) and im in school right now but making friends just seems impossible.   


Im a guy but tend to prefer friendships with women, but im socially awkward  and scared if I try to make friends with any of the women in my class they will think im creepy and trying to hit on them or something, I know that’s probably totally irrational and if I don’t act creepy then it’ll be fine. But im so painfully awkward im sure ive made women uncomfortable unintentionally. I just dont wanna get in peoples way, thats how it feels if i try to socialize, like pulling teeth and im bothering the other person 

And then the whole never had a relationship thing, which I feel like a total loser for even complaining about, cause as I said if i had just asked a few people out in sure someone would have said yes to me, but the idea of rejection scares me so much, I just avoid it

I feel like a defective human sometimes.
