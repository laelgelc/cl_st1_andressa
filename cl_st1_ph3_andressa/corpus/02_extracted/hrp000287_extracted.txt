chicken butt. hello. i feel entirely disconnected from everyone in so many ways. i feel like when i talk about it, the people close to me relate it back to their own experiences and project their situation onto me, except for my dad. this isn’t what i’m looking for from this post!!! but i want a relationship so bad it aches. again, when i talk about these things, i never feel fulfilled. i never feel like i’m resolving anything. i have a sneaking suspicion that the reason i feel like i cant be comforted is because i cant give it to myself, and i cant give it to myself because it was never given to me, so in turn i cant comfort other people the way i want to. its a really lonely feeling, it makes me want to stay quiet about my struggles forever and never speak about it because whats the point if i never feel better? if can never just get relief from what i’m feeling in that moment? but maybe i’m just looking for instant gratification. i had someone once who comforted me in a way no one else wanted to, or could. thats what made me fall in love with him. and it made me feel like a child (im not that far off, check my bio) when he was comforting me, but in a good way. i don’t know if i want to live without that for my whole life. is it bad to want that? to crave that feeling? i don’t know what i’m talking about anymore, just dumping my thoughts at this point. but i would love it if i could talk to someone. i don’t need pity, i’m not a damsel in distress or whatever. it’d be great to chat with someone though.
