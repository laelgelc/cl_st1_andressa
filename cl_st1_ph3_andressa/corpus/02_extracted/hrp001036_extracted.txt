I don’t know how to explain the kind of loneliness I mean without sounding dramatic, so I’ll just be honest and let it be ugly.
I’m not lonely because I don’t have humans around. I’m lonely because I can’t find depth. I can find small talk. I can find flirting. I can find “wyd” at 1 a.m. like it’s a personality trait.
But the thing I’m starving for is the kind of connection where someone actually wants to know you—not just the version of you that’s easy, funny, agreeable, or hot.
It’s like we all say we want connection… and then the moment someone asks a real question—values, fears, what you actually want, what broke you, what you’re building—people slam the door and call it “privacy,” or they dodge, deflect, go silent, or pivot to sex because that’s safer than being seen.
And yeah, I’m touch-starved too. But sex isn’t the first hunger.
The first hunger is being met.
The first hunger is someone staying in the conversation long enough for the real stuff to show up.
Also—why do people act like distance is the main reason something can’t be real? Since when did “miles” matter more than character? You can be in the same room with someone and still be alone. You can be across the world from someone and feel more understood in one hour than you’ve felt in years.
I’m not asking for a fairytale. I’m not asking for someone to save me. I’m asking if anybody still believes in connection that isn’t negotiable, isn’t performative, isn’t a debate—just real. The kind where two people are honest enough to be known.
If you feel this kind of loneliness—
the chest-ache kind, the “nothing touches it” kind—what helps?
And if you’ve ever found real depth with someone (friend or partner), 
what made it different?
Because I’m tired of living on crumbs.
