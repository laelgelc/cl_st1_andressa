I just want peace and be able to talk to myself all day.
Disconnecting w people is such a slow journey, I'm Regretting making friends because it's hard for me to leave them on good terms. I dont care about being able to socialize again. I accepted that if I became a loner again I will loose that ability, it's just how I am.

but I belive this is just how my true self is.
It's exhausting to talk to people or just be in a space with others. If I'm alone again that won't matter, so it won't be so exausting. That effort to do everything right for the people who love you It takes up too much space in my brain and doesn't let my track of thought flow properly, and that bothers me a lot. I feel too overwhelmed by not being able to move forward with my ideas in a public space I hate it
