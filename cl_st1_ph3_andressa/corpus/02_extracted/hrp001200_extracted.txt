There comes a point

Where getting a message on your phone seems like a rare occurrence

You hear the sound of the notification pinging through the room

And your heart starts racing, receptors experience dopamine overdrive  
  
But it's usually just a meaningless message or some email you've received

When that shouldn't be the case

I experienced this for a while

It may have been somewhat peaceful

But deep down, I realized how lonely it was

When I did the math

I noticed that I hadn't held a decent conversation with someone (not small talk), even in real life, for weeks

Work for 8 hours, small talk with co-worker, leave, sleep, repeat

Life can't be that stale

Old friends are all living in different cities, we hang out 2 or 3 times a year where we meet up in a planned spot

Everyone's busy with their own responsibilities

Few messages that show up on birthdays

And that was pretty much the jist of it

There must be way to change the dynamic

And I acted on it

Stopped waiting for a connection to randomly show up 

Stopped waiting for destiny

Forced it upon myself to start putting myself in places

Where there was a chance of forming a social life

I didn't chase people down

I didn't try to force convos

I'm just a guy who tried to change the conditions I lived in

And slowly

My phone wasn't just a device I used to doom scroll social media before falling asleep anymore

You can do it too

Don't get comfortable with isolation, it may seem peaceful, I get it

But if it's bothering you deep down, do something about it
