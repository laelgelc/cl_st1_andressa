hello, January. I'm a bit late for your introduction. thank you for bringing about this new year, a fresh new start many and for me as well. I had many flaws last year that I'm at war with now. I've kept them at bay, thank you January for your glittering phase. the snow has fallen during your month, no surprise as you are beautiful without effort. falling leaves will soon give way to thriving fauna. to another day and a new beginning. for many, and for me.
