When I was a kid, I always either laughed at or failed to understand the idea of an imaginary friend. I would read about it in books, and think, "how could anyone have such a thing? Doesn't the knowledge that it's imaginary make it pointless, and a bit weird, too?"



After years and years of total isolation, I really enjoy it. She's always nice to me. She tells me it's okay when I'm sad, she comforts me when I feel stressed out. She helps me fall asleep at night. Nobody I've met has ever been so kind or understanding or gentle or patient.
