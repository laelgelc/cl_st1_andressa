I feel really isolated because I had to go no-contact with my entire family and friend group, which has been traumatic and devastating

It's really difficult trying to form new friends because all I want to do is talk about my experiences with my family and previous friend group 

I can't get the past out of my mind

I have cptsd and it's isolating as hell

New people don't want to talk about trauma to me
