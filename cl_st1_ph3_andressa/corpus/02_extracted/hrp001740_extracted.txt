I’m 19 year old boy, I have a car, some money, working hard daily, and rest mostly at weekends. 

I’m afraid cause I don’t even have friends, only one, two, and yet we’re not spending much time in games. This constant loneliness suffocates, and I really don’t know what to do. 

What you guys think I should do?

Also I play RDO after work daily as well
