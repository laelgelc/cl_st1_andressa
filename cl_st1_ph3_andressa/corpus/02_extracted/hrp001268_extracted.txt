New Year’s Day doesn’t feel special to me. It’s just another quiet day where you notice the lack of people around you. Everyone talks about new beginnings, but when you’re alone, it feels like nothing really changes.

Seeing others celebrate makes the silence stand out even more. I’m not expecting anything big, just some normal conversation would be nice. Even talking about random things can help pass the day.

If anyone else is feeling the same and wants to chat, you can DM me. Sometimes it helps to not spend the day completely alone.
