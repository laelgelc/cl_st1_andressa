All my friends are too busy for me. N they end up ghosting me. I'm not sure if they just hate me to be honest. Ever since I moved, I lost all the people who even bothered to give me the time of day. I'm fucking 15 for God's sake. I should have a social life...

I'm trying to make friends here ig.
If you like Harry Potter (Fuck JK Rowling though- transphobic mongrel bitch,) playing Stardew Valley (if you wanna do a joint farm that'd be cool, Vulture Culture, Wilbur Soot, or generally anything n just are chill, then feel free to message ig. Thanks for reading anyways!
