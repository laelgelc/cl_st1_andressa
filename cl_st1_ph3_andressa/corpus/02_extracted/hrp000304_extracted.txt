I don't need to be someone's #1, just to be up there on someone's mind.

I have C-PTSD ingrained in me, so that's probably why I feel unwanted. I met someone who I thought was the one, I ended up getting used instead. What made it hard to refuse was the fact that a lot of people supported us to be together. Because then, it would seem as no one will finally be left alone. It seemed almost perfect that the two loners in our space would be interested in one another.

I think it hurts a bit more when there's someone who wants to be close to you and you want to be close to them but there aren't enough things that click between the two of you. There was a small chance but some things can never reach a nice compromise, like personal values.
