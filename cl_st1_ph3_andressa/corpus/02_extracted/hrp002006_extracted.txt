tbh its just exhausting. like we talk every single night on imessages or whatever and its so easy. i can actually be funny and say stuff that doesnt sound stupid because i have time to not send it.

  
but in person its pathetic. i want to say something so bad but the irl version of me is a total glitch. im terrified if i try to make a move or ask her to hang out she’ll realize the guy she talks to online isnt actually the guy standing in front of her. its like im catfishing her with my own personality if that makes sense? i’m just tired of being brave only when my phone is plugged in.

  
i plugged our texts into [rizzly.ai](http://rizzly.ai) and it said there was a 85% chance she liked me back - i know its not always accurate but i honestly agree with it. i just wish i had the balls to actually take the next step
