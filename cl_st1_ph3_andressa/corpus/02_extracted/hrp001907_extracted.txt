9 months ago I (32/m) had the worst mental breakdown I ever had. I suffered in silence, staying up late to cry when no one was around to see me. Then, just as I began to surge through it and get a grip something horrible happened. After a late night taco bell binge I began to feel what I thought was just a case of heartburn. Turns out I had a gallstone that got lodged in my bile duct. As the night went on it got worse, but I endured. We planned to take me to the urgent care in the morning if it didn't improve. All this time that gallstone was causing my pancreas to slowly digest itself. This resulted in a horrible case of pancreatitis that kept me in the hospital for almost 6 months. I could not eat, I could barely drink. Most of the time I was alone. I had a couple of surgeries, many procedures, a tube running out of my stomach and another into my liver. . . I still got the liver one for a few more months. I was walking body horror. I hated existing. I lost over 60 pounds. 

You want to know the worst part. Friends and family complementing me on how strong I was being. My own brother said he wouldn't of been able to go through it. The truth is I'm not strong. I wasn't brave. I was loosing my shit. I went numb to everything. I didn't feel fear, not because I was stronger than it was, but because death wasn't the worst case scenario. Every time I was put under, no matter how dangerous the procedure was I embraced it for the small chance I might not have to wake up. I was lonely long before being put in a sterile room with constantly beeping machines and nurses coming in every 4 hours to poke me and take my vitals. I got a candida infection, sent to the ICU, forced to pee in a jug for half a year. I experienced some of the worst pain in my life, and I've gotten live root canals before. I'm finally starting to feel better, but I feel the mental pressure building again.

I'm tiered of being strong.
