Hello. My memory is selective; I forget many things, but fewer than most.

When I was young, I had a handful of friends, then only one. He became my closest companion simply because no one else remained. We spent our days playing, passing time without purpose. He never challenged me, yet I enjoyed his presence. We ate together every day in the school cafeteria.

That was during primary school. When I moved on to secondary education, we drifted apart. We still lived in the same small town, but the connection faded. Sometimes I see him from a distance. I’m not sure if he notices me or remembers anything. Perhaps not. Perhaps I prefer not to know. I will not reach out; he could, if he wished. I don’t initiate contact with anyone.

Solitude is intentional. Yet if someone appeared-someone intelligent, friendly, and capable of offering real challenge-I would respond in kind.

People occasionally try to speak with me, and sometimes I feel the need to talk as well, briefly. Then the conversations end. Maybe I should be gentler. I turned twenty-five this year and had no friends beside me. At times I felt “lonely,” but being alone remains the most valuable thing I possess.

The noise of people-their agitation, their self-absorption, their inability to listen or remember-exhausts me. So I play along. It is considered normal to be kind, to support others when they are low. Some have tried to do the same for me, but their expectations never matched reality. What they wanted wasn’t what I needed, and the opposite was just as true.

So solitude is enough. It keeps me content. I am nothing to anyone; I could disappear and no one would notice. No one would sit in a church wondering what my thoughts once were. I write this as a kind of memento mori, or perhaps out of a detached need to speak. I’m not sure.

Thank you for reading. I hope you are doing well.
