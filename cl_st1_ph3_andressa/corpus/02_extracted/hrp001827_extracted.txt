This is a genuine question.

I don’t have a partner, I don’t have friends, and I don’t go out with anyone — not even casually. By “going out” I mean very basic things: having coffee, talking, spending some time with someone. This hasn’t happened for years.

I know there are people who live like this and are actually okay. Not in a “I don’t need anyone” way, but genuinely functioning and mentally stable.

In my case, I’m not okay. The loneliness affects my mental health, and that’s why I’m asking people who already live this way and manage it well:

How do you structure your daily life?

Where do you find meaning or emotional grounding without close relationships?

Is this something you learn to be okay with, or is there a key mindset or habit that makes the difference?

What helped you the most to avoid falling apart?


I’m not looking for clichés or empty encouragement. I’m interested in real experiences and practical advice from people who’ve been through this or are currently living this way.

Thanks for reading.
