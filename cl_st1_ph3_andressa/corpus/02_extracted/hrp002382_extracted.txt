So tired of being lonely. Never truly wanted, never good enough, merely tolerated. Tired of walking into my empty apartment, suffocated by silence.  Tired of being stuck thinking about people who have long forgotten me because I never mattered to begin with. Tired of feeling like I'm less than, that I should settle for whatever and have no standards or self esteem. Tired of being an eyesore, of people acting like I'm not even there most of the time and acknowledging me with disgust the rest of the time. Tired of feeling like an inconvenience. Tired of restless nights and tooth aches from clenching my teeth. Tired of having to get out of bed in the morning and pretend it's all dandy. Tired of being me, of this being me life. Feels surreal.
