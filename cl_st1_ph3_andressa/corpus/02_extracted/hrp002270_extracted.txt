I just can't do this anymore. Am i so vile, that it is necessary for everyone to leave as soon as i enter a room? I already eat lunch at work alone, sit outside alone during my break, talk to nobody and watch videos. Yes, i know my Karma is low (i believe in Karma) due to the way i hurt people in the past, but i am working hard to change all that. Still doesn't help. I am a burden. 🤷‍♂️
