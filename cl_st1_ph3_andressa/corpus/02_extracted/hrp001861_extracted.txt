F, 30, very, very lonely and hurting.

Since I moved cities to go to college, I lost contact with almost all of the people I knew. Not that we were good friends but I hopedfor at least a bit of contact before we lost each other but it happened immediately. 

Collage was terrible. I made almost no friends, couldn't click with anyone at all, save for one girl and our friendship survived our both graduating.

I found job in that city so I've never returned to my hometown but people I work with are in completely different stages in life and our interests do not overlap at all, so we don't have any deeper bonds.

Not gonna lie, it sucks.

I spent most of my days alone and while it's horrible, you get numbingly used to it. However, lately even my friend from college just started ghosting me. I don't think I did anything to offend, she's just drifting away. I tried to reach out but she's leaving me on read.

I'm trying to made my peace with it but tonight it really, really hurts. I wasn't very confident person in the first place but being ignored like that was really a hit. I wish I could make friends, like maybe find a dnd group or anything, but every time I think about reaching out to a stranger I just get too shy and can't do it.

I guess if I can't change it I will have to beat it but.... I don't know. I just needed to get it off my chest.
