I've been isolated so long, I barley know how to talk to anyone other than my parents anymore. I feel embarrassed with myself, I feel like others know a secret to socializing that I'm missing. I try to talk to my co-workers, but I get nervous about saying the wrong thing and stumble over my words, making them look at me like I'm an alien. 

I hyperfixate on nerdy things I'm embarrassed to talk about with others. I struggle with self-esteem and have a hard time talking to others due to my severe body acne scars and dark spots that I've tried practically everything to get rid of. I'm always wearing long sleeves and long skirts, even in the summer. I worry that others may accept me even less if they found out what my skin looks like.

 I'm 19 years old and I still can't drive or have a normal conversation in person without sounding ridiculous... I feel like maybe  I really am an alien. I just wish I was normal sometimes and acted like a normal person. I'm embarrassed to exist...
