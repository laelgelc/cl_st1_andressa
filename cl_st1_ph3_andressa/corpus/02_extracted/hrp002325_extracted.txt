Sometimes I want to reconnect, but when it’s been weeks/months, I freeze. I overthink it and do nothing, and then it gets worse.



• What’s the smallest message you’ve sent that helped restart contact?

• Do you prefer people acknowledge the gap, or just say hi normally?

• What would make it easier for someone to stay in your life?

(If you’re not comfortable commenting, that’s totally okay.)
