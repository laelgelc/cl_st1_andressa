I’m in my final 3rd year of a math–computer science degree, and from day one I told myself I would make it. I’d succeed no matter what it took. And for two years straight, I did. I became the top of my class, the top of my major, even one of the top students in the country. But all the prizes, the applause, the “you’re brilliant” and “you have potential” they landed in an empty room inside me. They echoed, but they never filled anything.
I walked the extra mile every single day. Woke up at 5 a.m., reached university before the staff, sometimes even argued with the security guard because I got there too early. I spent weekends buried in books studying subjects nobody else even tried to understand. Slowly, steadily, I climbed to the top.
And that’s when I started noticing… the shift.
People respected me more. Colleagues suddenly became friendly. My inbox exploded during exam season. Everyone wanted something, to explain that or help with that, everyone was kind, everyone was “close.” But once the grades were out, everyone vanished. No calls. No texts. Messages left on “seen.” It hit me the hardest with someone I had a crush on I thought she liked me. Turns out she liked my lecture notes more. And the cycle repeated every semester: warmth during exams, silence right after.
I kept seeing the same pattern until it became painful to deny:
No real friends.
No real love.
Just people needing me for what I could give them, then dropping me the second they were done.
And sometimes I still trick myself with hope. Then I remember exactly how it ended before, and how it will probably end again.

All this success, all these achievements, all this discipline came at a cost. I lost weekends. I lost relationships. I lost friends. I lost parts of myself my peace, my mind, a chance to just be young and happy. And honestly?
I’d trade it all.
For one real friend.
For one real laugh.
For a minute of warmth, for a second of real love.
Because what’s the point of success if, at the end of the day, there’s no one left to share it with… not even yourself.
