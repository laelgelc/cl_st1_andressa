So lately I’ve been having these routinely repetitive days. The problem is no thoughts come across my mind, I don’t feel compelled to do anything, it’s like my energy is being entirely sucked out from my body. When I do something to feel alive, it feels nothing at all to me. Is anyone out there feeling the same way?
