Human interaction makes my mental health worse so I shouldn't do it but I've been feeling lonely, physically, like there's a hormone deficiency, for almost five years.

I waste too much time trying to find friends and I fear that if I don't isolate myself I'll end up in prison.

Any tips for someone wanting to try friendship celibacy?
