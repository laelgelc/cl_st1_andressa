I try to hold on to acquaintances and get their phone number and try to build something, but it never happens. Just a few exchanges and then they ghost. Same with "friends" I make from situations (like work etc). I get their info and they barely respond back then ghost. Just totally stop responding or it's so dead and obvious they don't want to talk, I just let it go. All they'd have to do is send ONE question or prompt to keep the conversation going but they simply don't want to.
If it's "way cooler guy" they're non stop chatter mouth. Follow THAT person around begging to be acknowledged. I hate people.

And this isn't just a "kid" thing or a "school" thing, it's an everywhere thing. I'm 47 years old. It still happens and happens to others as well. I'm so tired of literally nobody caring. I have like 2 contacts in my phone. My son and my ex wife.
