This feels really vulnerable to post, but here goes.

Somewhere along the way, my kid and my career kind of took over my entire life. I don’t regret either of them—I love my kid more than anything, and I work hard—but I don’t really leave my house much anymore. I don’t interact with people often. Most days, it’s just responsibilities, routines, and getting through what needs to be done.

And I’m lonely.

Not in a dramatic way. Just in the quiet, everyday way that sneaks up on you. I really miss the little things—someone asking how my day was and actually meaning it. Someone texting “good morning” or “How was work today.” Just feeling like I matter to someone outside of what I *do* for everyone else.

I’m not looking for flirting or anything intense. I just want genuine conversation. A real connection. Someone to talk to about life, random thoughts, the good stuff, the hard stuff... I miss being seen as a person, not just a role.

If you’re feeling similar and want to talk, I’d really like that. No pressure. Just honesty and kindness.

Thanks for reading.
