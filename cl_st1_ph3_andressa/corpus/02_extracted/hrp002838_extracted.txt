It's now two weeks that this subreddit is up and running. Several people have expressed their frustration that this subreddit (and the [discord server that goes with it](https://discord.gg/3tdH33P)) are not more dynamic. 

One one hand: I am convinced that this is a question of time: The more we are the more dynamic this subreddit will become. And with time the number of followers will grow for sure. 

Beyond that: What can we do to make it more dynamic (or get more people involved)? I'm a bit hesitant to advertise it again on other subreddits. Any ideas or suggestions?
