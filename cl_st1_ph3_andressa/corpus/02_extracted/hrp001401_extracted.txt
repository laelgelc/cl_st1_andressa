Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling with feelings of loneliness lately. I find it hard to open up to family or friends about what I’m going through. I want to find ways to overcome this loneliness, build genuine connections, and improve my mental well-being.

Are there strategies, routines, communities, or habits that have helped you cope with male loneliness? I’d appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or resources that could help me feel less isolated.

Thank you in advance!
