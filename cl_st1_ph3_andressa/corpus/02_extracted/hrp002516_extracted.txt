Today's my birthday, it's pretty depressing, but I used to always get excited for my birthdays when I was a child, but now it's just another reminder that I have no one.

There's nothing good about my birthday; I just feel sad, no one remembers my birthday, not my parents, siblings, or acquaintances. All I get for my birthday is a heavy feeling in my chest and crying myself to sleep.

I didn't think I'd still be around for my 23rd birthday, but I'm still here, so that's good, I suppose. It feels like I'm expecting something to happen to me on my birthday, but all that happens is disappointment and suicidal thoughts. 

Welp, I suppose my only goal for the rest of the year is to stay alive and find something to distract myself with.

I'm so alone, fuck my life.
