i’m currently in university feeling like I am surrounded by people but have never felt more alone. I am not great friends with my roomate’s we just kind of exist with each other, I have friends that never ask me to hang out and always say no or reject my offers to hang out. I have a boyfriend at the same university that I love dearly but I feel as though the only people I spend time with are him,  his friends/roomate’s and I don’t have my own friends cause they don’t want to hang out with me. I know everyone is busy with school work, I am also but at the same but find myself feeling so alone when everyone is having fun and hanging out. I don’t really have many close friends at school and I don’t know how to handle this feeling of crippling loneliness. i’ve been trying to get myself back into my old art hobbies to help but I just feel so sad
