Whatever you say, siblings are a imp part of life, One lives a very boring and sad life without them. I am not in depression or ever want to s\*\*\*\*ide. But I think that I need someone that I can confide with. IDK why but my mental energy is down a bit since I moved to a new city after living in one for 10 years. I dont have a good friend, who I can confide with. I wish that God helps me in this.
