Everytime I try to make friends they never last for long or they always end up betraying me. I can never have deep conversations or talks with anyone it’s like no one cares about my emotions of feelings. I’ve noticed myself slowly softening up to the thought of not being on earth anymore. I don’t know what to do ?
