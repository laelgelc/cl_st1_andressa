I haven’t felt this level of loneliness in a while or even ever.  I’m scared.  Once school starts back up I’ll be all alone.  I only work weekends right now so I won’t be able to see my family as much.  Outside of the people that I live with, I have no one.  No friends, no gf, and it feels like my family is falling apart.  Just when I thought I was healing and doing better this feeling just hits me right in the gut.  I work, I doomscroll, I eat, and I sleep.  That’s it.  I have no one to hang out with in person and go do fun things with.  I only have like one friend online that I barely even talk to.  Idk I just don’t think I’ve ever felt this alone before.  It hurts.  I’m not gonna hurt anyone or myself of course but it just hurts.  I wanna laugh again, I want to have a life outside of my normal routine.  I want people I can be stupid with again.  I’m just so alone.
