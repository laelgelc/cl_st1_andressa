I used to have a “friend” who really genuinely needed me. It was not a healthy relationship at \*all\* and eventually I had to leave because every conversation would degrade into constantly being degraded, yelled at, or forced to apologize and then basically coddle him. To be honest, I don’t miss him, but I miss feeling useful, it feels like it ruined all my other relationships because I don’t feel needed like that anymore

edit: not taking this down in case this can be a warning to others, but I have 4 dms from people right now and one said “I love the need to be needed dynamic”. Fuck you. Stay safe out here y’all
