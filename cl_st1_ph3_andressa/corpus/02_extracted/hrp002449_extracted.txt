*my face gets irritated*

*so I learned to lean forward,*

*and kinda shut my eyes hard*

*and watch my tears fall from above.*

*it’s like watching the rain fall*

*except in the other direction.*

*and it keeps my eyes from*

*appearing more watery.*

*and with the right daylight,*

*you can watch them glisten*

*as the light passes through them*

*to make them appear like falling diamonds.*
