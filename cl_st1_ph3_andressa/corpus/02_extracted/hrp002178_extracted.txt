My first post here was taken down due to misinterpretation- but its okay. To say it clearer: I feel unloved, unwanted, Im *not* looking for a partner. I just feel incredibly lonely, I stare at my ceiling on my free time, im letting go of guitar, the only things i draw lately is vent art of how lonely I feel. I dont want to reach out to people I feel dont want my company, I always try my best to be considerate and polite, though I dont understand why I dont really have real friends, I havent had a best friend since middle school. I question myself why it is that people stray away from me, but i cant find an answer. Im trying my best always. When i meet someone they treat me really well, seek me out and are incredibly nice to me. And then they drop me after like a week. I hope this was comprehensive and suits the subreddit, i cant even write ive been crying since last night, really tired. So i hope it makes legible sense.
