I know several sociopaths and sometimes I envy them. They don't crave human connection, they're not hurt when somebody leaves, and when their friends are suffering they can have a clear level headed perspective instead of getting caught up in the emotions of it all. 

Sometimes I wish I could turn off my empathy. Turn off my need for friendships and relationships and connection. 

I wonder if it would make being alone easier.
