I am not one to talk too much on how to combat loneliness because I struggle with it myself but I find that volunteering helps. It gives you an opportunity to meet all types of people and make new friends or acquaintances. More than anything, you won't be alone. Plus, it feels great to give back to the community. Search up your nearest animal shelter, food pantry's (churches, I'm not a christian btw)  or hospitals. Give them a call or look online for volunteer application. I'm not from the state that I currently live in and I found that it really helped combat my loneliness a bit.
