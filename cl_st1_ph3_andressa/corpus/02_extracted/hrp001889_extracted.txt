I've always felt somewhat lonely since highschool. Never talked to my family, just stayed in my room all day. Had some acquaintances in highschool that I wasn't close with and one real friend. 

I moved to study abroad in sydney for university and it's horrible. I live alone, eat alone, study alone and it's so difficult for me to make friends in class. I really did try to turn my life around and finally have "friends", I joined so many events. But it's somehow even worse than highschool. At least back then I had one friend, who I can hug and hold hands with. Now, I have like no physical touch with any living being. I'm also so socially awkward that it's practically impossible to talk. I'm going to waste my youth feeling lonely. I've wasted my teenage years being alone and I'm now going to waste my 20s being alone too
