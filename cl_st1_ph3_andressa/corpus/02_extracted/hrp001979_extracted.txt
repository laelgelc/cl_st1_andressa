All these years, I finally feel some kind of emotion—loneliness.

I usually sit alone, eat alone, and go out alone, but this has always been normal for me because I’m used to it. It’s never been a problem since I’ve been doing this from high school to college.

I did have a group of friends before, but I often chose to sit alone because I like being by myself. Over time, my friends understood that I preferred being alone, so they slowly left me out. I’ve also never been in a relationship.

I just realized that my loneliness isn’t because I don’t have a boyfriend or friends—it’s because I don’t have someone to talk to.

Maybe it’s because I haven’t talked to another human being in a while.
