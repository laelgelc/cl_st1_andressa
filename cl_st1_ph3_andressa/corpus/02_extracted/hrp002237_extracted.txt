Hey. I know you are out there. I know you are going through stuff. Some expected, some unexpected. I know you are hurting. I know you feel lost. I know the pain rushes in at the most inopportune moments. I know you are reminding yourself throughout the day that everything thats happened is for the best. I know you miss the moments. I know you close your eyes and memories rush back. I know you have deep regrets and I know you have things you wish you could say. I know all this because I feel it too. Stay strong. Let the good memories overpower the bad. Hug yourself like you need to be hugged. ​Know that someone is out there loving you through all your hurt. Someone is sharing in all your joyful moments even though you cant see them. Love is blind. Love ignores boundaries. Love is the sunrise and the sunset. You are loved.
