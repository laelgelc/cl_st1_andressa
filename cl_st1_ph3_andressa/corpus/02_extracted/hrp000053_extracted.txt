So, as some of you are aware, this subreddit and r/LonelyButLoner were created at about the same time to accomplish the same purpose. I created this one, but quickly left when I was offered a position as a mod in the other one, which now leaves this one without any mods. Funnily enough, however, this is the one that grew larger, and continues to see a lot more activity than the other one.

Anyway, getting to the main topic, r/LonelyButLoner has a Discord server that is losing activity and could use a boost, even if its subreddit doesn't get it. Since these two subreddits accomplish more or less the same purpose, I was hoping some of you would be interested in joining our Discord server, which would both boost the server's activity, and also help bridge the two subreddits.

With all of that said, for anyone interested, here is the link: [https://discord.gg/GJhNHEw](https://discord.gg/GJhNHEw)
