I just want my daddy, I want to cry. I feel so so alone, I hate existing and dealing with this shit daily and the holidays are awful fucking reminders. I have to go visit extended family four hours away tomorrow for thanksgiving and I do NOT want to be around family. I do not want to socialize. I do not want to have a conversation. I know I'm just going to be there silently moping and miserable and trying to "subtly" exclude myself from my family until eventually my extended family wonder what’s wrong with me and my parents are embarrassed and disappointed by their miserable daughter. I do not want to go but I know if I told my parents they would be hurt and I'd have to go anyway, so I've just kept my mouth shut and do whatever they ask of me. I just want to lay here and cry. I want to be cuddled, and held, and told that everything is alright and know that I have someone to love and who loves me. I'm so desperately lonely, I don't want to wake up to a fucking holiday tomorrow. And then after that I'm going to spend more of the money I need to save to move out on holiday gifts and junk for myself. I need a job, I have no job, and I have no interest in a career, but I need to LEAVE. I don't want to live here!! I'm so unhappy!!! I need to leave and be alone and be elsewhere to be unhappy by myself. Everything sucks, I'm so hateful and yet I'm so fucking sad I just wanted a future worth living for with my ex but I don't have that, it's always just a facade I don't want to keep doing this
