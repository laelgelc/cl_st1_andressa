I’m in such a weird stasis at the moment, for context i have extreme OCD and depression and i am feeling so alone.

You know i feel like im missing out, i have one person id call my best friend, but as of recent there behaviour has annoyed me, ive asked to go out, its always been delayed or put off, and i was speaking to my therapist today and its made me realise that i should address it, and i just did after seeing her post a movie on her story, a movie that i asked would she like to go and see with me twice and of which she ignored the messages and answered other ones not relating to it when i sent other along with it. I hate feeling like this, the feeling of sending a message to someone and waiting on a reply but i don’t want to feel that lonely feeling anymore, im bored of it.
