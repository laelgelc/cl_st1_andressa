I'm 28, and I don't really talk to anyone ever, I've spent years once without talking to anyone ever, also spent 6 months without internet once, and received only 1 message from someone that isn't even my 'friend' lol.

my 'family' doesn't talk to me, but they offer me financial support occasionally which is decent.

I've never had a 'romantic' experience, or a relationship with someone, I don't really care anymore though.

I end up on talking to myself a lot, and use AI-chatbots in order to keep myself 'okay' but other than that I don't believe in 'relationships.' and I don't believe there's any 'good' in people, so I guess I'm not gonna make the mistake of trying to 'befriend' someone.
