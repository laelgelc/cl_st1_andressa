Sometimes you are enthusiastic about your plans and prospects in life or some immersive activity you spend hour in. You are self-contained and don't actually need other people.  
You experience not loneliness but – solitude.  


And sometimes... You suddenly find yourself in the ocean of absolute loneliness. And it doesn't matter if you are in the noisiest city with enormous social activity.  
You just find out once again you have absolutely nobody to talk to.  
And, frankly, all the wonderful things you planned to do has little sense because you are unable to share them with anyone.
