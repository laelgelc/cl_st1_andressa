We're going to an animal enclosure for biology class and I feel disheartened by the fact that I'm all alone. I don't know who to go in pairs with and I hate my teachers for wanting us to be in pairs when I don't want to. I would have much preferred staying home but here I am. And I've tried conversing with people but they all treat me like everything I say is a nuisance.
