I do like being alone, it gives me time to rest, clear my mind, feel more relaxed but I do want someone to be there for each other. Somebody I can talk about stuff without feeling like I'm forcing them to. Somebody that's chill and vibes with me. Not necessarily a bf but a soul mate that's there. Somebody that can get me. I don't even know how I'm gonna find a partner being in healthcare. I just really want to feel like I belong somewhere. My family lives in another state, my close friends(that I never truly trust) are going to another country and I'm entering a workplace in a few months time. I've always feel lost and lonely but I feel like it's amplifying for me. Chatting to people online doesn't seem to work either. My schedule makes it difficult to chat with people. I'm up at 4.30am for internship and back at 4pm, by the time I get back I'm tired af till I just sleep or complete my assignments and fall asleep. I just feel kinda lonely sometimes it sucks.
