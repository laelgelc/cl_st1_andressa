My mom died 12 years ago. I was with my now husband and have since had a child.

I have never felt more alone than I have in the past 12 years. Her being gone is one thing. But losing the people who you talked to 10x a day, who listened to you the right way when you were sad, helped you always, gave you advice and just was always there for everything. It’s so debilitating.

I find myself over the last 12 years crying often wishing I was “home” and It makes me so sad to feel alone and uncomfortable in my life in all aspects. 

I wish I had someone.
