I hate it where I live. I live in a small valley community where pretty much the only way to meet people my age is at the bar    or through religious gatherings. there is also no reliable public transport between the 5 or so towns that are like 5-10minutes away from each other. its horrible for someone that is a extrovert and is stuck at home do to lack of transportation and only can try and make friends online that end up ghosting me. I know other people have it worse but it still is hard especially to find some one to either hang out with or a nice gal to go on a date with. I appreciate any and all comments.
