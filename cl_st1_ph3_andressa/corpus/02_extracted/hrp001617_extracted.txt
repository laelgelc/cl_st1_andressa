Heyy im a 17 F, its my first time writing on here. I've been really desperate on finding someone to talk to. I've made illogical choices bc of that, it clogged my mind. I even disrespected my bf and i feel bad. 
Ive been writing conversations between me and myself, it's helpful for introspection and self kindness but at some point it's just miserably lonely. I know im still young and all, i may exaggerate and act like a kid but i hope it's not too much trouble. So, how do you guys deal with loneliness?
