I've spent over a decade in an internet chatroom. The community is pretty small and everyone knows each other. We've got a lot of history as we grew up together. I feel very lonely most days, but that community gives me somewhere to talk.

I reckon I wouldn't have found myself in a community like that if I wasn't for feeling so lonely irl. Has anyone else been an active member of a chatroom / internet community for this long?
