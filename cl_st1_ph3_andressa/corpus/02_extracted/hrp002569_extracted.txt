For me, it's the peace and quiet that comes with it, getting things like work done faster without having to worry about anyone else, not having to deal with stupid social bullshit or drama from anyone, focusing on my personal growth and mental health as a person, as well as the fact that I can basically do whatever the hell I want without anyone's input.
