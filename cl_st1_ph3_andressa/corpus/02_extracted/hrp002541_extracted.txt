So yeah, I have decided to stay lonely, even if it isn't actually my choice and it was going to be this way anyway. 

I tried making friends online and it only worked once. I tried making friends in real life and people in my area are just not people I want to associate with, so I just keep my two same friends since preschool. I tried dating online and couldn't get attention to save my life. I tried meeting people at bars and I just don't seem to click with them. I tried just about everything and nothing worked, so I just decided to not try at all.

I made the choice to stay alone even if I didn't have a choice to begin with, maybe that way it won't feel so shitty. I just don't want to make it anybody's problem, they are not the ones that made me lonely, it just happened. 

Any tips on being happy with loneliness?
