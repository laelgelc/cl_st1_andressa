I have no friends, have never had any relationships, gosh, I've been feeling so lonely for a long time, I have no social life, and the thing is, all of this, has been eating away at me, I used to before, just tell myself I like being alone, and that used to be enough, as in I minded the loneliness, and viewed as solitude, but now it's not enough, there have been a lot of nights where I'll cry myself to sleep, and before u say, u are in the school, as in school is the easiest way to make friends, it's really hard, also, my parents have been moving a lot lately, and as soon as I start to feel like I'm making a relationship with people, we move, and I have to start once again, also in that regard, everybody already has their friend group, and rarely are looking to make friends, so It makes it harder, and not just that, but like nobody really liked or likes me, not ever, I've always felt invisible, like there is nothing fun and interesting about me, and so, no one really approaches me, and I don't either, everybody calls me weird, for being who I am, like always, also a lot of times, they be laughing behind my back
Anyways it just really hurts, and I can't deal with this anymore.
