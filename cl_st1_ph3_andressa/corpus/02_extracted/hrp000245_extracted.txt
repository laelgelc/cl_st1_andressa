I want to vent a little.
Every friend of mine either is in a relationship, has experienced casual sex. I have never kissed someone and they keep telling me that it is easier than it looks. Really? I feel like they lie to me so that I feel less sad. 
I feel like I am unloveable because of my carton personality, my ugly looks and because I am fat.
When will it end?
