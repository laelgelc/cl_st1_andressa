I’m doing so badly in school that I’m almost at the point of being forced to drop out. I was so excited to study something I’m interested in, but now I don’t even know if I can continue.

People I used to stick with in school have grown closer, and I’ve been left out. They walked out of class to lunch without me. I ran after them, and I felt so stupid, and I regretted it immediately. I feel really lonely, struggling with school, and I don’t have any friends to talk to about any of this.

All I wanted was one friend who could stick with me throughout my school life. I’ve been crying a lot lately. With tests these past few weeks, I’ve tried, failed, and cried. I feel like dropping out before I’m forced to, but if I do, I’d be just as lost as I am now.
