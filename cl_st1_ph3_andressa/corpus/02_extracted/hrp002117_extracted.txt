(26f) I'm gonna hit 27 this year and it's kinda awful to see everyone around me getting married, having kids or just have a nice social life. I'm lonely since I remember, I don't have a best friend, maybe only two people with who I talk spontaneously. Yeah maybe I'm an introvert and feel content being alone, but I'd like to have at least one person in my life. It doesn't have to be anyone to share a romantic interest with, just a friend. I feel envious of other people my age because they have something I never had. I feel like a loser because I've never been approached in any case, and when I finally manage to meet someone, they dump me for some other "friends". So yeah, I feel awful and miserable, lol. 

I just wanted to vent, thanks for reading tho.
