Im just such a loser, can't make friends. Can't talk to women or keep a conversation going with them and when one talks to me I start immediately overthinking and asking myself why they even started talking to me in the first place. Do they like me or were they curious about the 22 year old that looks like he's 29 and nothing more. But tiny voice in the back of my head keeps telling me ill find the one which is just bullshit. I dont do anything all day except go to college, work, and go home and play videogames. I barely get out unless there's a movie I want to see or if its 20 degrees out and the park is empty. I always keep thinking maybe today is the day I find someone. No no no, TODAY is the day not yesterday. Hell, the friends I have in person i barely see because they either are moving away, focusing on their careers or they themselves are in a relationship. My friends online don't even consider me a real friend despite me knowing them for 4 years and visited all of them once on every one of those 4 years. It's always the asshole that gets picked over me. Why the hell is it so hard to find friends who'll want to stuck around and actually give a shit about you? I just want to stop feeling this way. I wish there was a switch I can turn off to get rid of this because I dont care what people say. Feeling nothing is better than being alone and miserable every single day.
