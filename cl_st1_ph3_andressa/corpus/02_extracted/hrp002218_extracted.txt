I'll preface by saying I have a boyfriend and siblings. But other than that, it's just brief interactions with friends of theirs or work acquaintances.

I don't have people to randomly ask to hang out, I have no one inviting me to a concert or movie or whatever. I end up with too much time to myself to feel empty and alone, to see posts of people with their close friends having a great time. I've been told I'm a good person and that I'm funny, so what am I doing wrong? Is this just what to expect from here on out?
