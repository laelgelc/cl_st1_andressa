He doesn’t like me and he is not attracted to me. He sends me photos of his dates. 

I feel it’s pretty toxic. He won’t see me but likes to keep me around for attention. He is busy dating other people but he doesn’t think it will work out. 

I feel who he is.. is pretty unlikeable. His stomach was partially removed and he has other organ issues. His nails are purple. Not a healthy guy mentally and physically.

I keep wanting him for some reason. But my body says no. It’s my stupid heart. I am attached but I don’t want him long term, he is too mean. I just want to see him once and that’s it.
