Hello, I'm a 29 year old female looking for other female friends to chat with. I'm pretty lonely and would love to be your female friend if you'll have me. Let's get to know each other! 

I have experince dealing with mental illness like anxiety, depression and ptsd. If you also struggle with mental illness you could vent to me. I know how difficult it can be. I'm still on my healing journey. 

I enjoy music a lot. It's a form a tharapy for me. I love anything if I think it sounds good. Any genre really. I gravitate towards rock, metal, rap and pop as it dominates my playlists.

Other hobbies I enjoy are outdoor activities and excersize. Hiking, going to the river, pumpkin patches and going to the gym. 

I also enjoy art and interior decorating. I love creating art and decorating my home with it. 

Please let me know if you, a fellow female would like to chat and be friends! 😊
