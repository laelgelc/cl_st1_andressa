i do have friends but i think they hate me… i do have a family but i think they hate me… i overthink 
everything… it kills me inside, i rethink abt every conversation i have with ppl and regret every word and start thinking they hate me now. im tired i feel lonely and im sensitive, i think abt every word that ppl say to me… i think from other’s perspective abt me, i hate my life because it never stops. im an introvert i cant talk to randoms without feeling anxious. i always need a friend to assure me they dont hate me which actually makes them hate me. i feel lonely everyday because i always want ppl around me or talking to me because if it doesn’t happen my brain starts thinking they hate me.
