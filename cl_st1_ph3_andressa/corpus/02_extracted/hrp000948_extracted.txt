I'm an empty vessel. A body without a soul or if there is one in there it is crippled and decayed.  Or perhaps decaying. Broken and alone in a room full of people. I know people have said that so many times in life. When I'm alone it isn't quiet. The walls echo my thoughts. My brain is the walls rough desperately sad thoughts. Hopeless. I have no where to run anymore. I can't remember what I saw last in the mirror. Put on a happy face, walk about, but never run. There is no where left to hide. I am weary.
