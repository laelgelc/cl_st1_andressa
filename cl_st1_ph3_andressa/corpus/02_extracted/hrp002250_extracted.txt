Aside from my mother, in all relationships I have ever had, it has always been like this. From romantic relationships to friendships to family relationships, I feel like no one has truly cared about me, like actually cared, beyond surface level feelings. I'm too sensitive. I have a big heart, and I feel things too deeply. I have so much love to give, but it was probably worthless to most people. 

What triggered me right now was my boyfriend. I'm starting to realize that he's only with me because he hates being alone. I'm just a convenience. He always chooses his family, friends, and video games over me. Whenever he's alone, he knows that I will always be there, so he comes to me. For the past few days, he's been ignoring me, and when I do have a conversation with him, he doesn't even pay attention. 

This has opened my eyes to reflect on my current friendships and acquaintances, and hell, even just random people I come into contact with. I've stopped everything I was doing just so I can fully support them. I've stayed up all night on the phone comforting them, and I've talked things through with them despite going through my own mental struggles and having no energy. I didn't mind doing it because I knew they needed someone to talk to, and I deeply cared for them and wanted them to be safe. But at the times I needed someone, there was no one. Everyone was 'busy' despite them saying theyd do the same for me.

I just want someone to care.
