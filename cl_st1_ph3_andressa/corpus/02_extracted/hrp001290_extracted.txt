Hi, is my brithdqy today. And i dont think anyone actually remember it, not even my family. Mom still sending my reels, no one else saying anything - not even my close friends. 
I got like 4 happy birthday, from my ex, ex’s mom, my one friend who lives miles away and one kid at my work. 
I dont know what to feel. Im sorry not sure what else to say. Probably just hope for something better than this since i just have a shitty year…
