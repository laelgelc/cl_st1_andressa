I'm looking for someone who truly sees themselves in Dominique “Dom” DiPierro. I'm not talking about "I like the character" or "I identify with it a little bit." It has to be someone who knows who she really is, who knows her way of thinking, her wounds, her way of holding on when everything weighs heavily. Someone who feels like Dom could be a reflection of himself.
A woman who can feel alone even when surrounded, but who does not settle for empty connections. Value direct honesty, even if it hurts, because lies don't fit into your world. If you are firm on the outside, with an internal crack that does not destroy you but keeps you real, then you will understand this without me having to explain it further.
The country doesn't matter. It only matters that we speak clearly, without filters. I'm looking for an authentic friendship, with someone who lives that same way of being in the world.
The rest, don't waste your time. This is for those who truly feel it.
