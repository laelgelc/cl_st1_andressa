I’m listening to heroes by David Bowie and wishing I could dance to it with someone. I think I’m making ok with feeling lonely, and now all of the wishes of togetherness I have kind of just feel warm instead of a reminder that they’re not real? My imagination is sort of the best thing I have right now to all this stuff, and when I’m super busy thinking it’s easier to realize I forgot what hugging and stuff like that feels like.
