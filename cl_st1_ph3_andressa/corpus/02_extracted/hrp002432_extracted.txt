I never picked up on this until my therapist  told me. He told me you have no confirmation of your existence so you play things in your head that you must be unlovable or ugly but nobody is actually saying so except you. 

I guess I'm  really that person that you really have no clue what theyre  really going through even though it doesnt feel like it. I guess it makes me feel a little better but it still bothers me that I might look normal on the outside because I don't inside.
