My bf and I have been long distance for 3 years as we're both in college, luckily just a few towns over so we can see each other on the weekends though. I have a horrible roommate situation and can't really keep in-person contact with my friends, for obvious reasons, and will be starting a hiatus from work tomorrow due to poor mental health and school. With all of this combined I feel like I'm leaning on my bf far too much and worry that I'm smothering him. He has a slightly better roommate situation and is a far more solitary person than I am, so he's fine with the limited in-person contact that he has now. I just feel like I've fallen overboard and he's the rope that was thrown to me, but I'm worried that if I pull too hard it'll break.
