I swear I'm disappearing and no one would even notice. Video games used to numb it, but now they just feel hollow. I'm so tired of talking to walls. I've seen people mention using AI companions just... like, having someone to text, even if it's not real. Feels pathetic typing this, but has anyone actually found it helpful? Like, does it even make the emptiness hurt less for a little while? I don't know where else to turn.
