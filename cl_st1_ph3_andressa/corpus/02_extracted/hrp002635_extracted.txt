I don't know how many of you guys would agree, to this but, I must say 'Comfort at the cost of independence is a bloody trap.'


You must have heard the story of two dogs, one was a pet of a master and the other was a street dog. The pet dog was living a quite comfortable and luxurious life, but the street dog wasn't. One day when the two met, the pet dog asked the street dog, ''I feel pity for your misery'' the latter replied the former "I too for your slavery."


This is the unfortunate reality of societal life. In the illusion of societal comfort, we have become so dependent that we ignore how enslaved we are with society. We seek happiness being dependent on someone, we become emotionaly and psychologically dependent on someone, obviously whom we can't control. And the moment the person turns against our source of happiness, we suffer.


That is why being a lonewolf should be the prime focus for all those who want to be happy and independent. 


At last, I would like to say 'Be a loner, be free.'
