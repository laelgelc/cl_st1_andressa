I am not ok, alone, no one to talk and really need someone to talk, some things happened and I just need reassurance and validation that what I’ve been feeling and facing are understandable and everything will be alright, but I don’t have anyone. 

If I talk with some people around me like acquiantance or “friends” (not close), they won’t relate and not validating my feelings and just talk about another topics and i really feel no one cares and no one to “lean on”. 

If someone on my position right now I would listen to her and try to help, at least giving reassurance and try to positioning myself on herself and understand the emotion, fear and convincing her that she is not alone and I would help as much as I could. But i don’t have that kind of person that would do the same, it’s so stressful to cry everyday for hours try to calm myself, if at least one empathetic human being there and spend 15-20minutes to help me “untangle” my messy thoughts/overthinking it would help me a lot. 

Is there anyone who used to feel the same? How do you go through it? I walked around the city alone, jogging, for god’s sake it’s not helping i really need one livable human and i don’t enjoy my own company, it’s so depressing, even for studying or doing some things i prefer in library/cafe so i don’t feel alone even i’m not talking to anyone. 

I feel like I need someone to catch up, social interaction but I don’t want to make other people uncomfortable or feeling disturbed because of my needs, especially i’m kind of in crisis situation
