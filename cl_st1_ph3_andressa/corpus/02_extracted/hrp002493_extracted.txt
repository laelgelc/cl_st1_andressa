Not counting work calls where I just say yes and take notes. I mean an actual conversation where someone asks how I'm doing and waits for a real answer.

My family group chat is just memes. My coworkers are nice but we only talk about projects. I scroll through instagram seeing everyone else at dinners and parties and I can't even remember the last time someone invited me to something.

The really pathetic part is I've gotten so used to being alone that when my neighbor tried to chat with me in the hallway yesterday I basically ran away because I got anxious. Just said yeah cool and walked into my apartment like a weirdo🙃.

I don't even know how I got here. Used to have friends and do stuff. Then the pandemic happened and everything moved online and I just never figured out how to rebuild it I guess. Now I'm stuck in this loop where I'm lonely but too anxious to reach out to anyone.

Sorry for the depressing post. Just needed to write this somewhere cause keeping it in my head was making it worse.
