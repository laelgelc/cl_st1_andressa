As I read in the book "The art of Gathering", meetups should have rather ambition and a bit unconventional goals. So here we go:

* Finalise complete restructuring of our organisation (outcome of discussion from last Saturday)
* Logo: Each one of us has to make three quick drawings and share them with the rest of us
* Website: Find at least one website you think has the features we need and a design you like.
* Documentation re meetups: What are three key insights from your own activity that you think every meetup organiser should know. 

How does this sound?
