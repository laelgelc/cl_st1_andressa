I can't open up because I'm afraid of rejection. because I'm afraid of rejection, I remain emotionally distant and don't let relationships develop. because I don't let relationships develop, they end. because they end, I feel rejected and it reinforces the loop. I've given up really. I don't get to have friends. does anyone else relate?
