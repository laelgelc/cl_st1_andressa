really confused with my life right now, I have no close friends and no people I can just go and talk to about anything. All my life I had friends who I would spend most of my time with and talk about any and everything but after the lockdown I just lost all of them. I always got along with people in high school and took part in the conversations and stuff but no one ever approached and talked to me after classes. Ive never felt that someone else wants me just bad as I want them, not even in a romantic way just as friends. I thought that when college started I would make new friends and try to do all the things I missed out on during high school. The first half of the year went really well, I made new friends and we had a lot of fun together and I really felt that I was part of something and that I was valued. But then I got into a conflict with a guy from our group, I dont even know how or why, but It was such a small thing but the entire group just stopped talking to me and inviting. Honestly the part I am struggling over is why me? The other people have done things which are even more messed up than me. imo the thing I did was not even that big, They guy i got into a fight with (lets call him A) has done really creepy and messed up things, and everyone from the group knows but still I was left out .Now that I have stopped hanging out with them Ive realised even during that half year no one ever came to me first. I dont know if im haning onto this and came at the situation in the wrong was and tried to do damage control because of my insecurities of being alone. Im so confused and angry and I just dont know what to do. I really dont have a reason a wrote this other than just to get this off my chest.
