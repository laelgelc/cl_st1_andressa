Hi,
I don’t really know how this works. I made the title it said add tags maybe I shouldn’t have. Please forgive me if this is ridiculous. 
I am a 47 year old female. I have been divorced for 11 years now. I was married for 15 years and we share three sons who are now all grown up. The thing is I recently realized that he may have been the love of my life and that I will never have that again. We don’t ever see each other and rarely speak unless it’s something about our sons. 3 weeks ago I texted him about something and our conversation was so typical
Of what it used to be when we where together. When I hung up, I immediately started to cry because I miss my best friend. I have never been the same I never will be, I know that but I honestly didn’t think that o would still be alone. When he left me, for another woman, I really thought I would find someone else and that I would be married by now. But the truth is that may not happen. I feel so scared and alone. My friends are all married with kids of their own, I have no one to talk to.
