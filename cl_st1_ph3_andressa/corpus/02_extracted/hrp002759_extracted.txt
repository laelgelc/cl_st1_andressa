I feel like I'm in a pretty interesting situation of being a loner. Please tell me if anyone has been through anything similar. When I was an infant my father abandon me, taking my brother with him and never contacting me or my mom again. As I grew up my mother slowly drift away from me and left me at my grandmother's house, though I was never officially abandoned by either of them by law. In school I could never make any friends. Even though some people said I was pretty, I was always socially inept and I never knew how to talk to people. 

Now I'm in college I've moved in with my mother since my grandmother went to go live with my aunt even though I begged her not to. My social skills haven't gotten any better. I don't like my mom, but she spends most of the time at work or with friends so I barley see her anyway. I can't get a job since our house is out in the middle of no ware and I can't drive. When I was a kid my grandmother was to old to teach me and my mom didn't want to. I've never had a boyfriend, friends, or anything like that. Probably never will, people always say I'm not there "type" whatever that means. I guess I do still kind of look like a 12 year old in any case I hate college and I hate living in my mom's house so I'm thinking of joining the military as a way of escape (either that or offing myself). Anyway has anyone grown- up in this kind of solitary way? Not out of choice but it was pretty much the only option.
