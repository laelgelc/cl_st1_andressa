had a very public and humiliating (for me) fallout with a group of popular girls in my batch of 200 students. they have been going around telling people to “beware” of me ever since. I’ve tried to talk to people and make connections but no one seems to want to be friends with me. im very far away from home and it’s really lonely here. making new friends is out of option since everyone already has pre formed groups that don’t allow newbies in. im so frustrated what did i ever do to deserve this?
