Hey everyone,

I’m working with a small team on an evidence-based app designed to help people build deeper friendships and overcome loneliness.

Right now, we’re looking for people willing to try a short module of our app and share their honest feedback. The session takes around 10–15 minutes, all online and easy to do from wherever you are by filling a form.

While we can’t offer payment, everyone who participates will be entered into a raffle for a $20 Amazon gift card as a thank you.

If you’re interested, just DM me for instructions. Just bring yourself and your honest thoughts. Everything you share is confidential.

Your input will help us build a tool that could make a real difference for people feeling isolated.

Thanks for reading.
