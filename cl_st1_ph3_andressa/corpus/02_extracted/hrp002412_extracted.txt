I know in some cities, there's a rent a friend service that is 100% platonic, and i think it's geared towards tourists because it's kinda like a tour guide too. 

i don't have any local friends because i've moved a lot and my online friends and i have grown a little apart. This happens a lot over the years which i acknowledge is normal but i'm so tired of working hard constantly for just basic human connection. 

sometimes the idea of paying for it makes me feel it might cheapen it but i think it may be a unique way to get platonic connection. i dunno, i go back and forth and wanted to see what other people thought about it. 

i'm not in any financial position to do it right now, but maybe in the future
