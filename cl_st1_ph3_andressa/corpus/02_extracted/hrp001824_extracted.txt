Idk tbh, ever since I was 12 or maybe even when I was younger, I felt very excluded from social cues n stuff like that and even up til now I'm still very socially awkward but at the same time I just kinda grew more into getting used to being lonely so. But then I also thought there was something wrong with me since people would give me weird looks and stuff whenever  I would be nice to them and it made me start to think I was ugly inside and out, and then that mindset grew and just kinda stood with me as a kid and even up til now. I never had anyone to open up my feelings to about too because I was always scared of getting judged or my feelings would be used against me. And also not having friends contributed to how felt too but like I said from before even whenever I would try to people it just didn't seem right, I got used to being alone aside from my mental health being horrid.
