I can’t maintain a friendship, every time I get close to someone I intentionally distant myself, I don’t want to create any emotional connections to anyone, I’m comfortable with myself. I don’t feel the need to expose myself to others, letting them tracing a gun in my head, and giving them the choice whether to press the trigger or not.
