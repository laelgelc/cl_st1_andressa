It’s an interesting paradox that the crux of many social media posts and memes has to do with loneliness; after all, this digital revolution was sold as being the panacea that would cure our alienation and bind us together in a great brotherhood. Yet here we are, nearly twenty years after the advent of said life-saving engines, alienated and isolated as ever: All those sad seekers of human connection, ever more pushed out to sea and remote on their islands, ever more hunkered down in their exclusive tribes and cliques. It gives me calm to know that technology really doesn’t help with the really basic human foibles, after all; it merely provides a cloak, a specious claim to helping. Now that we’ve been disabused of social media’s bogus paternal claims, maybe now we get set down to the real business of why we’re lonely, detached and disenfranchised. Perhaps the answer lies in a deeper and infinitely more evasive region at the seat of the Universal Psyche.
