Pretty much been waking up earlier than usual lately. I wake up feeling sad and unmotivated about the day. I've been lying in bed feeling sad for myself and lonely since I have no one to spend my day with, just like all my days off. Most social interaction is at a group exercise pilates class, gym, or grocery store. Sometimes I go to coffee shops but still feel alone and invisible. 

No wonder I'm sad and don't want to get out of bed, lonely all day basically. Even a cup of coffee or food doesn't sound appealing enough right now.

I have things to get done but am too sad to start my lonely day. I need to muster up the strength.
