M21 hikikomori/neet incel low IQ ugly half indian openly hated loser with 2/3 of my life a mindfuck regret.

I wish I had succeeded in something, any subject, endeavour. 

I'm starving myself and I feel dumber with the lack of nutrition. Initially scared my brain will melt to cultivate water for my other organs but fuck this penile shit world. 

Idk I just wish I was smart enough, handsome enough, a woman or a marginalized figure worthy of worship and admiration.

My family openly detests me and my younger sister is turning 16 this year. 

I can't live with myself knowing she's the better sibling and way smarter than me..I watched cartoons with her when she was a toddler. Why does she get to be liked and pampered?! I wish these people who hate me would openly mock me or ridicule me but they just ignore me but I would also hate that??

Idk I wish I could die a slow painful death so I feel some accomplishment. I hate this empty canvas of half-baked personal li
developments. I wish I could have been the Judas to betray the savior of the life loving masochists. I wish people would call me "Sir!" or ironically "Uncle". 

Having no one sucks. That's what my nephew told me recently "You have no one left. Behave yourself". Who does he think he is? But when he complains about his life my relatives give a fuck?!

I fucking hate this life, realm of consciousness. My death will be my biggest win! I want to die feeling my organs eating in on itself! My brain turn into goo! 

I just hope someone goes to my funeral. I want them to stand quiet around my grave. Fuck
