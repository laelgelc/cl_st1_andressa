I was busy with work and focused on my career, and I had all friends around whenever I had free time. Everything felt normal.

But after an injury put me on bed rest, things changed. Calls stopped, messages disappeared, and people I thought were close slowly faded away.

I’m not angry, just hurt and confused. Do friends only stay when life is fun and moving?
