I don’t usually share personal stuff online, but lately the loneliness has been hitting really hard.

I’m 6’1”, 51 kg, from India, a Computer Science student who spends most of my time coding, gaming, or watching anime/series. On the outside, my life looks fine—I keep myself busy with studies and hobbies—but inside, it feels empty without someone to talk to on a deeper level.

I’ll be honest: I’m shy, especially around girls, and that makes it tough to even think about dating. Most of the time I just bottle things up, and it’s starting to feel heavier day by day.

I love music (Pop, Rock, Rap), anime (One Punch Man, Death Note, JJK, AOT, Black Clover, Bleach), series like Lucifer, Peacemaker, Breaking Bad, and movies (action, comedy, horror). I guess what I’m looking for is just… connection. Someone to talk to, share random thoughts with, or even just laugh over dumb memes.
