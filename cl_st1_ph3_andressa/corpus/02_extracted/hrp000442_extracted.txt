This New Year’s Eve has been really rough leading up to it, and now’s finally the day I’ve been dreading. I have BPD, depression, and anxiety, and through high school I was in and out of school; slowly all the “friends” I made disappeared and left me behind. So I don’t have really any friends, two including my long-distance boyfriend. He provides me a lot of comfort, but he’s traveling and busy with friends, so it’s been pretty quiet, and it sets me into panic. I really tried to make plans with my friend to distract from this sadness and let go, but she would rather be going out with her other friends. I can’t remember the last time I felt carefree and was just having a blast and forgetting my problems for one day. I feel so selfish for getting upset at those around me; I hate to come across as “woe is me” and “I have it so horrible” when I know there are bigger problems out there. It just feels so heavy on my heart; :( I feel like a loser. I'm 19 (20 in May), and growing up, I had such a picturesque imagination of how becoming a teenager would be… going out with friends, partying, laughing, living life to the fullest and I just feel so robbed of this experience I wanted so badly. I know I'm catastrophizing this whole situation, but I just wish I was somebody else for this day; it hurts too much to be in my skin. I know lots of people spend their New Year's alone, and IM trying to be okay with it but im spiraling bad. Sorry for any confusion in my rant , thank you for listening <3
