i don't expect that much from everybody else. i don't know if it's my diagnosed autism, or my uninteresting traits. but i'm hurt.

they always paid affectionate attention and care towards most except me, in the harshest of days in which i didn't know if i'd stay alive next day. i'm always their exception. and i'm not saying this by overthinking it; this is the result of careful evaluation and help from professionals. they make me feel undesired, I AM undesired. and i'd rather them admitting it than pretending that's not, because their actions for years express something else entirely. i was always there for them if they needed, and i didn't expect to be their priority, just **someone**. but they stopped making me feel like human, like an individual.

even if it's not my fault, i'm carrying this pain with me all day. i want to meet people like me, and learn how to be around other people when years of mistreat broke me to pieces. i want to be able to lift others in my arms, but i'm too weak. i know i should have self-worth, but i don't feel like i even deserve that now.

i don't want to play victim. i don't want to be popular. i just want to feel human.
