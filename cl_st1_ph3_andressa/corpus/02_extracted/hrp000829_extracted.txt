Hey,

I just feel so lonely. I’ve talked with my therapist about how Im struggling with not knowing when I’m being overly friendly and pouring all of me and my story on friends for support and validation, and when I actually want to build a friendship or build a best friendship for that matter. I have so many friends but I don’t really have close friends anymore. The close friends I have that check up on me every other day or weekly have their own close friend groups that I feel like they resort to in the end for holidays or special events.

Example: 

I’ve been trying to plan to go to Renaissance festival but I don’t have anyone to go with. The ones I was planning with I didn’t finish cuz life got busy, and they didn’t follow up with me. None of my friends reached out to plan a ren fest with me but I hear how they went with others. Now they are sold out so I couldn’t even go by myself if I wanted to. I’m a fantasy lover and I’ve always wanted to embrace that more, outside of sitting at home and watching lotr or hobbit or Harry Potter or game of thrones for comfort. 

I’ve also really wanted to find a DnD group or start one with friends. I’ve lost my friend groups that I was in, either cuz of proximity or drama. I’m just alone. 


That’s why I wish I was just dead. It would be so much easier than feeling alone.
