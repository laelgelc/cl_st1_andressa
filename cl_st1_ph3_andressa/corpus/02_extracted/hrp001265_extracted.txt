I’m a very active and creative person — I love expressing myself through art, staying consistent at the gym, and constantly working on becoming a better version of myself. I spend a lot of time on my own, I really miss having people to genuinely talk to. Someone to share thoughts with, check in on each other, laugh about random things, or have deeper conversations when life feels heavy.
