I couldn't sleep this night and I started to think. no one's ever celebrated my birthday with me, even my family. I never got to spend any valentine's day with anyone. I won't have anyone to go with on the prom, because I don't exist to people. Is it silly of me to think about this that much? Do I overthink?
