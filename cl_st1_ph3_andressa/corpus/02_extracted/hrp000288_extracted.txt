Everyday drains me. 

On special days, like my birthday, my family always say something bad about me, how I act, how I look, and even my friends.

I pretend it doesn't hurt. Everytime I look in the mirror, I look fine, and pretty, it always made my ego high, I loved myself. But the comments about myself made me see myself not the same way anymore. 

I try eating less, it hurts, I try being alone, it hurts, and so on. 

I have many friend groups where I feel alone in, I can imagine them without me, happy. I try to make myself happy or being used to being alone, but it never works. 

From everything I've experienced, even a simple thank you, happy birthday, greeting, or gift can make me happy. 

I'm sorry if this is too long, and I am a bit new to reddit.
