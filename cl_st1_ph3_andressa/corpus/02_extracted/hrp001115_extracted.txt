I’ve never really felt seen or understood, even as a kid it was like I was all alone and I had to just keep going. I’m trying hard to get better and to do well in uni and life but this loneliness is just killing me. I wish there was someone who understood what it feels like and wants to get better as much as I do. All “friends” I have wouldn’t really understand. I guess it’s just another fantasy I have of sharing this miserable part of my life with. Just venting right now I guess.
