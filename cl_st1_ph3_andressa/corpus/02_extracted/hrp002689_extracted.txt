hi everyone.
let me start like this!

i’m a loner , at school i don’t have friends, people call me weird , i sit alone at break time at school. people always try to talk to me or try make friends with me but nothing works 
it’s as if i don’t like socializing anymore because i think i’m more mature than the people in my grade or i don’t really feel there’s a need to have friends. 
any advice on why i’m like this ?
