15m here, after a long time of feeling like I would never find anyone worth my time, I did find someone, this was the first time I’ve had the confidence to ask somebody out ever, so I did, and I was rejected, I took it really well at first, but after a while, I began to feel like nothings ever worth it. Dealing with my parent at home is abs the worst thing in the world cause the only thing my mother seems to do half the time is yell at me, and my siblings just fucking suck in general. On another note, while I have plenty of friend, most don’t even seem to be worth it, I will admit that I‘m a femboy, but that’s only because al everyone I know makes fun of me over it and either calls me gay, a woman, or just a weirdo. I’ll also admit that I have had small sips beer before, this little known fact is very important cause I have decided to steal a beer from my parent because I feel like nothings ever worth it, and that alcohol is already my only escape, I know that this is a horrible thought mentally, but this is all I have. Life just isn’t worth it 90% of the time. I’ll probably come back tomorrow with the situation involving the beer, but yeah, I just can’t take this shit anymore
