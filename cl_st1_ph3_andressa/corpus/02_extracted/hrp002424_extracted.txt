I've been in isolation for the past 3 weeks, due to having to break from a trio friendship. I am essentially starting over and the loneliness hit me tonight. I am looking forward to meeting new friends, but it is really hard. Folks are so busy with their lives. I'm one of those people who doesn't like to interrupt other people's privacy, but I know I'll have to break the ice with a stranger at some point. But you have to be careful too, you never know who people are. Is or has anyone else been in this position of "Starting over?"
