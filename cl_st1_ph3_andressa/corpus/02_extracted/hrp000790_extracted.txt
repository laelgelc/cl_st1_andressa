I've always been kind of a loner, but I still had friends I would hang out with. I would be happy and do things with my friends, then recharge for a while by myself. I loved being alone then.

I'm 36 now. I have no more friends. I am divorced. Regularly, I go months without even speaking. I just listen to music, watch YouTube or Anime, and just carry on by myself.
I don't have any hope of ever finding another friend this late in life, and I'm afraid that, even if I did, I wouldn't even know how to properly hang out and just act like a civilized person anymore. Obviously finding a romantic interest is so off the table, there isn't even a table to begin with.

I sit in a quiet house by myself, smoking cigarettes and contemplating life. Ive taken to watching vloggers on YouTube that upload there daily lives where they also live alone,teying to find solace in knowing that other people also live this way.


If anyone else is involuntarily alone, I hope you can find at least one person to share all those pent up feelings and thoughts with.

If you are alone by choice or not, I would love to hear what sort of things you do to quell the deafening silence and full the void where others would be.
