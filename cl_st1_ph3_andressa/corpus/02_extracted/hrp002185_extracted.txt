i miss when i was the first person my friend would come to tell things to. i miss when it felt like i had a best friend for once. she found herself a lot of new friends in the past months and things have shifted quite a lot and im no longer a priority. i also feel like this is something children cry about but here i am in my adulthood feeling so empty and alone for the same reasons i did as a child. maybe it would've hurt less if i had a social life and multiple other friends too but i don't and my days feel so empty now. i just miss how our friendship used to be
