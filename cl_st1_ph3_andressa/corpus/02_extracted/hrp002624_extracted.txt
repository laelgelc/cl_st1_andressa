For the past 2 years, I've gone out with friends 0 times, I made 0 new friends, I didn't text anyone or upload to social media.

Does having 0 contact like this bring any health consequences? I'm happy alone, I feel relaxed, clean and focused on my objectives. But im wondering if im making a mistake here towards my health.
