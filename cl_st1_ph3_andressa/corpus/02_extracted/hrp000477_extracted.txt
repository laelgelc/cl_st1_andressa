that makes me go out and be alone in public feel lonelier. it's just this boredom and unable to focus anything. everything is a waste of time nothing is worth my precious attention. i read most 1-2 page of book, watch 1 episode of my tv show, dont cook at all and just question myself, download a dating app a zillionth time, feel bad about myself, sometimes go a bar and be drunk and more stupid, wishing someone will try to love me at a club. Why am i doing these things? why i just can't accept the defeat?
