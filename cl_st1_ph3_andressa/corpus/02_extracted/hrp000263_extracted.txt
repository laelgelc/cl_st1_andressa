I’m sitting here by my my little lonesome yet again, watching one of my favourite comfort movies. Monty python and the holy grail, while I snack and suffer, day four of my recovery of strep throat, and realize, I’m happy I am alone.

Not lonely, but rather I spend a  good deal of my days and nights alone.  I keep telling myself I need a partner to enjoy life with but now I feel a pet or two, as well as casual short visits with friends and family, who I have in abundance, would suffice for social contact permanently. Even now, without any pets I feel legitimately comfortable and content. 
After yet another recent dating blunder, and three days basically all alone (aside from two short friend visits to help me with penicillin).
I’m curious if I’m just meant to live in blissful solitude. Maybe it is a temporary thing but I’m 26 and I haven’t had a legitimate relationship in roughly 5 years. 

Either way, I think it’s pretty cool to be happy with oneself. Even if it freaks people out sometimes.
