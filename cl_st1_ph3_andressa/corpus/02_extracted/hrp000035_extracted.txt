Tbh when I started high school, I never thought I’d be where I’m at right now (at least socially). Three years and one relationship later though, I’ve successfully become an introvert and it fucking sucks. I miss having friends to talk with & play games with. I miss having people who reach out to me first. I’m always the one who makes plans & reaches out to others first. Shit just makes me feel so lonely. After me and my ex broke up, and quarantine hit, i realized just how much i depended on her for socializing. She was the only person i’d really talk to every day & hang out with at school. Afterwards, i did have people that i’d hang out with but once quarantine hit, we all just drifted apart. I miss having those close relationships with others. The ones where you could tell the other person all you troubles n shit. But it is what it is I guess.

Video games just aren’t the same by yourself. Youtube starts to become repetitive. I just wish I could have friendships like I did back in middle school. Growing up really does suck once all this starts happenin to ya! :)

I just hope that shit gets better in university. I’m thankful that I have more time to focus on grades but at times, it feels like that’s all I focus on & I never get to socialize but oh well.

It felt good to vent out my feelings like this tbh. Thank you if you cared to read till here. I’m excited to see what the future holds tbh, hopefully won’t be as lonely as right now!
