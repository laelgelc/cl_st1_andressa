I’m nearly 70 and I’ve never really been popular or particularly liked, despite genuinely liking people and making an effort to connect. I have a couple of "friends" but they constantly criticise so don't think they like me much. 1 of them is a narcissists so thats to be expected but there does seem to be a life long pattern.

This isn’t a crisis post — I’m independent and cope well — I'm kind, open and chatty, probably too much, after social interactions I often replay things, because I'm so used to being criticised, and feel anxious, even when nothing obvious went wrong.

I’m not looking for advice or fixing. I’d just like to hear from others who’ve had a similar experience of being generally unpopular or not quite fitting in, and how you live with that reality.

It would help to know I’m not the only one.
