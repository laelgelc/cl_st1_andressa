I've been feeling jaded since a past couple of days for what I realized has been the ongoing loneliness itching inside my heart. I want to go out with someone, write to them, wish them a good day greeting and just hold hands with them to say how much their presence matters to me. But due to my own circumstances, I am home bound and only do remote work. Has been since two years now. 

The weather's been awesome too. I can only wish I had a partner to enjoy the colors of these sceneries with. I know i need to step outside my home and go talk to people, but how much efficient would that be? Who's gonna talk to a loner? Dating apps don't work for me (not photogenic enough to be there). And I am so tired of being in this loop because it seems impossible to exit it. Are there folks who are stuck in the same position as I am?

Sorry for the rant. I know i need to do better and I suck at making progress.
