This emptiness has seeped into my bones and made a home there. 
Breathing everyone I care for in, just to bleed them out.
The torture of pacing in your head wondering why you just fade out of everyone’s life. 
Why there is nothing about you that feels important or special enough for anyone to see you. 

So day in and day out I will continue to breathe the ones I love in and watch them bleed out of everyone wound they cause me because I won’t let someone else feel this. 


To all of you who are lonely too, I’m sending you love and the strength to keep going 🖤
