Lately, I feel terribly alone and I don’t know why

I am a 19-year-old French student with friends but yet, I feel like every moment I’m being overmatched and I absolutely don’t know anyone to confide in: I think it’s driving me crazy

I can’t really blame my friends because unlike them, my life is stable and calm and every time they ask me how it’s going, I don’t know what else to say instead of "I'm fine", because I feel like saying how I feel would be ridiculous

I told myself that finding love could be the solution because it would mean that I would have found someone to talk to but it’s much easier said than done and that there are simpler solutions

But ultimately, what really disturb me with this sensation is that I become grim, thoughts I wouldn’t have thought of run through my mind and the people I meet daily disgust me more and more  with myself included.

I always felt on the sidelines but it’s today that I am the most, I think there is something wrong with me

This is my first post on reddit in my life and it might be the last one I would post, but maybe finding someone unknown with whom to discuss would do me the greatest good

I really struggle when it comes to chatting but it will always be a pleasure for me to get to know someone
