35M here.
Grew up in a broken home, messed me up more than I thought. Too much trauma, I’d rather not hurt anyone the way my parents did(to each other).

My brother once said he can’t live without a partner. I’m the opposite, I don’t even want one.

Tried dating in my 20s, but with no money, poor education, and zero stability, I knew I’d just hurt someone.

Now I’m 36. Crawled out of poverty, doing okay, but still no drive to chase more.
Maybe I’m just used to being alone.

Tried dating apps recently, but honestly, I don’t even know.

Ps: Sad isn't it. But don't worries guys. Just want to vented it out.
