This time of year is very difficult for me. I have anxiety and it seems to go through the roof this time of year. It comes to a head right after New Years. I am alone. I have tried to reach out to church and so forth. Are there any service that will allow me to call every so often or will call me?  I just want a kind friendly voice on the other end. I do work, but they aren't my friends. I also have no friends. I know I am a freak. I still would like to have a human to talk too. Does anyone know of any services that would call ?
