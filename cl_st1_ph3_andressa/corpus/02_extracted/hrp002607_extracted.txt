I have no idea how this works but hopefully im doing it right. Its quite ironic, i used to joke around with my friends about having reddit but here i am,, idt anybody gives a crap but wtv
So ive been an introverted and dependent person for the whole of my life but i guess ive gotten lucky because ive always been in the company of friends. Like even when i was bullied in pri sch, i still had friends who i keep in touch with even now, middle school, high school, all that, and ive still had close friendships. But this time in senior sch, i moved again really far away so i literally know nothing so i dont know why i expected anything but i guess it really hurts? Idk ive always been dependent and surrounded by ppl, so as an introvert i guess i took advantage of the fact that someone was going to approach me and we wld b friends. Idk like i guess it really hurts to take the fall as someone who was constantly surrounded by close friends whom i could be myself around and be so extremely stupid with,, to being the loner with headphones on that only sits at the library or in the toilets during break times. Like i sound so petty but ive struggled with mental health since as young as 10 so i guess being a loner just heightens the pain. 
My mind begins to wander to crazy places and i either cry and silently wail like hell every day or i become carefree and independent. This wavering between emotions gets me really tired and my head hurts. I find that the only thing i want is a great big hug from someone who cares. Yeah,,
And my family life had actually gotten better like my bond with them is really strong and i am conversely enjoying school but like,, does it have to come at the expense of having company? Idk im sorry for dumping my feelings out but if i didnt do this i dont think i could go on for longer. Sorry abt this,, but yeah thanks fr reading ig :>
