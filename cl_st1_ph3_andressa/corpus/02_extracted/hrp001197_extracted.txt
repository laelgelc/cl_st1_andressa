I’m in a really emotional state and I don’t want to do the alternative option I was considering because I want to retain my self respect. 

People are not emotionally smart in my life. This has been a consistent truth through the years for me and as much as I have tried being optimistic I am not in the space to be anymore. I realize now I don’t feel love for the one person I thought I had consistently for long, my best friend of many years. 

I am tired of being the one not seeking transitional things from relationships. I have been treated like a wall when I know I am more than that. I deserve to be heard out in return and have the complexity of my thoughts bounced back to me. I’m tired of giving people every ounce of thought and being met with some surface level bullshit. 

I have been a mentor, a therapist, a teacher, every role of helper. I don’t know how to not be one. I can’t keep people outside of that role, and I have no experience not being one of those things. I am used to people lashing out at me in very nasty ways when I don’t live up to what they thought I could be. I feel like connection is more of a responsibility than anything fond. I confuse basic empathy for caring about people on an intimate level. It has been my job forever to handle the emotions of people who are too scared to handle them theirselves. 

Company at this point in time is now only now to satiate my innate need for it, as a person. Any disorder I have now does not affect that. I feel lonely but it’s more disconnected, like the way you need to drink water or idk pee or whatever. I have no idea what I’m saying but maybe coming back to this I can try and piece things together.
