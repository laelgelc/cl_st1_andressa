Im 27f... and I never had relationship, not once in my whole life... I feel like Im missing out. People in my group age got children, they are getting married and Im here like... well I feel dumb. Im probably not pretty enough for a relationship, but Im starting to feel bad, like I wont ever get to know what it feels like. I live alone for two years now, I think I will just start to get cats at this point... do you feel the same sometimes?
