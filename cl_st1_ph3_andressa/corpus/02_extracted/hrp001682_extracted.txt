I've 24f always had a lonely, isolated sheltered life because of my overprotective parents. No friends, no meeting peers, never known what it is like to have irl friends. Now I'm guilt trapped into not moving away from them because they're old and always sick . My house feels like a hospital rather than a home. So damn depressing to live here and I have no choice . I have resented my mother for throwing off all her problems on me and restricting every possible attempt i had at escaping this nonsense. I feel guilty even thinking this way because they gave me a roof to live under, good food blah blah blah. But I'm just too frustrated with life now. No social skills, no one to talk to. Nothing to aim for in life because all my hobbies and ambitions died down looking at the conditions we live in. I'm so ashamed of this place.

 Don't want unsolicited advice I've had enough of that shit. Just needed to vent off some depressing thoughts.
