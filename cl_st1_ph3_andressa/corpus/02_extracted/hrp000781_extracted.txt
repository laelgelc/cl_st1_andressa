So this was my big fear.
I only have few friends that I rarely see. So I do everything alone.
I went to the cinema, library, shopping, concerts, museums,... I even prefer to be alone at cinema now.
But for the restaurant I was so scared. Like you are facing people of the other tables sometimes and it is awkward if you look straight.
I wanted to test a lot of restaurant and I did one and it was good. 
If you're curious I had a tarte flambée with a glass of Pinot Gris.
