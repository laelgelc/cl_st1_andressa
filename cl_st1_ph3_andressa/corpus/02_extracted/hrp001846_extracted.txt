I’m mentally ill and my dad supports me financially (for now). I’m 33 and due to a long life of abuse and trauma from my fantastic family plus bullying I ended up surprise surprise alone. I made myself sick with weed cuz I kept smoking too much to cope with reality and then it made me sick anyway I’ve been bed ridden with severe depression no emotional support system no friends at all and im just like if I take anymore of this ill just die. 

I’d rather get murdered out there than stay in my father’s house another second. I’m even gonna try to look for a job out there once im there just in case. Can’t take it anymore.
