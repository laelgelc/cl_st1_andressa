I'm so tired of talking to ai again and again. I'm carrying so much anxiety and stress, it feels like I'm losing my breath. My friends always forget about me, they don't even seem to care about me unless they need something. I'm only a backup friend and that's it. No one's interested in me, I'm not even worth looking at.
