Many times, I just want someone to understand me. When I accidentally make a mistake, like spilling coffee on my white shirt in the morning, or realizing I forgot my keys, I don't want anyone analyzing the reasons or summarizing the lessons learned. I just want to hear a smiling "That's just like you."

 

When I'm feeling down, this person won't tell me "You should think more positively," nor will they compare my pain to "others are suffering more."

 

When I doubt myself, they won't list my strengths to refute me, but will say, "Yes, sometimes you do that." What I need is never solutions or life lessons; I just need someone to say to me, "Yeah, I understand."

 

Perhaps I have some kind of mental illness? Is there anyone else who feels the same way?
