I'm not at all active on reddit but i got the idea to look up r/loner specifically, and was actually extremely relieved to see there's a number of people who feel the exact way I do. I've always felt guilty about it, especially because no one I know seems nearly as comfortable being alone as I do. I have friends but more often than not, when they reach out to me, I can get extremely anxious and uncomfortable. I stress about feeling like I have to make sure i'm socializing the "correct" way when i'm with people. Even with people I like, respect, and think are interesting, it's fun to see them for like a minute and then I just start counting down til I can be alone again.

The whole covid-19 thing kinda opened my eyes on this aspect of myself too. Now that i've been stuck at home and same with all my friends, I honestly still feel relieved after a month, and I haven't even felt compelled to text or call someone out of the blue. When friends reach out to me though, I feel overwhelmed and I feel like I've made a good effort whenever I have a full conversation with anyone. I thought I was introverted for a long time but part of me still feels that its wrong that I feel I'm something even more extreme than that. Anyhoo, finding this group makes me feel like I can understand this better. so thanks
