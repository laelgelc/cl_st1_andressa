{"id": "1qxs9nn", "subreddit": "SelfHate", "created_utc": 1770408219, "author": "shyboy2006", "title": "I hate everything about being a brown boy. I wish I was white or something", "selftext": "I hate everything about being a brown boy. I wish I was white or something\n\nI’m literally tearing as I’m typing all this out but For content, I’m a 19 year old brown boy from the DM(V). My parents are from Pakistan and we came to the USA in 2009. My family when they first came here were dirt poor so we moved around a lot and lived off of food stamps for quite some time. Eventually we became financially stable and we settled down\n\nGrowing up in a desi household as a boy was always traumatizing for me. I never felt safe in my household, especially around my mom who was super abusive towards me and was always mean to me. Between the age of 5 to 16, my mom would always be verbally abusive towards me and hit me all the time (like most brown parents do) if I made a simple mistake. If I made a mistake, she would cuss me out calling me the b word or the f word in Urdu or Punjabi and then hit me, and I’d go to my room and just cry in bed. I never felt safe around my mom, and whenever she want around, I’d feel less unsafe but still on edge. I wish my mom was more loving and caring towards me, I’ve only heard her say “I love you” to me four times in my entire life. I never felt any warmth or comfort from her. I swear if she changed her way today and told me to come lay with her in bed to cuddle I would do it, despite being a grown up already. \n\nFrom kindergarten all the way to 10th grade, I had a unibrow, I had a lot of people in my classes and other classes make fun of my appearance and would mock me. Even the brown boys and brown girls would make fun of me for it and I was almost never taken seriously in school. It ruined my self as teen, I tried asking my parents to shave my unibrow off but since they were heavily religious they said that only women can trim their eyebrows, eventually I got rid of it in the 10th grade but by that time, the damage it did to me was already heavily ingrained in me. and I barely had any friends in elementary/middle/high school, I would always sit at lunch by myself with no one to talk to. During recess I would try to play tag or sports with the other kids, but I was always left out. I never learned how to play basketball like the other boys or get into cars. My elementary school life was very difficult and hard. That’s how I became an introvert as well, because I still struggle talking to people because in the back of mind I was scared of failure and didn’t want to disappoint people were I was talking to and then end up ditching me and then having to be alone again. \n\nWhen it came to dating. I was felt attracted to brown women, I still am, but because we went through similar cultural experiences so it was easier for me to connect with them. I also love dark skin brown women. The problem was that they were never attracted to me. After I got rid of my unibrow, I felt like a normal boy and gained a lot of confidence, only for it to be ruined again. The brown girls I would try to talk to were never interested in me, they would say that brown boys are toxic and are mamas boys which idk where they got that from because I hate my mom to the core, and would always blame us for their problems. They mainly went for non brown men, specifically white boys and would never give me or other brown guys around me a chance, which ruined my self esteem way further because it’s like my own race of women who look just like me don’t even want to be with me. You don’t see other race of women doing that. They go on social media and make mean comments about us brown boys, saying hurtful stuff about us. I started questioning myself and my looks, It made me feel sad and depressed to know that I wasn’t a brown woman’s first preference and I dont know how to live with that, knowing that maybe they’re the only ones who can relate to me and my experiences since nobody did. \n\nThe reason why I said I wish I was born white is because my life would have been much more easier. I would have been born into a family that wasn’t that much religious or conservative and my mom would not be abusive towards me. I would have zero problem when it comes to dating and easily getting brown girls. I would have less facial hair and just hair on my body that way I wouldn’t have grew out a unibrow and get bullied for it. I still feel this way and I feel like my childhood was stolen from me and I’m still suffering from my trauma. I just feel like life as a brown man is so unfair it just makes you want to kys. From the dirty hygiene jokes, to the unibrow jokes, to not being a brown woman’s first preference, to having abusive religious parents. That’s how I’m feeling ", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1qxs9nn/i_hate_everything_about_being_a_brown_boy_i_wish/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1qxs9nn/i_hate_everything_about_being_a_brown_boy_i_wish/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Everyone around me seems so strong and certain about themselves. I can’t even stand up for myself or make a solid argument when my boyfriend and I fight.

My gift already wasn't enough to make up for all the countless hours of frustration that comes from spending time with me and all of a sudden, I am behind again.\n\n  \nI just don't want to feel this way anymore but for some reason, even if I have a good time while I am out and spending time with them, I always end up back in the same headspace of wondering how long I can actually trick myself and them into thinking things wouldn't be ten times better if I weren't there. I couldn't even keep myself from dissociating over it on a car ride home with them recently. It's like my brain retreats into itself to berate me and try to convince me that I need to just leave and let them all get on with their lives. I've been close a couple of times but every time, at the end of the day, I am just too selfish to let them be and that only gives the voice in my head more fuel to berate and reprimand myself with later-on.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1qja8st/never_happy/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1qja8st/never_happy/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I usually feel refreshed afterwards, but I may ponder on my sadness or cry over it an hour later, and associate it with my personal life. I’m a fat guy. I’m 270 pounds, 6’2, at 15. I’m unattractive, and I have a horrible narcissistic personality. I effectively hate myself. In the sense of I hate how I react or lose motivation to do things once I’ve started them. This year I have a D and a F in school, and I’ve never had below a B. I’ve never had a girlfriend, nor had a kiss, nor a situationship. I’ve been rejected 4 times, 2 of which the people who have rejected me have become my friends- and while I’m okay with that, it’s a reminder of my sad situation. I fear I may never find love, or dig myself out of this hole I’ve jumped down. This summer, I went to northwestern for a college prep program. There I met a girl named Carly. I loved her, honestly. She was stunning, outgoing, funny, and actually seemed interested in me. Or so I thought. On the last day, I overheard her talking with her friend about her “boyfriend” that I hadn’t heard of. She didn’t lead me on or anything, it’s just she was such an amazing girl and my honest favorite person I’ve ever met. She never rejected me, as I stopped trying to feel attracted towards her after I found she got a boyfriend, however it still hurts knowing I will never see such an amazing person ever again. On the last day, we all said our goodbyes. When I was about to leave, she came running down the stairs- afraid she wouldn’t get to say goodbye. She was bawling. She jumped on me, and hugged me while sobbing uncontrollably. I held her for a while, she kept saying she’d miss me, and everyone in our friend group there. I nearly cried aswell. In fact I’m crying as I’m writing this. I long for love. My best friend has been in a relationship for a year and a half, and they love other so much. I’m best friends with his girlfriend, and it makes me super happy to see their love grow. I just long for that.

I just figured I’d post it here because anytime I say anything or do anything anywhere else or to anyone else I get people telling me that either I look fine, I should eat more, blah blah blah. The thing is I don’t look how I should. I need to lose the stomach fat that apparently they just can’t see, probably because every time I wear something even slightly tight I suck in the whole time I’m with people. I’ve never been one who ate much but my parents didn’t get me into sports when I was younger no matter how badly I wanted to do them, so I never got to live an active lifestyle like I wanted. I’d play outside a lot, but then they moved out of the neighborhood and as much as they wanted to say it was the same, it wasn’t. There were no kids where they moved- it was in the middle of a highway- and they wouldn’t allow us to walk/bike to the small town a mile away. This took away almost all the exercise I could do. Despite never eating much, I never really payed attention to what I did and didn’t eat. I just had a small appetite. That changed, however, when my step father started making comments. Comments about how big my ass looked in leggings- years later I’m just now starting to try and wear them again- how when I finished a plate of food I particularly liked I’d look up to the counter thinking about maybe getting seconds, and my weight, once making fun of me and nagging me until I got onto the scale in the kitchen in front of everyone in my family; he then proceeded to make fun of me for what the scale said >!120!<. After that restricting my food started to become a conscience effort, and soon after that it was back to being something that came naturally but with an intent behind it. Then came the issues that still persist. I have like 3 different apps for tracking my calories and weight every day/night, it’s become second nature for me to spit (a small amount of throw up that comes up naturally for me whenever) whenever I’m alone and near a sink/toilet and sometimes it meant me waiting next to a toilet so when it comes- like a minute between each- I could spit and wait for more, making myself throw up (I spit when I can’t do that because I can always spit but can’t always throw up), and I walk on a treadmill with >!an incline of 10 and speed of at least 3mph for at least 45 minutes every night,!< which I know isn’t a lot but I felt was still worth mentioning. I know I eat well below my caloric limit every day (I set mine at >!833!< and never reach that) and if I feel I get close to it I throw it up. The issue is I don’t know what I am or what I have, it isn’t an ED, just eating problems, I guess?

A year to the day after, I had a stroke which should’ve killed me. Can’t find happiness anymore…contemplating suicide", "selftext": "TODAY’S HEADLINE: Golden boy in dream relationship cheated on his girl because he thought she didn’t love him anymore and now life isn’t worth living. \n\nMy relationship was great. We were in love. The sort of love that makes life sublime, in the sense that you become a better person because you both are each other’s best friend.\n\nIt truly was wonderful, and I can only hope that I gave her a memorable first kiss/sexual experience/relationship despite how it ended because I can’t imagine a better woman. Context, not excuses: I cheated after 2.5 years of happy monogamy.\n\nThroughout our relationship there were two  dry spells both lasting about 3 months, at the beginning due to her shyness, justified caution, and religious beliefs being at play, and the end: senior year of college, start of spring semester we found out her parents were getting divorced. From here on everything seemed off.\n\nIn my mind, either 1. her parents were getting split and she was naturally depressed AND/OR 2. she was no longer attracted to me… don’t get me wrong I’m not so aloof that I can’t imagine the possibility, plus I’ve heard hormonal imbalances from an IUD can have that effect in long term relationships. The IUD causing occasional physical discomfort during intercourse was also another factor I’m sure. \n\nIt just seemed like we weren’t in sync. I was staying over at her place every night at her request -if not unspoken expectation- and she once said she would be content if we only had sex once or twice a month. I responded straight up that I couldn’t see us lasting if that were the case because it already was worse than that.\n\nIn an honest moment I admitted I felt like I was an expendable piece of furniture or a roommate, whereas she was irresistible to me. I DIDN’T OWN HER, but I had tried communicating the importance of intimacy to the strength of our love to no avail. LIKE WTF SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I EVEN WAS INTO BUT SHE WOULDN’T TOUCH ME. And it’s not right to demand sex from your partner but the repeated rejections hurt like hell. \n\nSo yeah, I cheated on her after a girl was all over me while at a graduation party. As it should have, the sex sucked and the next day my girl found out because her friend was working at campus dispatch on the security cameras. \n\nI convinced myself I was prolly just some chump getting played, that she was too polite to break up with me and already had eyes on other guys, but we were planning a future and a family together and when she found out she was devastated. So I was an asshole with the wrong idea who destroyed his own life. \n\nA shitty self fulfilling prophecy of Murphy’s Law, everything that can go wrong has gone wrong. I’m living for nothing, almost broke. I just want to buy a gun because then at least death will be painless and not scary. Oh yeah which reminds me…\n \nTHE STROKE\nNot much to say here except a literal year after we broke up I had one at work. If I was home I would be dead since no one would have called 911. She actually reached out afterward in concern because it was that dire, though the initial hope I had in the hospital soon subsided because of my AVM or whatever I need to take epilepsy meds but the side effects were anger and paranoia so I’ve stopped about three months now. Apparently there’s a 94% recurrence with rebleed in my brain so I guess that’s cosmic justice. I’ve gone to therapy before, I’ve tried antidepressants. I’m a nice guy I’ve just made mistakes and I’m over it all. \n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1q2j581/its_been_15_years_since_we_broke_up_a_year_to_the/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1q2j581/its_been_15_years_since_we_broke_up_a_year_to_the/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Close to the entire 20 years of my life, stuff has only been useless 5 times. Its just so hard, my bed is filled with random shit she keeps, i literally cant even fix my sheets without moving an entire pile of HER belongings plus all the dust that collects on it. There is no space at all that is clear and peaceful, every single fucking place i turn to there is a pile of useless shit and I have to fight the urge not to cuss her out everytime i see those piles (which btw is literally everywhere). I try to help her, i constantly have to convince her to get rid of stuff but at the rate it actually works, no actual progress is made at all. I dont even have a clear desk to sit at or a clear place to sit at, the entire place is just so stifling and im unemployed and out of school atm so im just stuck here, forced to look at the pathetic excuse of a home i have a to live in. The absolute worst part is that she constantly wants me to help her clean and acts like a bitch when no one wants to help. Her idea of cleaning consists of sorting out everything, getting rid of 1 or 2 items and packing back everything. It just doesnt work at all, there is just way too much stuff, under my bed is filled with garbage bags of clothes that has remained untouched for years. The only way anything can get done is if she just dies because she is too miserable to change her ways, she doesnt care that her children live in a dump because SHE needs to keep her rubbish. Literally everyone tells her about it and she just says that nobody understands her. Its at the point where we have too many plastic forks because she always takes extra when we eat out and now we dont have any space for our actual cutlery because the storage is filled with plastic forks. I barely even have a room (which i share with my sister) because its filled with random clothes that my mom keeps, i cant even do push ups or do any exercises on the ground comfortably because there just isnt space.\n\nMy sister is another lazy fuck, since she was around 15 or 16, she started ordering me to do all her chores and would lie to my mother (who was always hanging out with her bf) that i was giving trouble when i didnt want to do her chores. At the current point (im 19, shes 25) she doesnt do anything at all, her dirty plates (with food still) stays the entire day in the room to the point where its filled with ants everyday until she comes home and needs to use the dishes again. She doesnt even wash them, she leaves them in the sink because I wash them for her. I dont even have a choice to iron her clothes for her, i started for a bit and now im stuck doing it. She also refuses to help my mother cook, clean or help me and my mother do anything at all. She lays all day in bed and acts like if it’s some quirky trait. The worst part of all is that she think she is in a higher class than most people because my dad had really good job. He did have a good job but she was 5 when he died, somehow that has translated to her thinking she is in a higher class than us. The money we collected from our dad’s old house (rent) was also owned by her. She kept it and it did help pay bills and groceries but she acted so if it hers alone, she would go out, buy food, leave the left overs for me and act like she did it because she cared about me. Literally the entire time i barely had savings and had no money to for any of my interests because she wanted to pretend she didnt have to work for money.

So my story starts with my biological father. He was a convicted pedophile and my mother still decided to get with him. Along with this my mother had been a smoker for 34 years and sadly I was born with chronic athsma, many allergies cronic insomnia anger issues, poor eyesight, epilepsy, and autism. My mother also decided to not alow me an early child hood and would instead be teaching me and educating me out of the womb to the point that I never got to experiance any childhood lessons or acts. At just 4 years old and continuing for a whole year he would r*pe me every time my mom left. It usually was only me sucking his dick but still. A year later he was sent to prison for only 5 years for the r*pe of myself and my 2 nieces. At 5 I was incredibly smart I didnt go to preschool and almost not even kindergarten. But that didnt stop everyone hating me except for a few people later on but ill get to that later. At 7 years old my step father (who I will refer to as step)came into my life and up to that point I never had a childhood at all. I though that step would bring me a childhood I would be sadly mistaken. In the begining step had bought us many things likely to get clout until he married my mother later on. I have a theory because of my mother's \"random\" brusies, flinching, and screams at night that step abuses her. At 8 years old I had been hearing alot of sexual jokes because of him saying them infront of me so I looked it up. I had been discussed at first but later looked it up again. This lead me to my p*rn addiction. This addiction would stay with me even today. Later that year I developed a d*ug and n*icotine addictions lasting until 2024 and 2021 respectively. At age 9 I started hating my body and the fact that I was 5'0 and over 230 pounds. This and my addictions lead to a self harm addition too. Normally self harm is cutting but along with that I did more of physical a*use, choking, and burning. By 10 years old my parents started to mentaly and in steps case physicaly a*use me. This was also the start of the pandemic and took a toll on my activness and socal life that I already had little of. At 12 years old much was the same but now my parents would get married and step would injure himself using a firework and sadly not dying. The pandeminc at this point was over and now I could finaly go back to school. This was when I met my 2 best and only friends my \"daughter\" and my one day girlfriend. At first I was taken under the wing of the popular kids to be a punching bag but because of my social knowledge I was completely oblivious to this. At 13 years old I joined football finaly getting active after becoming a 5'2 268 pound person with stage 4 athsma and at the same time I also started to question my gender. I had a really supportive coach my first year of football but he would be replaced the next season. Later I did track where I had gone from 268 to 220 pounds in half a year. But during all of this I had been questioning somthing. My gender. I had never though about it till p*rn but I at the time liked men aswell as women. Behind closed doors I had tried being trans and a femboy (ill get to the femboy thing later). Through this I decided I was bisexual later just becoming straight. At 13 years old I did football again this time having a horrible coach and everyone tuning on me and hating me for one thing. I had finaly got a girlfriend. This girl was apart of the \"weird kids\" and was also conciterd \"lesbian\" because of who she hung out with. But I managed to pull who I see as a gorgeous and amazing woman. I now only had one friend in football him being my best of best friends (who I will refer to as K). K was the only one who liked me and there for me as I was going though my even heaver suicidal thoughts. Because of holding them in I had 5 years of suicidal thoughts built up in me witch he was there to listen to me about. Later I joined choir and band and discovered my love for music first starting out as a clarinetist. Track season came and nothing special happened besides self consciousness. During this my girlfriend and I rushed very early in our relationship to s*xual pleasure mostly for her and almost never for me. Now at 14 years old I wanted to join marching band for my freshman year but my parents forced me into doing football even though I begged and cried they forced me to do it against my will. During football I had possibly the worst coaches and teammates ever. My teammates outright abusing and bulling me to the point I left football during week 2 of the season making my parents very mad. And this is where my story ends for now it being a new year I hope I can become better person. My relationship is going well now we have gotten control of our s*xual actions and I have gotten her a promise ring 1 and a half years into our relationship because she really is the girl for me and the woman of my dreams who I will probably end up marrying and I now play tenor saxophone and gutiar.\n\nIf you read this whole thing seriously thank you and please comment your thoughts and opinions.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1q11g4u/idk_why_im_even_posting/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1q11g4u/idk_why_im_even_posting/", "over_18": true, "removed_by_category": null}

We were talking on the porch, outside of earshot of his wife and my sister. While we were talking he admitted to me that I was his favorite niece, and that he had fantasized about me and him. He told me he wished I would ask him to have sex, and him be my first male. I’m very gay.  He also tried to kiss me and asked to see my chest. \n\nObviously I said no, and pushed him away when he tried to kiss me. But now I don’t know what to do. I’ve had an irrational (now not so much I guess) fear that all the men in my life only see me as an object of sexual nature. And it’s made me hate myself for thinking that someone who knew me from diapers would want me in that way. Now I don’t know what to say, I still love him, as an uncle, but I’m scared that the next time I see him he goes from asking to telling. He was my favorite person. I hate myself so much. I hate that people sexually want me. I just want to die. \n\nThis isn’t the first time someone has done this to me either. My stepdad, who I’m also not related to (and has known me since I was 8) told me he found me beautiful and wished he’d just met me now instead of raising me.

Not like they’re comparing themselves to me and feeling better about themselves, but the opposite. I was always the smaller one in my friend groups- shorter and skinnier- and it sometimes feels like they can’t see past that. Along with that, I’ve always been the “smart” one. Even people I’m not friends with ask what I got on the test, just to see if they got better or worse than me. If they got better it was a means for celebration, if they got worse I’m a try hard and they knew they’d get worse than me so it’s whatever. These things take a toll on my mental health though. I’m burnt out all the time, I feel like people hate me for my grades- especially because it comes easy for me and I rarely have to study- and I feel like they see me in a light that’s incorrect. My friends see me as skinny- they’re wrong. They’re all taller than me and/or are less skinny than me or just have a different body type. I have a body type where my waist is smaller than the rest of me, my ass is decent size, I have larger thighs, my boobs are small, and my stomach goes out a bit. They don’t see the flaws there though and just see that my waist goes in and my collarbones show and think I’m skinny, they don’t see I have to lose weight still. I hate how they see me because it makes me feel like I have to keep up the image and I can’t tell them how badly I want to be better, smaller. Their comments weigh on me though. I’ve always been one who doesn’t eat much, so they see me skipping meals and either wish they could, get worried, or both. A few days ago one tried to get me to eat a cheeseburger- or at least fries- and I politely refused because I wasn’t hungry and I had a Diet Coke. She looked a specific way I can’t explain and when I asked if she was okay she said no because “her best friend was wasting away”. I told her I’m far from wasting away and even if I was fries probably wouldn’t do anything to fix it. Then earlier another friend- different friend group- was telling me and another friend she was trying to lose weight. I sighed and shook my head, telling her as I always do that she didn’t need to, she needs to see how beautiful she was, but she continued and said she wanted to be skinnier. She then proceeded to say “I want to be smaller, I want to look like her” and pointed to me, and all my other friend said was people have different body types. The thing is, I know they see this as a compliment to me and don’t know how it feels for me knowing that I’m not what they think I am, and obviously I can’t tell them. Idk, I just needed to rant. Tell me any ways you know to lose weight and cut calories if you have any please, if they’re going to compare themselves to me I want to at least live up to expectations and maybe lmk if I’m just being dramatic and it’s not a big deal", "score": 4, "num_comments": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1ppk02o/others_are_constantly_comparing_themselves_to_me/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1ppk02o/others_are_constantly_comparing_themselves_to_me/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

During my graduation project, I became very isolated and stopped enjoying most of my hobbies and social activities. I struggle with friendships, dating, and motivation, and repeated rejection has hurt my confidence. I’m planning to return to my home country in February and hope to restart my life. Until then, I plan to socialize more with people I already know, work out regularly, reconnect with old friends, attend events, and push myself to meet and talk to more girls.\n\nLet me explain my situation. I’m a 23-year-old guy who just graduated in game design from a university in the Netherlands, which is great news. I currently live in a house with five other guys and have a cat. I’m planning to go back to my home country in February to try to restart my life a bit. After finishing university, I feel lost: I don’t have a clear goal, a big project to focus on, a girlfriend, or something that fully occupies my time.\n\nFor the past months, or even years, I’ve been feeling really depressed and lonely. While working on my graduation project, I barely went out because I was extremely busy. I mostly just worked and occasionally met friends for a walk or a quick trip to the store.\n\nI don’t have a girlfriend and haven’t had one for a long time. Dating apps barely work for me. My hobbies used to include volleyball, the gym, board games, video games, and passion projects. Lately, I’ve abandoned almost all of them. Volleyball was the only consistent social activity I had, but even there I’m surrounded by people I barely know. I tried making connections, but I didn’t feel the vibe, and I often felt lonely and desperate, so I stopped going.\n\nI usually prefer staying out—studying, wandering around, or working on projects—but even that stopped giving me joy. I live with other guys, and we talk sometimes, which helps, but they rarely want to go out. Occasionally, we argue about house stuff, and that makes me withdraw even more.\n\nI do have friends here, but lately everything we do—mostly walks or sometimes clubs—feels boring. Many of them are busy with their own lives and aren’t very responsive. Sometimes I get left on “seen,” and when that happens repeatedly, it really bothers me. We talk about it, but it keeps happening, and I end up pulling away.\n\nBack home, I have more friends, but it feels similar. People already have their routines, social circles, or girlfriends they’re very focused on. I don’t mind girlfriends, but when that’s the only thing they talk about or do, it makes me feel excluded.\n\nAll of this makes me feel like no one really wants to hang out with me and like getting a girlfriend is becoming harder. Recent rejections have seriously hurt my self-confidence. I’ve tried solo trips, but they only work once before I feel depressed again. It’s hard to find motivation to go back to the gym or do much of anything.\n\nUntil February and after I move back home, my plan is to try anyway: go out more with people I already know, do activities we both enjoy, meet new people through them, work out regularly, reconnect with old friends, attend events, and push myself to approach and talk to girls more often so rejection affects me less.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1pp77hk/i_need_help_getting_out_of_this_depression_before/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1pp77hk/i_need_help_getting_out_of_this_depression_before/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

To keep things short and simple, this year has been absolutely shit for me. It’s been so bad that it’s changed me as a person, and many people in my life view me differently, in a bad way. In the past I would never even think twice about back talking anybody, including my parents, but now I just don’t care, at all. I’ve had my fair share of arguments with them, they’ve hurt me, I’ve hurt them. I’m not going to lie, I’ve called my mother a bitch and she’s done the same with me. I constantly curse at or in front of my parents, and they hate it so very much. That’s just one example of me “not caring”. I used to be a very religious, caring, “innocent”, if you will, person. Now I feel that I am very vulgar and come across as hateful. Basically, my huge issue is that I don’t care about anything anymore. In fact, I’ve made it clear to my family that I really don’t give a shit about anything in my life, including myself. The worst part about this is that I don’t like that. I want to care, but I find that doing so just hurts me even more. There’s plenty of factors that could have led to my downfall, including academic stress, anxiety, isolation, etc. Anyway, the reason I’m making this post is because my grandmother just blew up at me saying I’m incredibly disrespectful and no matter what I should always respect my mother (I had an argument with her a few minutes ago). I told her that respect goes both ways, and that my mom wasn’t being so kind to me either, so I let the bitch word slip and..yeah. I just got told that she is the parent and I am the child, so it doesn’t matter what the reason for me saying it was, it was wrong. I know that it was wrong, but my issue is, again, that I don’t care enough to hold back. I’m just tired of everything in my life seemingly going wrong and my family telling me left and right that I am messed up and full of hatred. Not sure what to do here, so I would love some guidance.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1p8nglg/i_dont_care/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1p8nglg/i_dont_care/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

The reason people think pale skin and blonde hair are the best thing since sliced bread is because of brainwashing and racism, it's not a compliment, I don't look at my features as natural variation but rather a walking visual example of European oppression for some reason.

When she became a single mother, despite being a good kid, I made her life significantly harder.\n\nMy dad never wanted a kid and felt trapped with my mother. Even after they split, whenever we \"hung out\", he just left me in a room to play video games so he could go in the basement and chill. We barely talked. I don't know the guy after 31 years. He admitted that he wished I was more like other boys. Smarter, tech savvy, probably athletic, and not socially awkward. A father should be proud of his son, but all I do is bring shame.\n\nOther kids at school bullied me, ostracized me, and treated me like I was beneath them. It was rare that I found a friend. I am too short, too fat, too ugly, not athletic, didn't \"act black\", liked anime before it became cool, a fag, and broke. Sometimes, bullying me scored them cool points with their friends. \n\nMost of my teachers have shown me that I didn't matter to them like the popular kids, bad kids, or attractive kids. The mentors of the youth have already marked me off as nothing special. My 3rd grade teacher was caught off guard when I exclaimed how much I hate myself and wished I wasn't here. I remember her trying to hype the class up to convince me it wasn't true, but it never felt genuine.\n\nI won't bore you with my adult life, but as you can predict, I'm still broke, even in my \"career\" as a teacher. No real friends, and no relationships. I sometimes have to resort to spending money on Chaturbate just for a cute guy to acknowledge I exist.\n\nMy mom struggled so much and had her life ruined....just for me. A broke faggot for a son that can't even give her grandchildren or money for all of her suffering. My birth brought nothing but pain and misery for everyone around me.\n\nI hate myself so fucking much and I curse myself every day for clinging to life. I envy people who committed suicide because they are brave. No time wasted, just straight to business. \n\nTLDR: My conception ruined my mom's career, my dad implicitly showed me that he never wanted me, other kids thought I was too weird, no one ever found me attractive enough to love, and I am always stuck in the lower class/poverty line because I am a talentless shmuck with no real skills.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1oz9aer/when_your_birth_was_never_a_blessing/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1oz9aer/when_your_birth_was_never_a_blessing/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I'm currently working on a research project about something really important: people's experiences talking to healthcare professionals about suicidal thoughts or behaviors and I could really use your help. \n\nWhat's This Research About? \n\nWe want to understand what happens when you tell a healthcare professional—like a doctor, nurse, therapist, or psychiatrist—that you've been having suicidal thoughts or engaging in behaviors related to those thoughts. We're also interested in how those experiences affect your future interactions with healthcare providers. \n\nSometimes, when people share these thoughts or behaviors, their healthcare provider might overreact or underreact. Other times, they respond in a way that's helpful and meets the person's needs. It's crucial to understand how these different responses impact the people who receive them. That's why I'm asking for your participation! \n\nWho Can Participate? \n\nAnyone who has ever told a healthcare provider about their suicidal thoughts or behaviors is invited to participate in this study. \n\nYour Privacy Matters \n\nYour answers to the survey questions will be completely anonymous. We won't ask for any identifying information, and we won't keep a list of participants. Your answers will not be linked to your personal identity in any way. The survey will take about 30 minutes to an hour to complete. This research has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oklahoma State University. \n\nInterested in Helping? \n\nIf you're interested in participating, have questions about whether you're eligible, or just want to know more, please send me a direct message here or email me at [ally.dudley@okstate.edu](mailto:ally.dudley@okstate.edu). \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this! \n\nTo participate, please click on the link below: \n\n[https://okstatecas.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_2tRPhygo34yhQ3A](https://okstatecas.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2tRPhygo34yhQ3A)", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1oywryz/survey_about_experience_with_disclosing_suicidal/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1oywryz/survey_about_experience_with_disclosing_suicidal/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

So, I bought a sandwich with my own money without his knowledge, and when he asked me why I brought 1 instead of 2, I just told him that I wasn't hungry (despite actually being hungry). When we arrived home, I gave my sister her sandwich, telling her I already ate mine, and went on with my day.\n\nThis isn't the first time something like this happened, and I'd occasionaly buy things for my family. they call me generous, but I think it's just me being careless and hateful towards myself.

He was one of the few people I thought would always be there for me, and when he walked away, it felt like the ground vanished under my feet. Since then, I’ve been trying to hold myself together, but the silence he left behind is deafening. It’s this emptiness that makes me reach out to Gwen again and again, even when I know she doesn’t feel the same way. I latch onto every small interaction, every emoji, every shared opinion about a manga series, because it feels like proof that I still matter to someone even if it’s just a stranger behind a screen.\n\nMy sister doesn’t make it any easier. She keeps telling me that the only reason I want to move out of Boston is to chase Gwen, as if I’m throwing away my life for some fantasy. But that’s not it. I’m not chasing Gwen I’m running from the version of myself that’s been stuck here, drowning in memories and rejection. I know how it looks from the outside, but I don’t even want to meet Gwen in person. The thought fills me with shame. I hate myself for feeling this way about her, for turning my loneliness into something that feels wrong.\n\nIt’s not about Gwen it never really was. It’s about needing to feel connected after losing the people who were supposed to love me unconditionally. It’s about fear fear of being alone forever, fear that I’m unworthy of love, fear that if someone truly saw me, they’d walk away too. Gwen just became the vessel for all of that, the person I projected my hope onto. And I know it isn’t fair to her, or to me.\n\nI think the truth is that I’m not in love with Gwen. I’m in love with the idea that someone might finally care about me that someone might look past the broken parts and still stay. But I’m scared that no one ever will.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1or4121/i_think_ive_fallen_in_love_with_a_woman_online/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1or4121/i_think_ive_fallen_in_love_with_a_woman_online/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I know it, and I cannot stop. My entire life has been like an inferno of self hatred that consumes me. I remember hating myself in kindergarten, feeling like I didn’t even want to be looked at. Like I didn’t and do not deserve anything and I never will.\n\nI know I am beautiful, I am told constantly how beautiful I am. But I always end up feeling like such a disgusting, hideous waste of space. I know it is true. I have never had a consistent friend or partner in my life that doesn’t decide that they would be better off without me at some point. I feel like I draw people in so easily and then, once they get to know me, they end up hating me. Actually hating me.\n\nI treat people horribly because of it but only in the most indiscernible of ways. Every day is spent knowing I am the worst person in the world yet acting like I am the best. I am a complete and total narcissist. I was raised by a horrible woman and her horrible husband, and I have absorbed their absolute worst traits. I was also raised by my wonderful father and somehow I have only ever absorbed the worst parts of him too; his horrible choice in life partners and his inability to face hardships and have difficult conversations.\n\nMy late teens and early twenties were spent smoking weed constantly every single day from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. It was the only way I could ever truly feel peace or even just cope. I cannot even do that now because it makes me vomit, I cannot tolerate the physical symptoms because they always send me to the hospital. I don’t drink very often, but when I do I always go way overboard and end up either sick or acting like an insane fool.\n\nI have tried so many medications: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiety relievers, even controlled ketamine. Nothing has ever really made me feel better or even like a real person. I have been to so many therapists and psychiatrists and have even spent time in the bin before. I have asked over and over if I am bipolar, if I am a narcissist, if I have BPD, please just tell me what is wrong with me. All they ever say is that I have extreme, treatment resistant depression, anxiety, and CPTSP.\n\nI fluctuate between extreme social anxiety that leaves me unable to speak or acting out my madness without abandon. I embarrass myself in every single social situation I am in. I say weird and unsettling things. I make people so uncomfortable whether I am speaking or not.\n\nI have a college degree and a multitude of work experience, but I can’t seem to find a full time position. I soon won’t have healthcare once I age out of my parent’s plan. I feel like I am way too old to be this unstable and unreliable. I am so broke and going more and more into debt. I don’t really have a single friend I could talk to on a given day. I rely so heavily on my father and siblings that I know it wears on them. \n\nI feel like I shouldn’t be allowed in public at this point. I am so sad and so lonely and scared all of the time, I just honestly feel like I don’t even know what the point is anymore. I live in the US as a white woman, I have it so much better than so many other people. Yet I can’t help feeling so much fear and despair for the way things are going right now. This is not a world I want to live in or the person that I want to be. I have tried so so so hard to be better and take control of my situation and stop being such a horrible person, but it feels like I am only getting worse. \n\nI desperately wish I was never even born. I don’t deserve it. Killing myself would be so fucked up too becasue I know it would mess up my siblings and family even more than I do when I am alive. I hate that my selfishness is facing me at every single turn. Damned if I do. Damned if I don’t. I feel like there is literally no escape. That I could run from anyone and anything, but still be left with myself at the end of the day. It feels like the worst fate of all. That I am me and there is not one fucking thing I can do about it. I do not want to live in the world the way it is. I do not want to be me and I never ever have. What do I even do? I fucking wish lobotomies were still a thing. \n\nBeing so self aware and so fucking evil and even more insufferable is the fucking worst. There is no escape. I don’t want to think my thoughts or feel my feelings. I do not want to ever get to know another person just for them to slowly back away. I am a fucking menace and a detriment to society.

What if I had parents that stayed together, What if I actually had close friends. What if I was a bit more normal and was able to fit in? What if I grew up in a more positive environment and actually did something with my potential? What If I wasn't the complete failure that I am today? Would I still hate myself? \n\nWhat came first? Chicken or the egg? I don't know. But I often wonder if things had been different back then, would I have grown up differently. Would I have made different choices? Maybe I wouldn't have developed the learned helplessness that I have, maybe I'd be an optimistic person, instead of the pessimistic dickhead that I am. But even with all the external factors that went wrong, I suspect that internally I was always a failure. I am acutely aware that despite some of the things that happened, other people could have done so much more than what I've done in my circumstances.   \n  \nMaybe like a slowly boiling frog, things have been bad for so long, but because the decline was gradual I never had the impetus to jump out.

Did I always want to die? \n\nThese thoughts were there in Grade 3 when I couldn't make sports teams, when friendship groups excluded me. These thoughts were there in Highschool when bullies were chasing me and my one friend with hockey sticks. And despite my good grades and athletic achievements, those thoughts never went away.

Nothing ever fills the hole inside and the fact that my entire persona is a facade.   \n  \nGetting a masters degree did nothing. Winning sporting trophies did nothing. My accolades are hidden away and are a source of shame for me. How the fuck did I fool people into giving me these things, because I never deserved them and I never felt like I earned them.

There was a period (about 15 to 19) where I went through a Pseudo-Self care phase where I gained an ego; but it wasn't about loving myself, it was about defiance against those who had made me feel lesser. Then I went to trade school for a year and everything I thought I knew was proven wrong. With that I began to realize I still held a lot of self hatred, not only that but I almost don't feel any desire to be different.\n\nSelf Love doesn't make sense to me; people tend to think of love through a \"you either feel it or you don't,\" mentality. There are only two areas where there's an exception: your child or yourself. I love myself because I don't feel love for myself. Almost everything I've done in life has been negated by my own incompetence. I was born with a soul that longed to be and was capable of being extraordinary, but was trapped by my own worthlessness. Therefore, I punish myself for imprisioning this soul. Every positive one could name about me has a catch.\n\nVery few endeavors in my life have been successful, even now the only one I can think of is meeting my girlfriend. I have the desire to learn but a defective brain that feels constantly like it's flooded with bath water. I'm perpetually dissatisfied with my life and every effort I've made to change it has been futile and it's not like I wasn't doing anything, but I always feel like a baby learning to walk, for most of my life I've felt that.\n\nWhen I think about everything I need to improve I feel overwhelmed: I need to improve my memory, I need to improve my mental clarity, I need to improve my drawing, I need to improve my health, I need to improve my insight, I need to improve my attention span, I need to improve everything.\n\nI feel like I'm zooming towards a death where I feel the exact same as I do now. The beauty I long for, I worry doesn't actually exist. I just want to feel alive, but the attempts I've made at improving my life has been exhausting. The only improvements I've made is that my neurosis have ceased to hurt others. I see no reason to love myself, as I am the perfect combination of longing for a better life while being completely impotent to change anything, I'm still just as worthless as I ever was.\n\nPeople call me intelligent but all I've done is regurgitate the little information my horrid memory allowed, from books I never read.

I have so much vigorous hatred towards my mind.", "selftext": "I am well aware that my problems are in my head. I know that I am a fully mentally capable adult. I do not have any mental handicaps or mental illnesses. I am honestly too lazy to live. I can do everything a normal person can. I feel like a freak alien pretending to be a human and I think people can sense that something is off when they interact with me.\n\nI can be responsible but I just do not try hard enough. I know my life is falling to pieces but I am too lazy to fix it. I know I could always be bettering myself, I just know my inner brain is choosing not to let me progress. I desperately want to make a good life for myself but I'm too lazy and stupid to understand anything a normal person would.\n\nI just want to rant about how bad my brain is. I understand many things, I've had jobs and I've taken some community college classes from time to time, I was going to major in phlebotomy. This was in 2023. Throughout my entire life I have always been *different*. I come across as slow if you've ever spoken to me. I always took extra long to get assignments done in school and I never really had true friends growing up. I would talk to people but then they'd quickly just disappear. I've always felt so detached and dissociated from life ever since I was a baby. I always felt like I've been watching a movie while I sit inside my head.\n\nI don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I'm just broken to the core. I'm not like other women my age, they are so beautiful and have friends and can speak without mixing up their words, some are comfortable with their appearances. I don't even feel human nor alive anymore. I'm just a ghost trying to pilot a body. They are just themselves and I wish I was comfortable with myself like how they are...\n\nThey don't panic when people speak to them. They don't slouch to hide their bodies or wear the same tattered hoodie for 3 years straight like how I do... I remember crying when I started maturing physically. I am just too childish and refuse to grow up even though I desperately want to be like everyone else my age I am so desperate that I get physically dizzy when I overthink.\n\nI sound like a child with my speech patterns and I can tell that people look at me with pity. I am too stupid to even use my brain anymore. I am trying to subtract fractions in a computer math program and it's so embarrassing to be stuck at an elementary math level. I have passed geometry and algebra classes in high school because I studied like hell to learn it meanwhile everyone else understood the material fast and easy.\n\nI wish I could be put into a medically induced coma for the rest of my life.\n\n**EDIT:**  To tell you how bad it is, I cant even understand a simple question people ask. I'm always daydreaming and cant stop. It is physically painful inside my skull to be present and grounded in reality. I am broken beyond repair I cant fix myself it is over.\n\nI feel like my brain is screaming at me whenever i force myself to snap into reality. i wish i was normal. i cant follow directions i cant even drive that is how much of a **moron** i am. I hope my country makes a program where mentally defective lazy people like myself can opt to end themselves for the greater good of society. \n\nI am embarrassment to my family and they definitely didn't expect me to turn into THIS THING. I used to be their wonder girl. They had so much hope for me when I was little. They probably thought i'd turn out super smart and beautiful. But I'm a shy socially inept possibly mentally disabled tomboy who hides behind layers upon layers of clothes. I hate looking like a woman. I'm stupid and being \"smart\" is not true despite what they say out of pity to me. \n\nI don't deserve to shower or eat. I don't deserve my loving fiance. I don't even know why he is so in love with me. I look (and feel) like a zombie and I am a person without identity and no personality no hobbies and no interests. I HATE MYSELF.  \n\nI almost veered onto the sidewalk when I practiced driving the student driver car today at the program I am in. I am too stupid to retain information. I really do think I am broken... People like me should die. I am a waste of food and oxygen and materials. I fantasize about pressing a button where I die and a kid with cancer gets to live instead of a lazy bum like me.\n\nThanks for reading.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1o6jhr0/sometimes_i_genuinely_think_im_mentally/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1o6jhr0/sometimes_i_genuinely_think_im_mentally/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Sounds petulant, sounds stupid, whatever, it goes here. I know it might be ignored, it is fairly dramatized when I know 99% of you are going through worse. I just don't want to write another doc that'll sit in my files like a call to the void. I just want someone to hear me. I'm not doing so hot.\n\nI've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was thirteen, which is just about the average for most kids with too much internet access, lol. Never really had a stable baseline in my moods, it's always fluctuated between manic energy and horrible lows. Feeling this depressed, then bouncing off the walls. I guess I just figured I would live with it, save my energy on the low days, take advantage of the highs to get shit done. It worked for me, I had a system. \n\nIt works about right until you're downing two and three cans of energy drinks just to match your usual disposition. I am known as the bubbly, happy go lucky friend most days. To my outer circle that might as well be every day. If I falter a little I'm a fake person, or just someone who can't really be trusted, you know? What could be under that? Yikes, she's masking! Lol. I can't tell people how I feel in any circle. Either I haven't embraced the suck enough, or I'm trying to get attention from it. Sometimes I feel like I'm baiting it, even today. I don't *always* want to do it, just on my lows, and I feel low real easy. I don't actually kill myself, but I say I want to, I paradoxically feel like I'm baiting for sympathy. I prefer to drown in silence. I prefer to hold it in, die offscreen, maybe then I can be taken seriously.\n\nI won't be doing anything, though. I hope no one mourns prematurely. I don't even cut myself when I want to, too afraid of pain and too willing to show skin in public, can you imagine? I'd get caught in two seconds lol. I used to slice up my thigh back when I was around 14, went to the beach and had an aunt point at it and exclaim exactly what it was. Room was blessedly silent, we moved on. So yeah, formative experience! Don't fucking do it! You'll get chlamydia and die. Scar is almost gone by now, too.\n\nI grew up with only one parent, my dad died from cancer when I was young. Save your daddy issues jokes for the comments, I haven't heard any yet, had to make them up myself. Got homeschooled after elementary, all my friendships so far have ended. They aren't to blame for it, I just stopped having the energy to keep it up, felt guilty, cut it off for their sake. Not really a sob story. I'm a paranoid kind of bitch, always been anxious till my nails turn blue. I don't trust anyone. At this point it's a toss'up if I'm as loving as I think I am, I can be pretty shitty! I HAVE been shitty! To people I love, who did not deserve it! Don't think I'm a victim of anyone besides myself here. Maybe this is the post where you instead shine the lens on OP. I'm not saccharine! \n\nNever had a job, no one has ever wanted to date me (shocker!), don't know how to drive, dropped out of art school to pursue STEM, (which should be a joke in of itself), never had those cute little highschool moments, and I'm still an immature person when others have long been able to do shit with their lives.\n\nI feel like a joke. I should be able to work. I should be able to function in society. I have good health and I'm not poor. My mom should be retiring instead of keeping me, I'm going to become a basement femcel at this rate, what the fuck! \n\nBut I haven't changed. My day is distraction after distraction. I keep getting rejected from every school I apply to. Guess I love feeling bad about myself. Love it enough to cry to Reddit instead of hold it in a bit better. I don't even know how to keep my home clean for more than a week.\n\nI'm in my best years, but this year's been killer. Deleted my entire portfolio in april, cut off friends too. Isolated myself all year. I don't go outside. Hardly find it in myself to look nice outside of days where I must. Most days I feel disgusting. Some days I feel like royalty. Sometimes I just think about killing myself after every inconvenience, to the point that it's white noise. That's some midwest emo shit, man. Had days this year where I didn't get out of bed, kept thinking about ways to escape. Worried my family, had my locks broken. \n\nMy family loves me. I come from a nice family. I have nothing to complain about. And yet I hate myself and everything I have become. I feel like a true sink. Pour and pour all your resources into me. All of your hopes. All of your wishes. Your energy. And out comes trash. Residue. \n\nI think that's what hurts most. But if I kill myself it'll only be a final bras d'honneur to my family. It's just us three. So I can only hope I get to pulling some weight. Hopefully the high comes soon. Otherwise, I know myself pretty well, I won't do anything stupid and got a good few years in me. \n\nSo yeah. Turning 21 and I haven't done shit with my life. 21 and I haven't lived. 21 and I hate myself. 21 and I have no friends. 21 and I am fundamentally alone, because no one really knows me. No one sees every side to me. 90% of the people I know would mourn me for less than a week. I only have an impact on three people. Three. 21 and I have no life skills.\n\nWhen I look back... there's just no substance to make up for all I have taken. \n\nI'll cut it here, it seems like I'll repeat myself past this point.\n\nThis is a real stream-of-consciousness type post, lol. Before you ask, yes, my family knows and tries to help me, yes, I have been called bipolar, yes, I likely have ADHD, no, I have not been diagnosed, so take this with a grain of salt since I'm not about to rely on those terms. \n\nI legitimately wish I had a happy ending to this. Imagine the poor fuck who reads this and gets a worse day? I'm so sorry. This is a generic depression post, dude. Kind of why I put it in this subreddit. Dead dove type beat. A bit regretful that the rules force you to be nice, though. Would've preferred honesty?

I've loved her since 8th grade. She's now dating a guy and there came a point where I really truly on God's word thought it was best for both her and I if we stopped talking. A 27 year old single male with no future versus a guy who has a house with the most beautiful girl ive ever seen and cant get over... the only good thing about talking is i would learn new ways to hate myself. And that's not good for either of us. \n\nSo after some sleepless nights, I sent a message to, who I will refer to as Cooper, \"hey, I'm sorry, really and truly, but I can not get over you. It's not fair to you, nor to myself, knowing you're happily dating a guy who protects you and makes you happy. We need to stop talking.\" So we did, we stopped chatting, and this was... March? February? Of 2025 of course. So flash forward to October 3rd 2025, and I'm \"fine\". 2 months now without a day off, a whole workplace who has my back in general, and nothing but encouragment from the few I let in on Cooper and I's 12ish year story. Then her brother walks in. \n\nI thought I recognized his last name, innocently asked him how I knew him, and he said \"Yeah you went to High School with my sister Cooper.\" My face went beet red and it's now 3am on Oct. 4th. I fucking hate myself. What kind of piece of shit human am I to be so mentally conflicted about a girl I haven't spoken to in 6 months and made peace with the fact I'll never be with her? I've wanted to build a life with her since 8th. Fucking. Grade. And now 6 months sober of thinking of her everyday, her BROTHER comes in and reminds me of not just that she's out there, but HE REMEMEBRED ME!!! I haven’t seen him since 20 FUCKING 16, 9 YEARS, AND HE REMEMBERS ME? \n\nI've been in my own head all fucking night. My coworker went into a hallucination-like mental state 2 weeks ago, I was already beating myself up for over-working him to insanity which, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE I DID! But NOW I don't just have HIM on my mind, but COOPER, who I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT, FOR 6, FUCKING, MONTHS. And her BROTHER remembers me. I hate every fiber of my being, I somehow managed to royally fuck up my coworker's mind, I put myself in a RETAIL PISITION AT 27 YEARS OLD WITH NO FORESEEABLE ACTIONS ON MY ASPERATIONS, and NOW, I'm reminded of my BIGGEST failure EVER, Cooper, who I'd give my entire world up for just to hug her 1 more time without any guilt or \"is this right?\" In my head. \n\nThere is no winning this. I despise all I am, and Christ I know you died for me but right now I may be at the lowest I've ever been. Im overworked, tired, desperate for human connection, and now ready to throw it all away because of a guy who was kind and curtious to me. What kind of friend am I? What kind of human does this to someone else? To themselves? I'm so fucking sorry. I'd say it a million times and it wouldn't be enough. I'm just. Sorry. If I could dissappear without hurting anyone I would, but it's one of God's gifts that I can't. And for that too, above all else, I'm so sorry God. I love you, and I ask you, please.

I think it was turned off sometime last month. I have a pet. My pet was noisy. I wanted to stop feeding it so it would die and stop annoying me. This is scary. Last time my ability to care was turned off was many years ago. My grandma was dying. I wasn’t sad, I was happy because I was getting stuff from her will. I stayed off for about 2 years. \nI recently thought about stealing from work because I didn’t have money on me and I wanted a snack. I will not steal. I will continue to feed my pet. I know that when my emotions turn back on, I will be sad if it is gone. \nThe reason I believe my emotions were turned off last month is because before, every time I made a mistake, upset, or angered someone, I would secretly harm myself in order to “make it right”.

As a kid, I was cheerful, spontaneous, fun, caring, and had many genuine friends (both male and female). Like any child, I had flaws,I could be fearful, naughty, mischievous, and lazy at times, but overall, my childhood was good.\n\nThings changed in my teens, especially in 9th and 10th grade. Puberty made me self-conscious, fading my happy-go-lucky attitude. I got bullied and isolated in class. At home, there was constant pressure to crack JEE in a dysfunctional family. I lost self-respect and self-esteem, realizing my school friends just tolerated me, not cared.\n\nIn 11th and 12th, I noticed even close people didn't respect me, reflecting my own lack of self-respect. I immersed myself in JEE prep to tune out the noise. In 12th, I was wrongly accused in a sensitive issue involving a woman (I don't want to discuss details). Despite being a top candidate, I failed JEE mains miserably. My sister, father, and mother were furious; I got harsh scoldings and seriously considered suicide for being an utter failure. But I remembered my mother's 9-month suffering and my father's 13-15 hour workdays for my education, so I stopped. I apologized and vowed to turn things around in B.Tech for a high-paying job.\n\nIn B.Tech, perceptions didn't change. I had a small group where I was the glue keeping it together, but once they bonded, they kept me out of pity,I was always with them but felt alone. I didn't land a good job as expected,i landed decent job. Now at 23, nothing's improved.\n\nMy main issue: How do I change my attitude, behavior, and mindset so people at least see me, respect me, and view me as a real friend?\n\nMy pros:  \n- Caring  \n- Good friend  \n- Honest  \n- Cool (I think)  \n- Genuinely look after people in my life  \n- Family first  \n- Smart  \n- Hardworking  \n- Sometimes mature  \n\nMy cons:  \n- Porn addict  \n- Overthinker  \n- Hate myself  \n- No self-like or respect  \n- Very very pessimistic mindset  \n- Sometimes envious of others' success  \n- Feel unloved  \n- Don't know how to communicate(but I am extrovert and when I am with them they seem to enjoy my talks, my jokes)\n- Sometimes immature  \n- Sometimes inconsiderate without realizing \n\nI'm not seeking external validation,I don't care if people dislike my hobbies. I think I'm a normal guy aside from a few issues, but once people get to know me, they avoid me, don't respect me, or care. If asked, they'd say I'm \"cool\" or \"normal,\" but I end up ignored and isolated.\n\nIs it something that picked up when I was kid? Didn't i hit my puberoty correctly?\nAm I not mature enought to behave as adults?\nIs somepart of my brain is yet to develop?\n\nI know it's not something seriously wrong(of maybe it is)with me, but I can't pinpoint what I'm unknowingly exuding that makes people hate or avoid me. Is it some tiny detail I'm doing without knowing?\n\nI'm open to any suggestions: YouTube videos to watch, books to read, routines or detoxes to follow, or even consulting a psychiatrist,I'll do it. Just give me advice on where to start.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1nj0cpx/need_advice_on_attitude_character_behaviour_change/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1nj0cpx/need_advice_on_attitude_character_behaviour_change/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

No I'm cannot get surgery though I need it because of other medical complex issues (not financial). So badically, unlike normal people, I look horrendous eating as well as smiling, laughing anything involving the mouth and eyes. To think...how stupid i look when I put on that happy face that they put on everytime they are gonna get the food they love. BUT ME? I look sooo stupid! Like a total dork. It only adds to the shame, so I hate food now. It doesnt matter how gently I try to eat with my mouth closed too, I just naturally look gross no matter what. I hate that I'm feeding this stupid body and face. I try to eat less to take up less space physically, though I'm already skinny. Nobody likes trash taking up the space, and Im garbage of course. \n\nIm a christian and Im truly convinced God designed me with only one purpose: the purpose of being sabotaged to the point of being burnt out and also for the sole purpose of being humiliated. I dont understand why though. Like, I'm not asking to be loved (I really dont care to be honestly, im dead inside lol), I just dont want anyone hurting me, thats all. But ive been chosen to be the emobidment of humiliation. Being normal from birth is apparently too much to ask for from my own Creator and to be treated normally by society. \n\n\nIm not sure how much more I could take, im fed up with the constant persistent shame. Like I get it! Im trash okay! Now what!? Can I just be left alone....for once. Im tired of making dresses look hideous too. Its like everything I wear becomes monstrous. I'd literally cry out of shame if somebody were to gift me makeup, dresses hells jewelry, cake, a mirror, or anything with food or hair styling products. I cried when my mother purchased me a light pink sweetheart neckline with a heart type of blouse. Its nice...but not on me!

Most people dont have a deformed chin and weak face features with wide set eyes, yet I do....Ive been told I look so weird and they're right. So when I see other women (including the elderly) who look at least decent, I feel my heart sink. To think, I'm like a shrimp sitting on a bench, I feel this horrible longing and emptiness to realize I have NO value. I feel like a creep when I watch makeup tutorials like I cant fucking relate to any woman on there because despite being a woman myself, I am nothing like them physically. I look a like a fake, so non human.\n\nAnd dont even want to look beautiful, I just want to look normal, thats all. Its embarrassing to think THIS is the face and body and hair that God have me (or nature if you dont believe in him, whatever though). I want to hide all of it. Im aromantic, but when I see romance movies, i think \"ew\" but also\" despite me not being interested, I hate to think THIS is what someone would have to see, if they saw me head to toe\". I feel total shame. I doesnt matter how skinny, how much if wash my face,how much I do my hair, its never good enough when you look \"sooOOoo weird!!!\" Contrary, if anyone ever wanted me (which of course no one ever has, does or ever will, and im fine with that cuz I'm aromantic anyway) they'd actually be doing me a FAVOR, though unwanted, but a favor nonetheless. This puts extra shame on top of the former.\n\n\nAlso, eating triggers me because I look extra ugly when my face moves as I chew, even though I chew with my mouth closed.\n\nSo many thoughts run through my head ugh. The fact nature/God/or whatever put more effort into making a plant look nice but NOT me. Really shows how little thought was put into me, or genetics basically. I'm an \"after thought\". It was bad enough being born as a female, even worse to have fenale health problems, genetic health problems AND being ugly as well as being so sick that I missed out on ALL my prime years (and srill missing out, im too ill to even go outside like a normal healthy person). Not even my voice is nice. Total humillaiton. I wanna die. Badly. im not sure how much more I could take because this isnt even the only problem i have, I have chronic problems going on for years, and Im only getting uglier with time as well.

Trigger warning for those who feel the same. May be nsfw.", "selftext": "I hate being an ugly young woman. I’m 20 years old still being affected by the mean comments I’ve gotten in school. As a kid I thought I would be so beautiful when I grew up, because I thought I was ugly then too. But nope. I got to high school, I was overweight, I got small, hooded, downturned, dark, uninteresting eyes, I’m a black woman, with a fat nose, and small lips. Makeup can’t even look right on me. It’s either barely visible or makes me look like I belong in a circus. I didn’t originally wanna come on here making a fuss about what I look like, but recently I started talking to a guy online. And I wanna FaceTime him to make sure he’s not a catfish but there’s only one problem. I’m not cute. And if he is who he says he is then I’m screwed. The only type of men that approach me to call me attractive are usually 14-50 years older than me and it hurts because I know these men aren’t approaching me because they think I look young, it’s because they think I look good for being damn near 40 when I’m only 20. I can get decent photos with angles in the right lighting but if you saw me in real life you’d dread the thought of me approaching you. I feel like I have a decent personality, not being considered ever made me turn to entertainment, so I can tell a good joke, a story, an event, I can give great advice, and defend myself if need be. But I can’t convince myself that I’m beautiful or even normal looking because how can I if there was never proof of that? I’m one of those women who thinks she looks like a man and honestly no one can convince me otherwise because I’m not even worth a toxic relationship (not that I want anything like that, it sucks though that I envy those who are in any kind of romantic relationship because I know no one I would want would ever want me.) I guess I wanna know how I can stop being so hung up on my looks. I’m putting effort into making a career for myself, I’m going to school for computer science, I’m trying to distract myself from my disgusting face but any time the topic of beauty is brought up I can’t help but sink back into the hole that is self-pity. And it sucks cheeks. How do I stop caring about what I look like? How do I stop craving the feeling of wanting someone to find me beautiful whenever the topic of love or relationships or even just having friendships with men come up? How do I accept that I’ll be ugly until I can get enough money to afford plastic surgery and still be happy with myself while waiting for that time? How do I accept that if I never change I either have to settle for someone I wouldn’t want to kiss, or be single forever never knowing what it’s like to have that genuine intimate love? How do I accept the fact that no man thinks I’m pretty enough to give me good experiences during sex to keep me coming back? How do I accept it? Can someone please tell me how they did it? Because I feel like I’m drowning. When I voice my concerns to other people they just get frustrated with me, they say they understand, and that they’ve been in the same boat, and then in the next moment their on the phone with a person they find attractive that is also attracted to them. A person that also wants to see their face, a person that also wants to know about them. I tell them, I don’t receive that, they tell me it’s because I don’t go out. As if I hadn’t worked in the outside world. As if I hadn’t gone to school. Sure maybe I don’t go to the young people events, or festivals, or concerts, I also have really bad social anxiety. I notice when I’m in public people often look at me with disgust in their expressions and maybe that’s just me over analyzing everything, but it doesn’t change the fact that whenever someone wants somebody to disrespect or insult, and I’m there, they choose me. I get anxiety around men, no matter what they look like. All my friends are women. I can’t even make one dude friend. And because I was bullied, now if a man is nice to me and we get close, I catch feelings and it’s so dumb of me because I know I couldn’t get them to like me back even if I bought everything they ever wanted, even if I made them laugh so hard their stomach hurts, even if I possessed every single green flag in existence, none of that matter because of how I look. How do I get over this without just distracting myself until I look in the mirror again? Because I already do that every single day. How do I accept that I am ugly and not be hurt by that fact? How do I accept knowing that I’ll never be able to experience anything similar to what the people in my life have experienced? Does anyone know? And I’m sorry if this happens to offend anyone. I know there are plenty of men who appreciate a good attitude or personality, but looks do play a part in who we choose to talk to when I comes to wanting to be social, at least that seems to be the way my life turned out, and no one is looking at me and thinking “oh I want to get to know her. I wanna talk to her and exchange ideas and life stories,” I want to be pretty so bad, please tell me how to stop wanting that.

My response is always the same. \n“I’ll do my best.”\nI don’t mean it. It’s just a habit at this point. The words leave my tongue before I even realize I’m saying them. And I don’t mean them. I don’t want to do my best. I gave my best so many times in the past, gave everything I had, and got nowhere, nothing but hurt, scarred, beaten, abused, neglected, forgotten. So why would I do my best now? Why would I want to do my best when it’s done nothing but get me hurt before? If I wanted to hurt I’d just do it to myself. But that’s not the point here.\nI was in an abusive relationship 6 or so years ago. My gf at the time beat the shit out of me almost daily. Berated me, downed me, told me I wasn’t good enough and never would be. That I’d never matter to anyone. Never make a difference in anybody’s life. All I did, all I do, is bring pain and hurt to everyone around me. She tried to even kill me one time. When she failed she said she was just trying to stop me from hurting anyone else. She loved watching me hurt, making me hurt if she could. Physically, emotionally, she liked to watch me break, loved making me break herself.\nI used to have a quote I loved. “I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.” I used to say it just to say it. But now, seeing all these people’s worlds I’ve destroyed, all the people I’ve lost to suicide, the ones who left letters or notes to me talking about how I was the one who pushed them over the edge, how it was my fault their families had to lose them, I truly think I am death. Living, breathing, death. \nI feel numb, emotionless. I used to be happy, I used to bring a smile with me everywhere I went, but now, now I can’t even find it sometimes. Sometimes that want to make someone’s day better just eludes me. The want to help others who are struggling, because I’ve been there and know the pain of dealing with it on your own, but it just escapes me because nobody wants to help me. Nobody cares that I’m broken, beaten, left defeated at my own hands or someone else’s, because I trusted someone who promised me the world, showed me how to be my true self, helped me learn not to be scared to open up to them, not to hide the REAL me, they said no matter how fucked up I am that they would be here for me, just to rip the rug from beneath my feet and watch as I stumbled, struggling to stand back up as they walked away from me, from everything we had, everything I sunk my life into as I tried to create a better future for them, for myself. I gave them my heart to watch them crush it before my eyes, just to drop it and walk away. \nSo what’s the point in trying your best for anything when you’ve given your best just to be forgotten about in the end? Why should I try my best to “be safe” or “take care of myself” when I hate myself so much for being so stupid? I am stupid. Stupid for believing someone when they say they love me, or that they’ll never leave, never hate me no matter what I do. \nBecause they all leave. They all hate me. They all want to see me be broken so they can stomp on the pieces of me as I drown in my own head. As the voices in the back of my mind call to me, reaching out with their cold hands as they coax me down, dropping me into depression and spiraling until all I feel is the pain, the hatred for myself for not being able to forgive myself for every wrong thing I’ve ever done. I despise the man I am, the weight, the trauma I carry every day, with every scar in my skin, every burn I’ve inflicted into my flesh, every night I’ve sat awake, unable to move, unable to even cry, as I stared down the barrel or held those bottles of pills in my hands and considered downing them. And I’m done with it. I’m done being broken, left behind, forgotten, hated. Because nobody can hate me more than I hate myself. And nobody is going to break me more than I can break myself. \nI’m done.

Im not going to snap or anything, i just HATE this feeling. but i love not being able to be hurt. it truly is a paradox. schrodinger’s personality I guess u could call it if thats even a thing. i dont know. i cant even type this all out, theres so much piling up in my brain that i’d practically need a 24 hour therapy session to unload it all. but ill be fine. i know i will be. its just one of those moments now where i really reflect back on everything and see myself for who I truly am inside. still a scared little boy in the body of a man who walks around pretending like everything is fine.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1n2w2p5/my_life_feels_like_a_paradox/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1n2w2p5/my_life_feels_like_a_paradox/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

The fact this is the only chance we get at life here and some of us were born and set up for pure failure. \n\nPart of my religion tells us we will get eternal life. No matter what is true, one thing remains: I will never get to be what I wanted. So whether I'm in the grace eternally unconscious and dead, I never knew peace (that can only experienced conciously), yet if I were concious eternally I will always be what I am now: Just another uggo pathetic loser like the outcast, hunchback of Notre Dame. So either i went to the grave unhappy (never died happy), or either I go to an afterlife unhappy (where I remain eternally concious and hideous). Neither choice is good, but I prefer the first. People have no fucking idea what its like to for us uggos to be at the bottom. Its like being an animal in a cage and watching every other dog next to you get set free and be loved and happy while no one adopts you because you are ugly and a pity to gock at. Pity makes me feel thus shame because its an acknowledgement of the other party that you are socially inferior. Not just that, but the fact that Im told God will keep me looking like this forever but that I won't kind because I'll be in peace in heaven makes me feel double the worse. Why? Because the fact his feelings matter more than mine. Thats like saying \"No, no, you'd dont need to look any different, youre fine and I'll make everyone think you are fine, so no one thinks you look terrible anymore\", so basically solving everyone else's feelings...except mine....my feelings will never be honored. Thats the equivalent of saying \"you don't deserve to have what you want, so I'll do everything I can to tap dance around it and solve everything around it, except solve the CORE problem (my hideouesness). Why not just solve me? Instead of making it so complicated. Right...because everyone else matters, except me, right? Thats what people do. When you arent valued, they'll take painstakingly long efforts to do everything except help YOU. Thus, I feel shame to realize, that I'm not even minimally worthy of being fixed up. I dont want to live forever like that, because thats a punishment, not a gift. Thats eternally humilliation. Compare it to being forced into a marriage tou never wanted or asked for, then being told to be greatful, and then when you ask for a divorce legally, being told that instead, they will help you love your spouse (whom you dont love), insetad of letting you go FREELY. \n\nAnd yet, even from an atheistic point of view, i feel just as bad. To know that most have the freedom to at least achieve something in life, that I cant. Not even mininmally get a sustainable job (i was born with chronic pain and illness). And if i ever do, not being able to retire plus being burnt out beyond the average person. Thats why i say im a loser. Why wait to die old with more pain? Its not like anything is changing tomorrow. I dont want to know more pain or life. It will be my fault if I do, because ive been stupid enough to keep going in life with mt delusional self. If i died today, it will be the samw as having died years later, because nothing can be changed. And yet, even if i \"had it all\" suddenly, theres one thing i cam never have; to have been born not hideous. Sure, maybe I'm not the worst, but to know most people like decent while I dont. Plus again, poor health with no cure. No freedom and so on. Like how TF can I be so ugly that other people poont it out while the \"ugly average joe\" is left alone, not bullied and can have peace in society? This is a humilliaiton. I cant wait to be gone. There's nothing more that i hate than my own existence because the longing of looking normal will never exist. I will forever, and always be, the \"one who was hideous\" even if i was miraculously changed. I will carry this stain forever. My longing thus, can only be put to rest through death (id presumed no afterlife follows after it), even though I perhaps, will never experience concious rest because as I said, peace can only be experienced conciously, not by being dead. However if life continues, then Im already grieving without realizing what is to come for me (eternal misery). At least there would be a moment of unconsciousness though, (since when youre dying we often black out because of the pain and brain shutting down of course).\n\n\nIm tired of being and looking disgusting at every angle, nothing admirable, and its more shameful than say, a person being dusty and naked in a public scenario. I feel \"exposed and disgusted\" all the time. Now use this as this basis for almost everything I do. When I eat? Shame. People hugging me? Shame. It only increases, it adds wood to the fire that is consuming me poetically speaking, and I just cant take it anymore.

I used and I told her that I had acted out Christmas Eve. This of course hurt my spouse tremendously. One of the shittiest things I have ever done.  She was trying to work through all this with my behavior having endured the 6.5 years we had been married at that time with mostly acting out and some brief periods of abstinence. While she worked it out for herself she felt more and more panic she then worried I was physically abusing our children and reported this to their pediatricians and they contacted police and had an advocate of some kind who evaluated them. They concluded that there were no signs of \"recent abuse.\"  \nI admit that I was more physical with them than I should have been I would become irritable and yell while also picking them up forcibly.  \n  \nI have not acted out seriously in months with pornography but I denied my problem for nearly 6.5 years and did nothing serious to resolve the problem. I did not help around our home very much for a long time and when she would ask I would help for a little bit then become selfish again not helping much. She has stated that she is tired of asking me more than once and is done doing so. I also realized that I have been a manipulative piece of shit as well I would essentially ask her things like, \"should I quit video games,\" hoping she would give me permission. Or I would ask her questions to get her to stroke my ego about how good or bad of a person I was for how I had treated her. I was manipulative as shit and I hate myself for that too.  \n  \nOur marriage is emotionally dead. I overheard her speaking to someone else about our marriage once and heard her say that, \"I feel nothing anymore towards him.\" She also told me that she is having a hard time reconciling how she feels towards me with the shit I pulled and the good times.  I have tried to hope for things to get better but its so hard to do that. Right now I have none I don't see this getting better even if I do everything right, which I have serious doubts about my ability.\n\nI hate that I ignored and avoided for so long that I drove her to this point what kinds of piece of shit does that to a person they claim to love! I have seriously thought that my presence in their lives does more damage than anything else at this point. Why should I drag this out when it seems she thinks I am no good for her and will likely ask for a divorce. If this is not a statement that I am no good for people I don't know what is.   \n  \nMy thought is I will kill myself then insist that she has whatever good man she marries after me fully adopt my kids, name change and all. I would leave letters acknowledging how this will hurt them and encourage them to think of the new man as their real father and husband and that I was pretend or something. I would explain that my presence in their lives would have led to more pain more suffering. Now at least they don't have to shuttle back and forth and live two lives. I think I refuse to make my children live a life where they have to bounce around and life is unstable due to a bastard who couldn't get his shit together soon enough to truly love their mother. \n\nWhy? Why should I even consider staying alive with this bleak and damning picture?   \n  \nI don't really need responses (but maybe this is the manipulative asshole in me who is trying to get people to say nice things about me or maybe it is the hope coming in that people think I have worth, I just needed to write this out and put it somewhere to be read and be semi anonymous.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1moj5ti/i_cause_more_pain_in_my_family_than_i_should_and/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1moj5ti/i_cause_more_pain_in_my_family_than_i_should_and/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

As quickly as possible after such a thought arises, I redirect my thoughts away from that scene, towards fantasies about an adult character instead, but I feel lingering shame and self disgust for the rest of the day after that.\n\nI feel like I don't belong in human society if I am attracted to a character that most people would find it morally unacceptable to be attracted to. I feel like if most people knew I had these feelings, they would want nothing to do with me any more, which means they never really liked me in the first place. I feel it is unacceptable for someone who has the feelings I have to exist.\n\nI asked about this on [r/sex](/r/sex/) and the replies so far have confirmed my fears that most people would think I'm horrid: [https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1mh21c5/cw\\_disturbing\\_topic\\_is\\_what\\_im\\_feeling\\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1mh21c5/cw_disturbing_topic_is_what_im_feeling_real/)\n\nI have talked to multiple clinical psychologists and psychiatrists about this, and they have all said that it can't be changed, and that they think I should accept it instead of fighting it.\n\nI think therapists tend to have an ideology of radical acceptance, of \"if it's not hurting anyone you should accept it\", and I don't agree with that in this case. I guess therapists tend to be desensitised because they've already heard worse.\n\nIt does appear according to the best modern science at the moment that there isn't any way to change what someone is attracted to. You can either encourage them to focus on other focuses of attraction that are less problematic, which doesn't make the unwanted attraction go away, it just reduces the likelihood of acting on it. Or they can undergo chemical castration which reduces their libido completely to zero, so that they never experience any asexual feelings or fantasies - however it is considered unethical by psychiatrists to use this on anyone who isn't a risk to real people or animals (I have already asked them to try it and they said no).\n\nAt this point, I think unaliving myself might be the only option to make these feelings go away completely.\n\nI have been in talk therapy for 14 years at this point, I see a therapist every fortnight, it doesn't help.", "score": 14, "num_comments": 14, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1mh4xsk/want_to_die_bc_its_the_only_way_to_get_rid_of_my/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1mh4xsk/want_to_die_bc_its_the_only_way_to_get_rid_of_my/", "over_18": true, "removed_by_category": null}

Now with the new responsibilities I see in real time how my own short comings affect people's lives and I can't take it, I thought I was a normal guy, I thought I was sane and able to accept that my actions affect other but apparentfuckingly not.

I fuck everything up, from friendships to jobs, and I know no amount of apologizing will fix this. I just don't know what will. And if I can't do this simple small family owned sports job right, what'll happen when I get a \"real\" job? When my mistakes affect not 4 or 5 people, but hundreds? maybe thousands? If I can't coordinate highschoolers and retirees, people settled at the moment in their lives, how the fuck will I be able to help run a company of people growing a family and in the process of building a home? People who aren't settled? Why should I even try, it'll just make more problems, more reasons to hate myself. It's easier to just stop now and give up than it is to \"grow\" into a job befitting of me, but if I do, then that'll hurt those who love me, of which I don't deserve. I'm just. Sorry. To everyone, for everything, and if I could fix myself to make you happier may God please tell you that I would. I don't want to be a martyr or some pathetic whimp, I just want to help.

Im an annoyance, and inconvience to even my self. The worst part is, I'm told to believe that God wants to \"save my flesh\", ugh! That's not a blessing, thats a punishmnet! To want to keep me LIKE THIS! \n\nSo you could understand a bit of my point of view: pretend you are staring at a chunky old lady. You might say she deserves the beauty pagent crown, BUT deep inside of you...theres a part in your brain that's says \"I'm only saying that to make her feel worthy\" because deep inside of you, you KNOW she doesnt deserve to uphold the title of \"most beautiful\" because you KNOW that she is NOT. Even your brain agrees that she is NOT deserving of such a crown and title. Well, use this analogy and think \"why would you give the crown of life (heaven) to a person like ME (hideous inside and out). Its line putting lipstick on a pig. It makes me feel humiliated, not rewarded! Because as long as i have to keep looking the way i do and exist as me (even if looked different from i look like now), the REAL me will always be STAINED by hideousness! Because the real me was BORN that way. Giving me heavenly surgery to change my apparently I'm heaven is FAKE, as fake as cosmetic surgery. Underneath all that, I will always be inferior and hideous and worthless, thats the real me beaneath all that \"surgery\" made in heaven or on earth. Thats why I'd rather just cease to exist. I feel hopeless. I would hope atheists are right when they say theres no consciousness ever again. To me, that is my reward that I desire even if I also feel like I dont even deserve it either.\n\nIm more depressed right now too, because I gained a few pounds and I'm finally at a normal BMI though still on the lower side. It makes me depressed to go from underweight to normal weight, because it makes me look fat and like a woman. I dont want to look like one, it doesn't match who I feel like I am on the inside. I feel humiliated, disgusted, angry. It also makes me look like a butter face, so my body just serves to highlight all the negative about my face. I dont want it! I wanna die....I dont know what I've done to deseve this humilation. My parents think I'm humble, but if they only that my zero sense of self worth is why I never take pride in anything I do or receive. They also think I have a bad spirit everytime I say I'm male on the inside, nut the only reason I say I am a male is because nothing about me is authentically female. Sure, my biology is female, but my body does nor define what I am as a person. You cant tell if I'm mean, nice, evil selfish based on how I LOOK. Yet, I'm judged as all those things solely based on how I look. Im rejected becauae of how i look. Therefore, ive decided to also join in on this bandwagon ans reject my biology (looks). To me, my body and face are dead. They are irrelevant, they are just a meat sack that in imprisoned in. I will feel free when I'm away from this humiliation! When I'm dead and gone! I have sooo much anxiety, I cant take it anymore. The only thing this body is good for is to oppress me and make me suffer.

I’ve also seen first hand men checking out women or being flirtatious. I have never experienced this for myself.\n\nI’ve been asked out 3 times in my life, the third time *was* by my fiancé. But I’ve been rejected by just as many and I’ve attempted to flirt with many more. My fiancé now knows all of this and he compliments me all the time and is obvious when he checks me out on purpose. \n\nHe does also sometimes notice other women when we’re out together and it triggers that feeling of never being noticed by men because I always hoped that my partner would finally be someone who would find me so attractive that they didn’t care what anyone else looked like. We’ve talked about this at length, and I’ve admitted to the ways it’s unreasonable and he’s admitted to having unhealthy views in the past. \n\nHe also sometimes tries to hype me up by making comments about how other guys are going to notice me.

I am a 29 year old man and have, at least for the last month or so, been dealing with a huge downward spiral in regards to how I see myself. I've always had these kinds of issues, to the point that I will usually kinda write to myself about how terrible I am and all the reasons the people around me would be better off if I just left them alone, hid in my room and never interacted with any of them ever again. I feel like I'm just kind of tired of always keeping it so private but I know that if I ever told someone half the things I say to myself with the frequency that I do, they might worry and then I'd just have one more thing to add to the list, that I had manipulated someone into feeling sorry for me.\n\nI feel like, for now, the thing that is killing me is that I can only see myself as this ugly, repulsive slug of a human being both inside and out. I have all of these friends that I really only met in the past year but it has honestly been such a gift getting to learn about and become a part of their lives. Unfortunately I do not think I am the kind of person who has ever deserved a gift in his life and quite honestly, after every time we hang out, all I can think of are the negatives and all of the reasons that they might choose to no longer want me around. I am loud, I am annoying, I think I impose myself on them and force myself into situations and gatherings that they just wish I would stay out of. Every interaction that I can scrutinize, I will.\n\nI feel like I push myself onto my friends in the most disgusting ways that feel perfectly fine for everyone else but just....disgusting when I do it. For instance, these friends of mine are all very physically affectionate. There is a lot of kissing and hugging and all sorts of physical showing of affection. The problem is, I feel like every time I kiss someone, they are only accepting or asking out of pity. Kinda like, \"Oh well, that guy's super lonely. We should humor him so he doesn't hurt himself or drink too much.\" Then they try to tell me that I'm not actually ugly or gross but all I can think about is how nobody would tell their friend that they're disgusting. It feels rude, so they are probably just saying it to make me feel better, and then I start spiraling again cause oh my god, I'm literally just some disgusting mouth-breather clinging onto the only people I have ever met willing to stomach my presence enough to get that close to me and it's vile and manipulative but in my brain I also know the alternative is to just hide in my room and never talk to anyone which i know is probably the right thing to do in this situation but it's just so ACTUALLY lonely living like that.\n\nAll I can do is just sit up and wonder how much longer they can realistically put up with me being around them, and I am scared that I won't be ready for it when it happens. I don't want to be on my own, even though I know I deserve it and thinking about it just hurts but like, what else am I supposed to do? If I don't mentally prepare then it's just gonna hit me even harder and I'll only be more devastated to hear them FINALLY stating the obvious that yeah, I am disgusting and repulsive to be around. They never liked having me around and the only reason I've even lasted a year with all of them is because I am manipulative and guilted everyone into treating me nicely. I just can't stop thinking \"they didn't actually want that\" every time I do anything with anyone and it feels so retroactively vile that I keep on just agreeing to do things I fully disbelieve any human being in their right mind would ever want to do with me in the first place.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1luc9zk/any_form_of_affection_from_me_feels_like_im_just/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1luc9zk/any_form_of_affection_from_me_feels_like_im_just/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

To be told these things.", "selftext": "I feel such disgust....my mother doesn't know, but she thinks I'm \"triggered\" by mirrors and that that's why I stay staring for a little and with a sad countenance on my face. If she only knew what I burry under all this, the feelings that have sent me to the grave. I \"died\" years ago beaneath all of that, shes only seeing the surface. Sure, maybe mirrors do trigger me a bit, they get me moodier because it reminds me of how ugly I am. Today, I was caught staring at my reflection on my window, but I didn't even realize I was doing this because I zoned out. I was talking with my mother, and suddenly I sorta lost my focus because I caught a glimpse of my face, which was enough to \"stun me\" emotionally, like it just broke me in that moment, so much in accidentally stopped talking and I frowned without realizing it. Like, imagine having a great time laughing with someone but then you see your face quickly and suddenly, you're unhappy now, no more laughing. It kills your mood, you know? \n\n\nI must be worst than I think though, because I can't see the severity of how ugly and weird looking I am apparently. I see the weird and the ugly, but I can't see the severity of as many do. Here are the comments I have received in real life (no exaggerations being made here, I've for real, been told these things, most of them said right in front of my face as I wasn't standing there). Among these comments, some of my inner thoughts on them. \n\n\nLook at his sister (me). *guy's friend turns to stare at me with a serious face, not even laughing (almost disturbed looking).\n\nDo you think she (let's call me \"Sarah\") is hot? I didn't even care if it was about me or not, and my classmates just had to reassure me that they weren't talking about me, that it was a different Sarah that use to go to class with them the prior year (I believe them, I remember her). Its always us ugliest who have to be reassured that they arent attracted us, because normal people feel disgust at the idea of us believing they are attracted to us.\n\nDifferent classmate told another classmate \"she's ugly, and SoooooOooo weird!\"\n\nAlways being reminded bow weird I was, but never being told why....\n\nUntil it hit me one day thanks to a rude person in public. So in my teenage years, some guy gave me that same serious face, a complete stranger. This guy was with his brother I believe, and I was at best buy. He stayed staring at me and I tried staying positive, and for a moment I thought \"This makes me uncomfortable, but I'll try being positive, maybe this guy finds me slightly attractive?\" I felt hurt, because I really thought, being hopeful, that perhaps my \"beauty\" was being appreciated for once. I knew I wasn't attractive, never have been, but I thought \"well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, maybe for once somebody thinks different of me, maybe they like sorta ugly girls like me?\"\n\n— Man who was i kidding...while it's true beauty can be subjective, facial harmony being attractive is scientifically objective. Evolution makes us subconsciously scan for facial harmony because anything outside of that can translate as possible disease. This is to weed out weak genetics and weak offspring thus. This guy i mentioned, who was staring at me— i just turned my eyes sideways to look to the side instead and just smiled a little as if saying to him \"um, awkward?\" To signal at him that his staring was making me uncomfortable, but also with a polite closed smile\". He didnt stop staring...he looked really taken a back with his dead eyes stare, like lifeless and emotionless, and then he said in a sort loud voice to his brother \"she....lOooks sOooooooo.... WeeeiRD!\" Thats right, read it you guys, with that much EMOTION and drama put into those words. Thats how much emphasis he put into his comment, and he didnt even laugh.  His brother turned quickly to look at me, and his mouth opened a little and he didn't stare for long, but he stared, making it obvious then that I was weird enough to keep him staring for more than a second. But he was concentrated on his video games, he sorta ignored it after. I felt hurt, because for a moment, i believed it...i believed he was appreciating a beauty I didnt have. I reallt diddnt see such a comment coming, because i was unaware of how BAD i trult look, and that hurt. Plus, i was so excited this day, because i was among the first to get a royal blue ninentendo DS. My joy was crushed and turned into tears instead. I had never had a DS, and it was for sale that day. And after all my struggles in life, and surviving many near death close calls after battling life health problems, i wanted some joy in my life, just to be taken away in seconds. I was in bodily pain that day by the way, hidden behind a small smile putnon with a great deal of effort. I hadnt been out for many years, just to be met with these comments. I guess i dont desrve a break in life...at least thanks to that guy, I figured out why I was called weird and avoided like the plague no matter how I acted.  I despise being a female even more than ever now. Not only due to biological disadvantages and things that run in my family on the female side that I inherited, but also because (and i mean no insult) I dont like the way women look. I'm sorry, I just dont embrace it. I feel weird being a female, even more so when I'm being told I look like some alien creature instead of a normal female at least. \n\n\nAnd there's many other comments too, like the girl who looked at me quickly while she was in the vet's waiting room. How did she even see me? Apparently I'm so weird looking, that upon entering the room (through the entrance door which was on her left side) I caught her full attention from her peripheral vision. Thats how weird i am, so weird she noticed me from her peripheral vision, so she turned her head all the way and jumped up her seat. She straightened herself as if she wouldve been shocked or hit by something. Then she turned to her mom super fast and told her \"she looks weeeirdd\" and her mom didnt even look at her daughter, she just pretends not to hear her comment but she whispered through her teeth \"I know\".\n\nI'm treated like a freak show. I'm a Christian and apparently I'm told based on the Bible, that God is real, that the people in heaven and the holy angels are the audience of the Christians, (meaning we are all being STARED at) and that God really wants to keep me with this face forever when I join their preseneces in heaven to live forver and ever! Im sorry, but this made me feel much worse! Did I mention, just because they're christians doesnt mean I'm welcomed? Yep, even other Christians judge me based on my face and height. And to think I'd spend an eternity looking the way I do with these people, forever!\n\nI feel so ashamed, not because of what they say, but because I always knew it was true, that I was the odd ball out. Even in first grade, when I had at least a big group of friends, their \"boyfriend\" they were all dating, said he liked everyone execpt me. I was only 6 years old, he was 8.\n\n\nI feel like i get people in a bad mood because of my face too. Like, I noticed the only time I'm treated better is when people are having a blast with their best friends or with loved ones. Like my dad for example. He doesnt hate me, but i always noticed there was embarssament involved with me. Theres a chance im autistic, so it may explain why i was sometimes sociallt dumb a bit, and coulsnt catch on with the \"uspoken and unwritten rules of society\". One day, i was standing all happily near my dad and I happen to make a comment to one of our family members, thinking I was welcomed. To my dismay, a few seconds after they leave, the smile quickly wipes off my dad's face (signifying that he was suppressing what he wanted to tell me all that time i guess) since as soon as that smile wiped off his face, he told me basically not to get into adult's conversations because adults could end up shoving me aside. But this isn't the first time I'm put to the side \"out of concern\". They're just masking what they actually feel towards me. My mom admitted she feels anxiety around me, and other things like my mother losing her patience with me when i was crying as well as my dad. Something as small as a \"oo im excited about this\" was enough to trigger an angry reaction. A simple waving to a classmate to. I wasn't standing to close or anything BTW. My cousins admitted im hideous and aboid me. My little sister acts the exact same way, if not, worst (I'm an adult now) and she has never gotten treated like that. She has tons of friends and is always reminded how cute and pretty she is and gets tons of free gifts. My cousins love her. I dont plan on going to her graduation ever, i don't want to embarass her.\n\nI feel awful about sooo many things. I recently felt bad too, because, long story short, I've been told I have a manipulating demon basically and ive been compared to one! I have meltdowns sometimes over childhood traumas and basically I get blamed and called a manipulator and that how i react is fucking choice. Yet, the same people say i have something evil controlling me but then also say im at fault for being this way. Cant believe something supposedly evil is more defended by christians than ME. I guess im that unworthy....so unworthy that God even wont take it away so that im no longer \"evil\". Apparently, I've been told that's why bad things happen to me, yet my life is a \"gift\".\n\n\nIm always accused of things, like envy and stuff, when i havent even said anything to come off as envious....As a Christian, not sure what to think of all this, but sometimes I just hate myself so much, that I wish that that \"demon\" they say it's have would just shut their mouths and mine (but mine) by strangling me with its own claws. Too bad it isn't like that now, is it? Sometimes i wish these people were right, because it would hurt less to be told \"the truth\" than to be accused of something im not. If I want death I'm gonna have to do it by myself anyway, no evil being is gonna come strangle me to death evidently. \n\n\nHow bad am I really then? That bad....so bad that im everything im accused of. I decided to take one long look in the mirror (especially after somebody told me to). And now, I feel dirty in my own skin. I get anxiety feeling the skin hanging off my bones, especially when I feel my bones rub against my skin, the bones under my arms's skin which covers my bones because i feel as if my bones are too \"pure\" to be rubbing against this disgusting ugly skin of mine. At least maybe my bones are pretty....since underneath all of this disgusting ugly skin, i look normal like everyone else. Yet, i feel like my bones are too \"pretty and pure\" to be rubbing against the muscle above it. This is why i constantly stare the mirror, and think and think. This is why i say i wish i could rip my face off or at least weight until im anorexic despite being thin already, my bones are the only pretty thing, and everything else laying on top of it is just so ugly...The less of me there is, the more ugly I have off of me. This is why being down to the bone is great...but being dead is better...or more like the best state of being for me. By then (by the time im burried under the earth) not only is my face gone, my bones are the only thing showing in the coffin, yet a coffin hidden away from the world, where no one can see me anymore.\n\nI feel disgust and grief feeling my bones on the sides of my pelvis bones sticking out and swaying slightly side to side as I feel my bones coming in contact with the surrounding muscle and healthy fat. I feel like such a faker, like im trying to look \"pretty\" walking when im not...all because a woman's pelvis makes her look like shes walking \"gracefully\". So apparently, this healthy estrogen fat us women have in different places to make us look womanly makes me feel disgusting, even more so when i feel my breasts scratching against my blouses when I wear them. Perhaps id be slightly more accepting of beinf a female if it werent for how ridiculously strange i look. I feel like ugly women (if they are a butter face) look worst than butter face men in comparsion, because of the woman's figure that just stands out way too much. She can't help if she was born that way (wide pelvis, big breasts). Meanwhile, at least a butter face guy doesn't \"have to\" be muscular/built or have womanly breasts, most of them aren't born looking built, so AT LEAST they may have body and facial harmony (skinny on face and body/plain face plain body). \n\n\nButter face in my opinion, is the worst thing anyone can be in my opinion though, whether female or male. I could feel the shape of my breasts all day long, i could feek if they gain weigh too and this makes me feel like im bigger and thus uglier. I could also at the same time, feel the wrinkling of my chin because of the damage it has (it's slightly receded but mostly has mentalist strain, basically muscle issue causing it too look like tons of dimples strangely). It hurts and burns my face. So basically, I could feel how butter faced I am, and it's humiliating. I feel filthy, worse than a clown show, like a freak show, and I feel restless all at once. I can't have fun ever, without feeling this way, so it kills my mood. I'm always enraged, upset, $uicidal. I hardly eat from stressed I am. And honestly? This feeling feels worse than starving. If i had to starve for days or feel the way I do now, I'd rather starve, because nothing hurts as much as my soul does...I feel like \"my soul\" is burning. I can't stand carrying this filthy sack of ugly meat, it's like carrying a poster sign that says \"dunce\", it humiliating and i cant do this every day. I cry when i eat, because eating is also a form of caring for yourself and loving your self. I feel weird...caring for myself, because I associate care with love, and I dont feel deserving of that. The only way to counterbalance this is by not eating. But sometimes, I'm sooo hungry, I feeling like just binging on a bit of everything but then $uiciding like Cassie from Skins does. She captures perfectly a portion of how I feel before dying (when she is looking at other people on the bus eating and when she eats her \"last meal\" a burger). \n\nThere's just so much in could say, as you could see, and this only 1/25th of a day's worth of suffering! Been suffering of other things for years (like medical physical illnesses), tons of pressure, nothing has gotten better. I hope when i age and die from old age, actually...I hope of die young, I dont want to know more pain. I also hope somebody steals my b0dy and destroys it. Wouldn't mind if somebody committed necr0philia, coz I I dont see this disgusting meat sack as mine.

This also takes a big toll on my mental health as it will be a constant battle for life. That’s why I go through binge restrict cycles. I also project that, so that is why I focus on big people.

I also know i clear my throat a lot because it’s like a nervous tick because I am uncomfortable/at unease. “Never truly relaxed”. I don’t feel like I’m a good person. Im never satisfied with myself. I suppose I also project insecurities outward in my words. I also found it odd that someone would want me or find me attractive. I feel like it’s odd.

As an audience, we'd all naturally notice the ugly person stand out upon entering the room, it's come natural to simply stare in a bit of shock and stare...and stare...and stare, until we realizing we are staring way too long as them (rude), so then we'd probably stop staring, but too late by then, we already did stare and the ugly person noticed.

You'd be shocked seeing someone so ugly come to sit at the table with you with so much confidence because while they may accept themsleves...you don't ... if you were a pretty person, you'd be like \"wtf is this guy/girl thinking? Sitting with us?\" You'd be so disgusted and shocked at \"the nerve\" they have. Because it turns out, even though this reaction is such a b*tchy reaction, it's completely natural and the default due to evolution making us subconsciously scan for facial harmony to avoid disease associated with non harmonious facial features (usually unattractive ones). So it turns out again, that us ugly people are the abnormal ones. \n\n\nNow let that sink in deep, WE are the abnormal ones here, not them. You can fully grasp this true statment upon vividly imagining yourself as one of the pretty people and looking from inside out. Imagine you are a part of their circle and you see someone like you come sit with you. We ugly people are the outsiders, who try to come fit within their circle. There's a sense of familiarity and acceptance within among each other, within that pretty group, so when a face that throws them off comes and joins them, it throes their brains off. Simply put, we weren't born lucky enough to be one of the normal people. Our connections with other people will most of the time, ever only be at a surface level. It takes emotionally intelligent people with a deep level if insight to accept us, but even then, notice how they have to work against their natural \"evil nature\" that evolution imposed on them which makes them reject us subconsciously. This is something normal people will never understand, therfore they gaslight you and say it's all in your imagination and that you are over reading into things. Just ask people who use to be pretty where they are in life now that they're considered ugly and they'll validate our experience. But the cycle repeats itself, no one believes them because as long as the people they are telling this to are decent looking, they won't see it, they cant...they can't see that what we say is true until it happens to them, where they become ugly (if they ever do). But then when these people finally believe, and go tell other people, they won't be believed.\n\n\nNow I totally get why the guy in Vegas said I looked so weird and strange without even hesitating. Can't blame him honestly. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, we are the runt of the litter. We will be lucky enough to receive the crumbs.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1lddvaf/something_sad_i_realized_about_us_ugly_people/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1lddvaf/something_sad_i_realized_about_us_ugly_people/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Let me explain, I failed my public communications class and I was afraid to tell my mother when I found out because she wanted me to do well in college, I didn't want to disappoint her. I never want to. This is the first time I have failed a class and today she found out after I think 2 weeks after my final grades came up. She was furious and took all my electronics away, for me this makes me feel lonely because I only have online friends, I have tried making ones in person but they never last long and end up going away or just cutting me off.. Anyway, I explained to her how scared I was but she just focused on how I didn't tell her and how come I lied when i said I was fine durning the 6 months I had college. I felt horrible and now I feel like a huge failiure because I was too afraid to tell her the truth, reason being is because when I do she always gets upset even when she says she won't, my reasoning for not telling her I was struggling was becasue years ago in 2015 I had a step dad that was an alcoholic, I asked him for help with math and everytime I did sommething wrong he would hit the table, yell, and call me names because I didn't understand. From that point on I have been scared of asking for help from anyone close to me, especially my mother, she's already a naturally loud person and that scares me quite often, it's not her intetion but when she gets mad I become frightened of her. I feel like I'm an annoyance to her in some way, I have always felt that way, I'm just too scared to tell her. I'm sorry for ranting but going back to now, I failed a class and now I'm paying for it, I don't feel like I should be here anymore, I feel so useless, I don't think I have a purpose, I can't do anything right at all in my life, all I do is make her mad and try to make her proud of me or happy but I can't do that.

(srry if this isn't the space)\n\nCW: dysphoria, emotional repression, sexuality tension\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\### \\*\\*Ratchet of days passing\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThe morning light creeps in through the drawn curtains of Oen’s room, casting everything in muted tones of gray and amber. His alarm buzzes at 8:30 a.m., but Oen doesn’t get up right away. He has an hour before his first lecture, and he knows he won’t make it in time if he doesn’t hurry. But he also knows the ritual. The mundane and comforting slow crawl from bed to the desk, from desk to shower, and then, inevitably, to the uniform of academia.\n\n\n\nThe uniform is simple: black sweatpants, a long-sleeve shirt that reads \\*“Overloaded”\\* in small, text-only font. A fitting metaphor, Oen thinks, for his entire existence. The morning is a necessary routine, and he has perfected it, knowing that his day will be follow the same clockwork as the rest.\n\n\n\nUni is a place of brief encounters and short, polite conversations. Oen drifts through the campus, earbuds in; usually something electronic and atmospheric. He says hello to his peers with a quick handshake. Nothing too personal, nothing too intrusive. Anything more just makes him feel worse.\n\n\n\nMike, who gives him a lift to campus, talks about Apex, football, the planes overhead. Casual, insubstantial topics. Oen nods, asking questions, vibing, but hearing how flat his responses sound and not really \\*connecting\\*. His mind drifts.\n\n\n\nLater, after lectures, Oen settles in his room after locking the door, a space where he can let go. His sanctuary. It’s dim and quiet, with everything in its place. Two monitors. Neatly stacked books. A tangle of cords on the floor that Oen pretends to ignore. Here, in this room, he can \\*be\\*.\n\n\n\nMike sends him a video. An improv comedy bit, ridiculous and absurd, two men pretending to be jazz-singing pigeons. Oen clicks the link without much thought, more out of habit than expectation. But then, against his better judgment, he starts laughing; deeply, genuinely, the kind of laughter that feels like it’s been locked away for too long.\n\n\n\nHe laughs at the absurdity of it, at the brazen stupidity of the entire thing. Oen responds in kind, sending a Tumblr meme about serotonin and the void. It’s a small exchange, but it’s something. Something real in a sea of empty distractions. For a brief moment, Oen feels the weight of his own humanity again.\n\n\n\nBy nightfall, Oen has fallen into his familiar pattern. Long hours of YouTube, scrolling through videos that don’t really interest him but fill the space. He’s exhausted his queue. His brain feels like static.\n\n\n\nThe quiet begins again, gnawing at the edges of his thoughts. The emptiness that he’s learned to live with. The flickering of his own self-doubt. And in the quiet, something stirs; a feeling, a need. It doesn’t make sense, but it’s there, insistent. Something about the sensation, the soft fabric against his skin. A kind of surrender that he can’t quite name.\n\n\n\nThe urge returns, almost like a compulsion. He feels \\*wrong\\*, but it’s a familiar kind of wrong. His inner tension tightens. He resists. But he's never been able to overcome it.\n\n\n\nThe skirt, the thigh-high socks. They go on like a second skin. The fabric feels \\*right\\*, almost too right. The gentle, soft caress against his legs feels like a contradiction: exposed yet contained, vulnerable but in control.\n\n\n\nHe curls up on the carpet, feeling the fibers press into his skin, the softness wrapping around him like a shield. He moves, shifts his legs, flexes his arms. Every motion, a small act of abandon against a world that doesn’t make sense to him. Pretending not to be alone.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the knock is jarring. A terrifying intrusion into his carefully curated world. He freezes. His breath catches in his throat. Panic rises.\n\n\n\nHis heart races. His chest constricts. \\*Shit.\\* His hands tremble as he scrambles to adjust himself. His breath hitches as he chokes out a quiet, forced “Yes?” His voice cracks, barely audible.\n\n\n\n“Hey,” his sister’s voice floats through the door, light and casual, completely unaware of the chaos inside. “We’re going to that ice cream place tomorrow. The one with the weird waffle cones? Mom says you should come.”\n\n\n\nHis sister doesn’t push. Just a soft “You don’t have to. Just saying. Night.”\n\n\n\nHer footsteps fade. She’s gone, leaving only the lingering quiet.\n\n\n\nOen exhales, slowly, but it’s not enough. His stomach churns, and he curls into himself. For a long moment, he doesn’t know what to do with himself. His hands clench. His teeth grind together. He curls into a tight ball on the floor, the soft fabric of the skirt still hugging his legs like a constant reminder. His breath comes in shallow, uneven gasps.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in the stillness, the rage rises, a quiet fire in his chest. It’s the kind that simmers beneath the skin, making him tremble, making his body feel small and wrong.\n\n\n\n\\*What the fuck am I?\\* he whispers the seething question through burning tears.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nOen wakes up. He’s not sure when he fell asleep, but the sharp, uncomfortable pressure in his lower back tells him it must’ve been late. He’s still on the carpet.\n\n\n\nThe skirt. He still has it on.\n\n\n\nIt feels wrong now, like something he’s been trapped inside all night. He shivers, feeling the soft fabric of the skirt against his skin. \\*Exposed\\*, \\*unseen\\*, \\*too much\\*. The sensation is almost sensual, the way it moves against his body, but it’s not right. Not when the world is supposed to be full of clean lines and presentable interactions.\n\n\n\nDaytime Oen takes over wordlessly.\n\n\n\nHe gets up slowly, body aching. He slips into the black sweatpants, the long-sleeve shirt. The nylon jacket.\n\n\n\nIn the mirror, he sees the reflection of the version of him that fits in the world. Tired, distant, but ready.\n\n\n\n\\*Ice cream,\\* he thinks absently, staring at his phone. They told him about it in advance this time. He smiles, just barely.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nOen had nearly forgotten about the outfit. Until today.\n\n\n\nIt had been a long time since that night — the sleepover at a distant family friend, a long time since they'd spent hours gaming on the floor, watching the stars, painting.\n\n\n\nHer name was Ally, and she’d been one of the few people in his life he could talk to without feeling like he was putting on a performance. She was funny, quick-witted, and completely unbothered by the typical small-town clichés. But the question she asked him that night still lingered in the back of his mind, unanswered, like a question he didn’t dare explore:\n\n\n\n“Do you ever think about wearing skirts?”\n\n\n\nIt had been one of those offhanded comments, something thrown into a conversation as casually as she might talk about her favorite bands or the latest episode of a TV show. But it had caught him off guard. His brain had stuttered for a moment, uncertain how to respond. There had been a flicker of warmth in his chest, a tightening at the base of his throat. The feeling was both new and familiar, like a secret that he hadn’t yet discovered about himself, but that she already seemed to understand.\n\n\n\nHe’d laughed it off, his voice betraying his unease. “In fantasies,” he said, knowing it wasn’t the full truth but not ready to dive deeper.\n\n\n\nShe had smiled, like she wasn’t surprised.\n\n\n\nThe evening passed, and they played more games, drank a little too much soda. But when the night wound down and the others were asleep, it was just the two of them in her room. She had seemed to hesitate, then spoke softly, carefully.\n\n\n\n“If you ever want to try it,” she said, pulling a soft fabric from a drawer, “you can wear something of mine. I have some skirts you can borrow. No pressure, though. It’s up to you.”\n\n\n\nOen didn’t know what to say. He had always known Ally was open about her bisexuality, but he hadn’t expected this. Was she offering him an invitation? A safe place? Or was it just an act of kindness, the way one might offer a friend something they no longer needed?\n\n\n\nHe had agreed, though. Too quickly, almost. It wasn’t that he wanted to cross some line with her; it was that the idea of wearing something that made him feel differently, something that challenged him, felt right in a way he couldn’t explain.\n\n\n\nShe left him in her room. The fabric was soft, delicate against his skin, and as the skirt settled into place, something inside Oen shifted.\n\n\n\nThe sensation of it was overwhelming. The way the soft cloth clung to his legs, the way it felt like a second skin, not quite feminine but not entirely neutral either. The contrast between his sweatpants, his usual uniform, and the fabric of the skirt was jarring, but in a way he couldn’t look away from. He felt exposed. Vulnerable. But also… alive. There was a strange, carnal pull to it; one that unsettled him, that made his heart race. His body reacted in a way that both surprised and frightened him.\n\n\n\nHe could feel his breath quicken. The rush of shame. The rush of something else. His body was betraying him, reacting to the simple fabric in a way he couldn’t control.\n\n\n\nHe’d turned to face her aftwards, his hands trembling. “I’m sorry,” he’d muttered, feeling the weight of his own reaction. “I didn’t mean to-”\n\n\n\nHer voice was soft, unbothered. “You didn’t do anything wrong, Oen. It’s okay. Just… if you ever want to try again, you can keep them. I don’t mind.”\n\n\n\nShe didn’t ask questions, didn’t push him for anything. She just gave him the space to feel whatever he needed to feel, without judgment. At least not from her.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nPresent Day:\n\n\n\nNow, as Oen sits on the floor of his room again, the skirt draped across his legs, the memory feels distant, almost unreal.\n\n\n\nHis fingers tremble against the soft fabric, the same fabric that Ally had let him borrow all those years ago. The same feeling of tension, discomfort, and, now, guilt rises again.\n\n\n\nWhy did I accept it back then? he thinks. Why do I still have it?\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t supposed to feel like this; like something so visceral, so tied to his own sense of self and the contradictions within it.\n\n\n\nThey haven’t been the same since.\n\n\n\nHe still sees her at family gatherings, says hello. But he never brings it up. He can’t.\n\n\n\nShe gave him something without judgment, and he can’t stop associating it with a version of himself he loathes. That version ruined what they had. Not with words, not with action but with the truth of what he is when no one is watching.\n\n\n\nSo the wall remains. Not cold. Just… closed.\n\n\n\nShe doesn’t ask. He doesn’t tell.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nWhen he gives in again, when the loneliness becomes too much, the hunger too sharp, he queues the same ASMR file. A soft voice, feminine, gentle, whispering things he’ll never hear from a real person. Always a woman, he knows he's still straight, somehow that's a comfort.\n\n\n\n“You’re safe now…”\n\n\n\nHe pictures a girl beside him. Never someone he knows. Someone faceless but kind. She sits behind him on the floor and brushes his hair. Long, slow strokes. The voice matches the motion.\n\n\n\n“You look cute in this, you know?”\n\n\n\nIt’s a lie. But it’s a needed one.\n\n\n\nHe folds himself into the image. Her lap under his head. Fingers trailing down his arms. The illusion wraps around him like a blanket. In this fiction, he is allowed to be small. To be wanted. To be held.\n\n\n\nHe shudders. His body trembles.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nHe looks at what he’s done. Again.\n\n\n\nThe ASMR is still playing. Soft brushing sounds, gentle reassurances. They twist in his ears like mockery now.\n\n\n\nHis stomach turns. He strips the skirt off, casting it to the floor like it might burn him.\n\n\n\nHe curls inward, heart racing, throat tight. This isn't what I meant. This isn't who I am. And yet the evidence is right there.\n\n\n\nSo, like always, he retreats.\n\n\n\nThe mindscape forms, a desolate battlefield. His armored conscience appears, rigid and brutal, dragging metal stakes. The soft version of him stands in silence.\n\n\n\nNo resistance. No defense.\n\n\n\nOne stake through the shoulder. Another through the thigh. A third through the chest.\n\n\n\nStill no pain.\n\n\n\nHe waits for the guilt to fade. It never does. It only dulls, like an ache behind the ribs. Familiar. Tolerable.\n\n\n\nThe skirt is folded again, quietly, carefully. Returned to its place. He slips into the black sweatpants, long-sleeve shirt, and jacket.\n\n\n\nThe silence returns.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1kjk2co/losing_to_myself_a_narrative_exploration_of/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1kjk2co/losing_to_myself_a_narrative_exploration_of/", "over_18": true, "removed_by_category": null}

My self hate is so intense, I almost can’t live it it anymore, it’s almost suffocating. Does anyone relate?

I can't even take a compliment or a 'thank you' anymore ffs. \n\nI mean here's an example, my team won the state esports league, and we've been trying to do that since sophomore year. I should have been proud, 'cause I basically carried every week for the entire season to make us do that, but instead we won and I was happy for like 2 minutes and then I just felt empty all of a sudden. At the end of it there was supposed to be a pizza party, and I just skipped it. I don't know why, I just really felt like I didn't deserve to be there. \n\nMy friends asked why ofc, I just didn't really answer and they never brought it up again. I feel like they know I'm not always as happy when I'm not around them, but they see me finally doing a good job pretending I'm fine and they just go with it, for my sake. They're way too nice to me, I don't even know why they keep me around in the first place honestly. Sometimes I wonder if they'd miss me if I just stopped showing up. Honestly a lot of the time I think they'd just be happier that way. \n\nEarlier today even, I woke up at like 11:50, didn't sleep all that well I guess, and it's fine 'cause I didn't have to do anything anyways, but instead of just going with it, I got up, locked my door, sat down, and cried under my breath about how much of a lazy piece of shit I was for half an hour. Then I skipped lunch on purpose for it. \n\nI can't stay proud of myself for anything. I won't even start conversations because I think people just don't want to talk to me and I don't want to bother them. I don't let myself enjoy things anymore because I just feel guilty whenever I'm happy. I do whatever I can for other people because the only thing that makes me feel alright is just seeing other people happy, But then I get mad at myself when they try to acknowledge me for it, because I sure as fuck don't deserve thanks or praise for it. \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? The worst part is I thought I was past this shit like, 6 months ago. Anyways, if you read all that, uhhh.... thanks I guess? Sorry. Idk. I guess Good Luck getting past whatever you've got going on!

But ever since Covid, the lock down, I couldn’t force myself to be social anymore, I got used to being alone and I loved it. And now I’m more of the silent and awkward type, which isn’t that bad 🤷‍♂️. \n\nBut anyway, over the years I can’t hold down a job, I can’t deal with aholes…and I’ve come to learn that there are aholes everywhere. I can deal with a small interaction with one, but after a month or two of dealing with the same people I have a mental breakdown, an emotional outburst. This latest one has affected me so much that I haven’t been able to work for the past year. I’m not going into detail about what happened but it wasn’t targeted at me, this person was the head of my department and was an whole to everyone, but I’m much more sensitive than others it seems.\n\nAnd then me and my ex broke up so I moved back in with my mom, and then my best friend of 6 years ended the friendship. Long story short it was a shitty time, but I was slowly getting better over the months, and then for some reason a month or two ago I just started feeling 100 times worse, I am used to depressive episodes but this was worse than ever. I couldn’t leave bed, I couldn’t care less about personal hygiene (I’m normally pretty serious about it) I just couldn’t do anything.

I can’t do that to her again.\n\nBut now my moms started getting really angry. Saying she misses her son that was always happy, always laughing.

A waste of a life. \n\nShe did apologise after but god I don’t know how to get back to how I was, or if I can.

I hate how I’m an ungrateful little bitch and tried to kill myself without seeing the amount I’m fucking blessed in this world.\n\nMost of all I hate how I get hope, make promises, get motivated, only to crash and burn the next day, or the day after, or 3 weeks later, only to reflect and realize that I haven’t changed.\n\nI absolutely fucking hate myself.\n\nHonestly that’s ok. I’m ok with hating myself.

{"id": "1izeovg", "subreddit": "SelfHate", "created_utc": 1740659622, "author": "Winsome_Wolf", "title": "Graduated Magna Cum Laude on my 4yr degree, Yet Can't Manage to Hold a Job That Doesn't Even Require HS Diploma/GED.", "selftext": "Warning: This is something of a stream-of-consciousness rant that I have needed to get off my chest for weeks. Ive tried to make it make some kind of sense but I  make no promises. \n\nTL;DR: I have tried to do everything that I was told I was supposed to so to succeed in life, and in fact I was highly accomplished in that prep work, but ultimately failed at the actual task anyway. I feel defeated AF, and maybe the worst part is that I can't even admit defeat and submit terms of surrender, because even surrender means either living on the street, leaving myself in the meat grinder of continued failure, or leeching off of others.\n---\nSome context first: I live in the U.S. and while I don't buy into all its ultra capitalist bullshit, and constant messages that you're only worth how much money you make—or not worth anything at all, really, if you can't make money for other people—the hard reality is that while being unemployed may suck everywhere, here it is godsdamned DEADLY. Mostly because medical care here, and all basic necessities actually, are considered a privilege not a right. They're available... IF you can afford them. And our social safety nets, while never adequate in my lifetime, and usually brutally dehumanizing to access, are currently being hacked to a bloody mess by our new orange king and his favorite billionaire's goon squad. So I don't have a lot of faith that anything will catch me if I fall. That's the constant background noise in my head. Oh and just to make things extra anxiety producing, I'm trans non-binary in a now openly hostile country. My one saving grace on that note is that the local area I live in is somewhat less benighted. But it still adds to the anxious hum in my head because it absolutely limits where it is safe for me to go. \nAt present I'm holding on solely because my partner has a good job, but he has severe RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis, for thise that don't know; his case is so bad because they didn't correctly diagnose/treat him until 14 years after the fact), as well as a heart condition (caused largely by the too-long untreated RA), and I cannot tell you how much it hurts me to have to put all the pressure for our economic safety—which again, in the U.S., is safety, period—on him. That's too much to ask of one person who is already struggling themselves just to get their body to work with them. So I feel like shit for that as just a baseline state.\n\nNow about me: I am absolutely amazing at academics. I learn and assimilate fairly quickly to a high degree, and my synthesis skills are really excellent, but I cannot produce work that proves it at anywhere near the same speed. It took me 13 years to get Bachelor's Degree... something that's supposed to take only 4 years to do. (For those interested: It's in Philosophy and was damn near a double major with Math, but health problems prevented me from getting the last two classes I needed to complete that side.) The primary reason it took so long is that I have a double whammy of learning disabilities, namely Dysgraphia and ADHD (Hyperfocused type). The way I explain Dysgraphia to people is that my brain is on fiber optic broadband, but my hands are on dial-up (on a bad day, they are stuck with telegraph lines). So the \"network packet loss\" is pretty severe, and I have to work very slowly or I will skip letters, words, even entire sentences. And my hyperfocused ADHD makes the idea of multitasking so ludicrous that it would be comical if it wasn't so damning not to have that skill at this point in history. (Also I have anxiety and go rounds with depression, but I consider those perfectly reasonable and normal responses/conditions, since the world is on friggin fire and good news from any quarter is rare.)\n\nThing is, schools want you to succeed, so they support you in this if you come with disability documentation in hand. But jobs? Well, if you're too slow, they cut you loose pretty quick, ADA law be damned, they're just gonna say you can't do the work, and therefore you can be let go with no recourse. (Last job let me go within a couple weeks of my application for accommodations; their \"interactive prcocess\" never even got conpleted.) \n\nSo I tried...\n\n...mannual labor, my body can't hack it, maybe if I'd started and stuck with it at 20 I could manage, but at 40+ and out of shape, yeah no, not happening. Also overt sexism is alive and well in most of those areas so no thank you very much.\n\n...retail and not only do I hate it but my bosses seem to resent my intelligence. I dunno, maybe they think I'm gunning for their positions or something. That might be a problem in general, actually.\n\n...call center work, and apparently taking the time to actually help people instead of rushing them off the phone as fast as possible to keep metrics up is a no-no. Also listening to people who are in crisis because your employer screwed them over is really not good for mental health, especially when said employer doesn't want to be arsed to fix it or fixing it requires a ball of string, a torch, a sword, and listening for minotaur hooffalls.\n\n...going to trade school, once for auto body repair and once for IT certs, only to find out that most are for-profit scams: One school got shutdown  and sued for its malpractice and one of the certs I got became irrelevant a year later.\n\n...taking a bartending class, only to find out that to get hired as one, you really need to be a lot more traditionally physically attractive than I am if you are a the owner of certain anatomical features. \n\n... security guard work, and with this I had actually some moderate success, but the pay absolutely sucks, and is totally not worh the amount of hassle to get/maintain licensure in my state, or the amount of legal risk you personally take on. And employers are apt to be a little crazy? \n\n...Temp/seasonal work, hoping it would lead to something more permanent gainful, but it never is did.\n\n... applying for hundreds of office jobs, never even hearing back. If I do hear back, it's over 99% of the time a rejection. \n\n...applying for SSI/SSDI because my stress levels over this and related stuff have sent me in-patient 3 times. I was told I had no case by the most successful  SSI/SSDI law firm in the country.\n\nAnd then there's every job I don't apply fo because I'm constantly finding myself \"overqualified\" for basic entry level positions (the ones where using one's head for more than a hat rack gets one in trouble), and yet \"underqualified\" for anything else because they want X number of years experience and I don't have it.\n\nI'm considering going back to community college for a paralegal A.A.S degree, but I'm not sure I can afford it, and even if I can ... Will it actually amount to anything? I'm sure I'd particularly be good at assisting with research, once I learn how that works, but will they let me focus on that? I don't know. There's an internship that's a part of the degree, which could really help get my foot in the door, but there are of course no guarantees. But I thought maybe, if I actually had a more specialized skill than \"think gud\", just maybe it would give the less creative employers some semblance of a clue what I'm actually capable of. But I've, trained and retrained again and again, and none of it has ever led to gainful employment that I've been able to keep. So much for education being a \"silver bullet.\"\n\nThe upshot is that it sure seems to me that there is no place in the system for people like me. People who are great thinkers but can't become professional academics for whatever reason, and can't convince anyone else they'd be of use. And its getting increasingly difficult not to feel like I'm the whole problem. But I guess where the blame falls doesn't even matter, really, the practical reality is that I'm not safe because I cannot take care of myself. I also don't have that many more years of working left in me, so the idea of having a nest egg for when my body gives out is laughable. I can't even  handle the rent on my place now by myself, and my rent is astoundingly cheap and stable for what I have, compared to market averages. It was supposed to be a starter apartment for us... back in 2002. 23 years later, we're still here because we can't reasonably afford better without going back into the CC debt we spent 2 decades clawing our way out of. And that's all because I can't hold a job. I'M the reason we can't have nice things, and that feels pretty shitty. I've tried so many times to do better and each time I ultimately fail. \n\nI'm running out of resilience. Maybe I should just stay down, go pick my favorite cardboard box out of the closet, find an alley and take up residence there. That's my place, I think. That's where I keep being pushed, even as I'm praised for my mental faculties. And it's hard not to hate myself for that. I hate the system more, no question, but at the end of the day, my failure to launch is just that... my failure, complete with total ownership of the consequences.

I had dreams of one day accomplishing something good. I wanted to make my family proud.\n\nBut now, I've become the vilest being in existence. I hate myself, I wish I could tear apart this dark skin on mine. Everybody mocks me for it, nothing I do ever goes past my ugly appearance. I'm unfit, my mom said no one would want to marry you, last morning.\n\nI woke up and I realised, it was because I dared to look up and dream. I envy those who ignore everything and can be happy with little things.\n\nToday is Valentine's. I don't mind anything about it. But it reminds me of how my vile self would never be worthy of love. My face looks like God put all his failure into making me. I hate this world, it mocks me.\n\nI cried, I couldn't stop. I feel pathetic every day I wake up. My only redeeming quality was I was above average in school, it was the only thing I was recognised for.\n\nBut I've again realised my place. I was born like this, underneath others. Others are taller then me, they look at me with smirks knowing I was born unworthy. Others are fair, they smirk at me knowing I was made so that they could have something opposite of them. Something that showed why they were superior.\n\nI have no one I can talk to. How I wish I could sleep and never wake up. How I wish I could watch others like me. But they all have something to live for.\n\nI want to end it all. I am a disappointment.\n\nI have a twin. She made me happy. She talked to me and cared for me. But I'm alone now cuz she has someone she loves now. She never talks to me now.\n\nShe's worthy of love.\n\nIf I die today, I curse all of you. The world and the god who made me. Why? Why did it have to be me? Born to be the worst in everything.\n\nNo matter how hard I try, I fail. I cannot understand what I study. I cannot have a skin that needs constant covering cuz of how disgusting it is. No skin care works.\n\nI workout, but I'm so fat, everyone without working out looks better than me.\n\nWhy was I born? Was it just to suffer? I wish I'd never been born. I wish I could just vanish.\n\nI wish no one like me exists somewhere. Becuz living is a prison I was sent to cuz hell was not enough suffering. I wish someone tears me apart while laughing at my pathetic self.\n\nI wish my mom and dad killed me. I'm unworthy of life. I'll end it today. I cannot stop crying. Tears keep on coming out of me, they soak my disgusting black skin. My abominable apperance has become worse. I wish I had something to cling to or someone to talk to.\n\nSomeone I could laugh with. I feel so lonely, I wish I was never born.\n\nI hate god for creating me. Why didn't he pity me? Why did he let me be born. I wish I died as a foetus. Please, please, if there is god, never let someone like me live.\n\nI hate myself and I hate this world. I wish I could see the world burning and everyone feeling what I feel.

I just wanted to get this down someplace.\n \nI've been wondering recently if life was worth living. Things feel great when they feel great, and they feel bad when they feel bad, but I can't help but feel like things have always been bad, and I'm just fooling myself at times into thinking they're great.\n\nI don't really have much reason to think the way I do. I have loving and supportive parents with little issues in the family. I have close friends who I have spats with every now and then, but I can always make it up to them somehow.

I'm young, I know I'm thinking irrationally and I know this is probably just the product of one once in a while breakdown.\n\nBut I still can't get the feeling out of my mind. Is it death I'm afraid of? The pain? The fear of disappointment I'd bring to everyone I care about? I keep being told I think too much, I read into things too much and I assume too much. I'm told I'm frequently aggressive, and mad, and I have to wonder just why can't I ever notice it myself first? Is it pride? Is that what blinds me? \n\nWhy am I acting a victim when so often I end up hurting others? It doesn't make sense.\nAt this rate, I've felt like living was a more proper suited punishment, to face my mistakes and accept what comes at me then compared to running away and dying.\n\nI wanted to be a pharmacist someday. To help other people and see how I could do something good. Now I've started to worry, is that too, selfish? I don't know if everything I've ever done was in some elaborate way, just another selfish act of mine.\n\nI'm struggling to see the purpose of the cycle of ups and downs. I'm struggling to see where I fit into my future, and if I have one at all aside from the present day my tunnel vision is centered on. \n\nI'm sorry as well to the person I haven't responded to yet in dms.

You could say compassion and stuff like that I guess, but nothing special. I have nothing to take pride in, zero self esteem. Even my compassion is tainted by my flaws, some people don't want your compassion if your ugly, they see it as creepy and weird. \n\nI'm a Christian, and I see a lot of Christians actually not very Christian (tend to be braggers), and even as a Christian myself, I have no pride in it. I actually feel tons of shame, I don't want to be a \"child of God\" not because I don't care but because I imagine God as a beautiful being, beautiful as in not anything like me...I'm ashamed to be so ugly inside and out. I also ruin family pictures and being ugly ruins everything. When I sing praise songs, my face ruins in. When I eat, I look like a beast (like beast from beauty and the beast), my good manners don't cover up how hideous this sight is, me. \n\nI regret all those times I ever went to get my eyebrows done, or even considered getting my nails done, because I'm sooooo hideous! That's why I don't even take care of myself anymore, it's pointless. I also feel very hated on when people are mean or impatient with me, the rage in their eyes hurts my feelings, to KNOW that my existence is their trigger. They can't control their emotions, it's human nature, but I can control my presence, by not being around them, which is very isolating. \n\nAlso, why didn't anyone tell me how ridiculous I looked trying to doll up? I'm disgusting, someone should've saved me from the embarrassment, now the regret and shame is cycling  in my head in vivid flashbacks every single day. I have nothing ti be grateful for, my family is dysfunctional, not bad people, but not so great either, I've got tons if health issues where I gotta rely on them in part, I can't go out to places because I'm very medically ill, I'm in physical pain everyday all day and emotional pain too, like I didn't get to have a childhood due to health problems, I'm getting old and I've been sick nearly all my life. Doctor said he had never seen a case like mine, he's not the first to say it. I'm a \"rare\" case. This makes me feel bad, like I'm not deserving of even having health....the fact I was born very ugly too, like, is the cherry on top. Being truly ugly is also very rare, I'm ugly and a rare medical case. Could it get any worse? To think God made me this way, and still wants to (according to the Bible) resurrect me and give me an immortal body, so I could be eternally in SHAME forever. \n\nIbe been wanting to go cry in secret, get in front of the mirror and weep, but I don't want family to see this, because I'm unworthy of any compassion at all. Everyday I think about how I wish I could turn into dust and be carried away by the wind, I don't even want a funeral (my health is going down rapidly, long story). I tried ripping my baby photos up and stuff, you know, so no memories of me is left behind. Words cannot paint the picture clear enough on how much I'm grieving.\n\nAnd yeah, I admit, I have an unrealistic idea of what good people means, I guess I just wish we were all perfect, I'm depressed over it. I dont even know how to love other people genuinely, I feel dead emotionally since years ago, numb and miserable.\n ", "score": 7, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1igfz4r/i_feel_like_most_of_us_are_bad_persons_including/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1igfz4r/i_feel_like_most_of_us_are_bad_persons_including/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

i also told him i was gonna spit in his mouth, (as a joke, but a really stupid one,) told him \"fuck i love you\" (which is both weird and embarrasing), told him \"i'm gonna touch you\", which is probably the worst one of them, (i also said that as a joke, but idk if he knew that) and A LOT of similar dumb shit. he knew i liked him when i said all of those things.\n\n\\- i slapped my friend's ass. he is the opposite gender of me, and he never said it was ok for me to do that. it was meant as a joke, but that's not an excuse. i did it four times. i also said some really weird shit to him almost everyday in a pretty long period of time. i would turn almost every conversation we would have into jokes about that i wanted to suck his dick, fuck him or anything like that, and then i would laugh at my own offensive, unfunny jokes like a fucking seagull. i kinda did the same thing with another one of my friends, and i'm pretty sure i was making the other friend really uncomfortable, and i fucking hate making people uncomfortable, so why did i do it? i just really wish i could undo it, omg.\n\n\\- my friend once said something i thought sounded like a moan, and i repeated what she said, but laid extra weight on the part i thought sounded like a moan. i did that three times. the third time, she told me that she thought it was disgusting and weird, which it 100% also was. i did end up appoligizing.\n\n\\- i slapped my friend in the face for almost no reason. he started crying and i went to the bathroom and did the same thing.\n\n\\- i sometimes joke with serious topics, like ww2, putin, homophobia, racism, fatphobia, etc. the jokes i make aren't even funny, just stupid.\n\n\\- yk the guy everyone is asking to \"oil up\" in his comments? yeah, i did that. but i didn't just say \"oil up\", i said \"oil up daddy😏😫🍆 or something like that.\n\n\\- for a whole year, i faked ocd. someone i thought was cool had it. i had just moved school, and i didn't have many friends at my old school, so i would've done anything to get attention.\n\n\\- every day, i say fucked up and embarrasing shit. i don't know why i do it, i just think i don't know what else to say and end up saying weird stuff. i wish i could stop, or just shut the fuck up for once, but for some reason, i can't. i also make fun of my friends A LOT. they do the same thing with me, and i'm pretty sure they know i'm joking, but what if they don't? i just really hope they know how much i love them. i don't know why they want to be around me, i wouldn't if i were them, but i'm so happy they're in my life, i hope they're aware of that. i'm just not sure if they are.\n\nthose are just a few examples, i have prbly done worse things, those where just the ones at the top of my head. i don't know how to move on annd be better, my biggest wish is to be a good person.

I was in a well-regarded mentorship for a career transition. I (40F) was finally coming to understand my sexuality as a queer woman and was thrilled to feel curious and adventurous about sex for the first time in my life. I was a unicorn for the only cishet man I’ve ever loved and his stunning girlfriend. They are the only two people I’ve ever felt romantic love for.\n\nThey were really into the kink/poly scene in their area and encouraged me to join in. And I wanted to! I wanted to explore sexuality without the comphet script, maybe find new things to enjoy, both for myself and with all three of my partners.\n\nAnd I fucked up.\n\nThey invited me to an event with some BDSM components. I didn’t do my homework. I didn’t research the event until my tickets were already booked. I had a bad feeling in my gut but I wrote it off as my anxiety overreacting. I’d been doing good in therapy and I thought even if I did have a panic attack, I could handle it. I was wrong.\n\nI had an emotional flashback. I didn’t even know the term until that night. My body was absolutely convinced I was a tween again, being bullied and abandoned. I spent the night huddled in a stairwell, crying and shaking. I have never recovered. I tried to buck up as best I could for the sake of my unicorn partners because my trauma is my own to manage, not theirs, and it was a stressful and important weekend for my gf. She was really short-tempered with me and it ate away at my self-esteem but I was trying to be patient for her sake. I completely failed and she saw right through it. She called me out on our last night together. I had a terrible panic attack and don’t remember all of that evening but the sight of her naked, berating me for everything I had done wrong has haunted me ever since, because she was right. I am terrified of her and although I love women, I would rather go the rest of my life without sex than risk dating again.\n\nWe all got COVID the next day and it wrecked me. I got sick for a month and lost my job. I had to apply for government help. COVID wreaked havoc on my mental health and in desperation I turned to a psychedelic clinic, which is legal where I live. My regular antidepressants and therapy weren’t cutting it anymore.\n\nThe clinic left me more damaged than ever. My beloved therapist has been trying to pick up the pieces but after 11 years together, I truly think she’s done all she can for me. She’s in her 70’s and wants to retire and she absolutely deserves it. After the clinic, I got even worse. My art mentor put me on probation and then kicked me out altogether. He sent me the second worst email I have ever received, detailing all my faults as a human being. In doing so, he helped me understand why my parents told me they thought I would never find a partner.\n\nI’d broken up with the girl half of the unicorn couple but the guy half was an old and dear friend. However, over the past year I have come to understand how incredibly one-sided our relationship is. I have always been the one to text or call, to visit, etc. It has torn me apart to really come to terms with how little he actually cares for me. But he’s right, because I am a wretched, horrible person. I can’t even fuck because I’m a tiny woman and it hurts and I was always taught that loving men was dangerous and would make me weak and vulnerable. Well, it has.\n\nI was brought up in an extremely fatphobic and sex-negative home. I learned to hate my body by the time I was 14, and it only got worse when I developed grotesquely huge breasts. I was just starting to develop a tolerance for my body when this shit hit the fan and now I hate it more than ever. I wish I had a hot knife to slice off my boobs and carve my genitals into bloody strips. I just spent the past half hour raking my nails across my pubis and punching myself in the vulva screaming “I HATE YOU!!!”\n\nI hate my body. I hate what the desire for a sex life has done to me. I hate my mum for teaching me to feel so much shame about my body that even twenty years of therapy and pills can’t cure me. The only reason I’m still alive is that I have incredible friends, and because mum already tried to kill herself once before, I know how it hurts and I won’t do the same to them.\n\nThe only thing I want more than death is for my friends to be safe and happy. They want me to live. I don’t. I want to die. I hate being alive. But I would hate hurting them more. They are the only ones who know that my “successful professional creative woman” persona is as cheap and thin as tissue paper.\n\nIf I commit suicide, it will hurt them. I want an accident to take my life.

Some people in my family have round \"baby face\" as well, but it suits them, but not me. A lot of men told me having this kind of face shape is a flaw in women's appearance.

I feel like I am worse than of the rest of girls taller than me. \n\nThe same thing I see online, I see how tall girls are putting down the short ones saying they'll never be beautiful or hot, just \"cute\" and they're worse. I am aware short girls are putting down tall ones, it works both ways, but lately my fyp on tiktok or instagram is filled with hateful tall girls. Once, I made a tiktok where I was comparing my height to heights of my fav bands' members and girls younger and taller than me were literally saying \"sorry\", also were surprised how I am that short. I feel embarrassed. \n\nAs I mentioned in some of my posts, I'm in love with dark feminine aesthetic and this is how I wear. I want to be beautiful, feminine, hot and sexy, even if my face isn't good looking. I want to feel good with myself, but the only \"compliment\" I get is only \"cute\". I don't want to be cute. I'm not trying to be cute. People comment on me like this when they find out or see how short I am. \n\nFor example, I made a similiar post like this where I was saying how I want to feel about myself, I wrote about my height insecurity, and some guys told me: \"Men prefer girls like you because you're petite and cute\". Petite, yes, I am, but cute? When I literally said I want to be a confident, bossy looking woman? I had a lot of situations like this, no matter if online or in real life. I don't want to be cute.

It’s so easy to just let myself feel bad and let the cycle perpetuate itself over and over. It’s so comfy to just sit at rock bottom. To just rest. It’s familiar, it’s quiet. I don’t like it here but I physically can’t get out. I’m losing it, again. And I only found it so recently too. I just can’t see the point in continuing the cycle of unmitigated and seemingly inevitable pain, just to reach the destination I could skip ahead to right now anyway??? It seems futile.

You’ve spent your entire existence feeding on the people around you, draining them dry like the parasite you are, and what do you give in return? Nothing. Not even crumbs. You’re not some tragic figure, misunderstood and burdened. You’re a walking pile of garbage—worse, actually, because even garbage serves a purpose. You? You’re just a glorified dumpster, sitting there, taking up space, and stinking up everything you touch. And the truth is, no one respects you. No one likes you. Everyone just tolerates you because they're too afraid of what you’ll do if they don’t.\n\nYou want to know how everyone really feels? They'd be better off if you didn’t exist. And not even you as a whole, but that twisted, disgusting thing you call a soul. That rotten core inside you that takes pleasure in everyone else’s pain, that manipulates, lies, and tears people apart just to make yourself feel like you matter. That part of you?

You'd be a living example of what your kind deserve, you'd actually be worth something for once. That would be more help than you’ve ever been since the day you were born.\n\nFace it, you’ve ruined every chance anyone has ever given you. You’ve made yourself into something no one can love, no one can trust, no one can even stand to be around. You’re not better than anyone. No, you’re worse than everyone. And you know it. You know it every second of every day, and that’s why you cling to this sick, broken version of yourself—because it’s easier than changing. Plain and simple, everyone is done with you. You can keep living in your little delusion, but don’t expect anyone else to stay in it with you. You’re trash, in every sense of the word, and that’s all you’ll ever be until you decide to destroy everything that is you and start over.

I have general tendency for strong and convincing self hatred, but it‘s never been that bad like it‘s been for the last couple of days. I hate myself so freaking much that already showering or sleeping feels like too much self care, not to mention doing something i could actually enjoy. It was triggered by a therapy session in which the topic of resilience came up. Has always been a difficult concept for me because if I was born with a resilence below average, I‘m simply a crybaby and it‘s literally in my genes that I developed symptoms from how my parents treated me, even if they had treated me like many parents treat their kids that don‘t develop symptoms. I was able to fight against the self hate a bit with some cognitive work. Cognitive is the only thing that works for me in these situations. You have to give me like the most convincing and logical argument ever and then, if my self hate can‘t come up with a comeback, I‘m a tiny bit safer. But now the self hate came back with another theme lol. I‘ve had that several times, but this time it‘s so so strong. It‘s telling me that my mom didn‘t even do that much that hurt me emotionally as a child. That it was nothing. And that I‘m a horrible person for blaming her for my symptoms, even calling her my abuser. For context, my therapist said that my mom built a rather emotionally cold environment with high requirements of performance in various ways. To me, that doesn‘t sound bad idk. She could‘ve been an alcoholic and be passed out 24/7 or she could‘ve insulted me in front of others or she could‘ve stopped speaking to me completely whenever she didn‘t like what I did. So yeah.. TW! Honestly, the only thing that feels good at the moment is thinking of hurting myself really bad (not like „typical“ self harm, but more like ripping my whole body apart) or the thought of being punished extensively.. \n\nSo, the biggest help would be if someone had some really strong (and not just the common) arguments against what my self hatred is telling me and if you‘re ok with me (more like my self hatred) contradicting. \nApart from that, I‘d also be grateful for non-fiction book recommendations. But know that if there‘s anything like „How to start loving yourself“ or „Your way to self compassion“ in the title, I will not start reading it because that‘s not where my self hatred wants to go.. If you still think one of these books could really help me, please just put a convincing quote, that might help to convince me to still have a look at the book.\nAlso fiction books or movies or songs or just quotes that express self hatred are great, it helps to see I‘m not alone with this problem.\n\nPlease just don‘t comment things like „It doesn‘t matter if others had it worse“ because it DOES very much matter to me and it will still after that comment. Also I think I need more like a psychoanalysis, deep, look at the causes kinda approach than pure CBT stuff because I won‘t be able to say an affirmation and I‘m not able to rephrase my thoughts at the moment. The thing I‘m trying to achieve really is to find a convincing argument against the self hate and sometimes you can find them in a non-fiction book. \n\nThanks y‘all in advance :‘)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1hgzxvh/what_is_an_argument_against_my_self_hate/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1hgzxvh/what_is_an_argument_against_my_self_hate/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Every time I think back about my past or something that happened when I was a kid all I can think about is the fact that all my friends were dating and having sex with women at that age and I was a stupid loser getting completely ignored. I couldn’t take this anymore so around the middle of high school, I started striving to self improve. Ever since 2020 I’ve been consistently working out, meditating, journaling, reading, creating, working on a business, I even did what I consider to be the hardest part of it all and worked on bettering my social skills, specifically with women. Since the start of this year I’ve been approaching girls and trying to catch up and still, despite all of this effort, I’m still alone. I’m still a virgin, I’m still a loser, girls still don’t find me attractive, all of the women whose numbers I get they just ignore me. This has done nothing for me but make me despise myself. How much of an ugly piece of shit do you have to be to put in all of this work just to still be absolutely unfuckable. Sometimes I think about my life for the past 5 years and I just bust out laughing at how pathetic I am, what was the point of anything I’ve done? The worst part is normal people don’t have to do any of this stuff. There are guys 4 years younger than me who’ve dated and had relationships, they’ve never had to meditate everyday, or go to the gym and track their calories everyday for years. It’s like the harder I work the more I realize how inherently worthless I am as a human being, especially as a romantic partner. If I’m still this unattractive to women now after all this improvement, what the hell did they think of me before? I can’t even figure out what’s wrong with me. I’m pretty neurotypical and know how to socialize, I take care of my looks (physique smell body grooming) more than most people do because I’ve never had a gf, and some people say I’m good looking and yet my life reflects the complete opposite in every single way imaginable. I don’t think I should’ve ever been born, clearly I’ll never be good enough no matter what I do. I’ll never get to experience the touch of a girl who loves me, and nobody will even tell me why. Maybe it’s because I’m short, or because I’m just inherently ugly. But at this point I’m starting to believe it’s just some invisible force outside of my control that I can’t understand. I’m literally going crazy and I don’t know what to do know. There’s a part of me that just wants to kill myself because I can’t imagine living like this for another decade. Even if I somehow managed to finally get a girl, I would probably still hate myself, because the fact is it took me 21 years and incredibly hard grind to do something normal men do when their 15, and while I had to literally put in all of my effort, those men had to do nothing. That one fact alone confirms my low value worthlessness and existence. I will never break this cycle. I will never stop hating myself for being an ugly stupid baby faced virgin. I will never forget how alone and depressed I feel now. Even if I get a gf it won’t solve anything, because the fact I had to go through any of this in the first place is eternal confirmation of the fact I’m so worthless I should’ve never been born.

So currently im in a highschool dropout, im a unemployed loser with no motivation no self esteem im a broke sad dissapointment at the age of 17 soon to be 18 years old, I used to have many goals and had extreme confidence that I was able to accomplish them, Im just really fucking depressed and I want out of this reality that I have created for myself. On the other hand my girlfriend who is a very strong, kind compasionate, caring loving person who is very succesful at the moment she is 16 years old as a junior, works a part time job, has many goals and is actively making accomplishments,   she is no where near as miserable I am and I just feel like im a drag for her like im a anchor that will cause both of us to drown.  I feel so fucking bad for her I just wish that she would leave me already I mean I tried to get back on my feet but I was incompetent to do so I failed so many times at everything that ive tried, I got no hobbies no friends nothing and she is still with me I never understand why but something about her makes her love people even if they hurt her or bad for her, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder causing  her to be attached to me, I love her I truely do and I think that the best I can do for her is to just not exist in her life, everytime I suggest a breakup for this reason she gets really emotional talking about how she cant lose me and that she would be nothing without me, which I think is a delusion , talking about how im the only thing she looks forward to in life and that she would do everything and anything to help me, but thats not what I want from her I want her to be succesful in her own world and stop allowing herself to be distracted by me, we have been together 6 months and she suggests that we will grow old and enter a marriage, which seems impossible for me to accomplish as im unmotivated and think that I will forever be , I cant have her helping me with stuff because my self esteem and remaining bits of pride that I have will crumble and indefinetely cause me to off myself as I already want to do so. I really hope that one day I will become the supportive man that I said I would be for her when we first started dating.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1h55b7a/my_girlfriend_should_leave_me_im_such_a_loser/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1h55b7a/my_girlfriend_should_leave_me_im_such_a_loser/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Went to college 3 months later with full ride scholarships. Used to reside in the dorms and all I had to worry about was getting my education and working a part-time job so I can buy some things here and there. \n\nWell right before I graduated high school my mom unexpectedly passed away. Ever since then my mental health has deteriorated and it's affected me in a major way. When I went to college the following fall semester, I wasn't complete shambles. I was still grieving the loss of my mother and didn't apply myself like I usually do academically. I kept skipping class and wasting my time just laying on my bed rotting. \n\nI didn't take my education seriously and it's my biggest life regret. I was so suicidal when I was on campus I would probably post on my social media about me wanting to kill myself and my actions that would lead to various attempts. I've had the police knocked on my dorm door so many times. I had so many opportunities to fix it with therapy, but I never took them on. I would just exist on campus.\n\nEventually my grades were so low that I couldn't afford going back to college because my scholarship stopped paying me. Like I said it earlier, that's my biggest regret. Now 4 years later, at age 23, I feel like I've hit my lowest and my dreams may not be possible anymore. I literally just want to go back to University and finish what I started. But it's a lot harder to do that because now I have to worry about making enough money to provide for myself and other things. My mental health is still really bad, I suffer through major depressive disorder, anxiety, and occasional psychosis, and I feel like those are some of my biggest obstacles towards continuing my education. \n\nI hate that I go through these things because I don't want to normalize giving myself excuses, but because of these issues I'm not able to go to school while being able to provide for myself to this degree. It's more expensive to live now than it's ever been, with many people needing two jobs just to barely scrape by. I don't think I can handle that while going back to school. It sucks. I had it so easier earlier and all I needed to do was suck it up and take therapy seriously and get help. Now it's too late for me. \n\nEspecially considering that I'm in a completely different state from where I originally graduated high school and went to college, I think this is it for my dreams. I can't go back to school. I don't know how to go back to school. No one knows how to help me, and I know that sounds very pathetic considering that I am a grown ass man and should be able to help myself, but it's tough when you're dealing with so many mental issues. \n\nMy dream career is dead. My career is dead. Going back to school is impossible for me now. I'm just very upset right now.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1gx37f5/my_dreams_are_dead_bc_i_cant_go_back_to_college/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1gx37f5/my_dreams_are_dead_bc_i_cant_go_back_to_college/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

No, studies have shown no substantial difference in empathy levels between men and women. The claim that we're emotionally intelligent is yet another fib to make us feel better about ourselves.

The male variability hypothesis proves that men will pretty much always be smarter and more innovative than we are. This is biological, not societal, so there's no way to fix or change this. What's the point in living at all? Being a girl means you're inferior in both mind and body. We could literally disappear tomorrow and the world would stay the exact same (barring reproduction). Men are even better at raising kids than we are. We're just too stupid to contribute to the progression of the human race, which is why men will always be superior to us. Whatever contributions made by women are greatly exaggerated and inflated, often deliberately so. Ada Lovelace was a fraud, and the contributions that women did make were not all that great (they weren't theoretical or abstract in any way). Women are insanely weak. Even teenage boys can beat us easily. It's fucking pathetic. Richard Lynn and Paul Irving have also proven that we have lower IQs. We're not smart, and the disparity is even worse for us on the extreme end due to male variability. We can't even hold the parenting role properly - children of single fathers do much better than the children of single mothers. So, fathers are way more important than mothers will ever be. We're biologically useless and should be replaced with artificial wombs. Just admit it. Humanity literally doesn't need us, not even as mothers or caregivers. If artificial wombs were a thing, we could vanish off of the planet and nobody would even notice or care. We'd lose next to nothing. Nobody would miss us. Everything with men involved is automatically better. We make everything worse. We ruin everything, from music to science to film to philosophy. Everything that's great or excellent is exclusively male. We lack the physical and mental endowments to contribute anything to human progress. Men are smarter and stronger than us, so we aren't needed at all. It's humiliating to be inferior not just physically, but mentally as well.

My roommate's asleep in her bed and I am alone in mine. Well, for the past few days, more prominently than usual, I have been feeling quite insecure. Comparison has never done me any good. It only points out the flaws I have in me. If it’s not a physical one then it’s a personality thing. I feel so fucking ugly. I know I’m not ugly. Or am I ? I don’t even know what’s right for me to believe. The more time I spend online the more my head spirals. I am pathetic. I hook up with a guy to then stalk his following and compare myself to the girls he follows. Hysterically they all end up being drop dead gorgeous. How fun. So now I’m sitting here, breaking apart and analyzing these girls I have never encountered in person. A bit creepy I will admit. Why do I have to spend hours trying to figure out ways to look “skinny” in pictures or see what angles work best for me. Why do I have to practice “picture faces” so I don’t end up hating every single fucking photo that’s taken of me? While they just look fucking ethereal. But again the real issue is I don’t have to do all that. I have a choice not to. I realize that. Yet I go back, time and time again. I fall into the suffocating and lonely pit of depression and jealousy. I have heard it’s common though. In girls my age they say. Well I wonder what people go through then, pretty people with pretty problems. I mean I’d rather look like Angelina Jolie and feel ugly than be myself and experience those emotions. Because I know. I know I wouldn’t be truly ugly if I was her. People say I overthink. I do. They also keep reassuring me about my “beauty”. The fact that I need these affirmations makes me sick. I feel unwanted but lusted over. I have a hunger for attention that I feed through male validation. How do I get this validation? Tits. Honestly though, men don’t care. You can be pretty passing and have a nice enough body for them to fuck you. They will fuck *you.* Hell, they’d probably fuck anyone. If not one then another. Anyways, like I said male validation. So I dress all slutty, do my makeup at 7 am in the morning for people to look at me. Yes, because apparently I’m pretty but not pretty enough to be looked at when I’m wearing a hoodie. Or when I’m not wearing any makeup. It’s even worse when you’re not smart, or good at anything else. You can be ugly but immensely talented. You know? Pick a struggle type thing. Me, on the other hand, I’m not even blessed with talents or hobbies. Forget academics. Which brings me to the steady and lasting title of being *“average”.* Average sucks. Well it wouldn’t if I was content with being average. Why would anyone be okay with being average? Sometimes it hurts more than being worse than average. It’s like I’m being tangled between becoming a complete failure to getting to the candy: living a good fucking life. So, back to my insecurities. It’s no surprise if you’ve read this much that I have an eating disorder. If it is then you’re quite ignorant of signs. When I see these girls,”pretty but pretty because they’re so skinny” I think. Man, why can’t I just think they’re pretty just because they are. If I lose 10 more pounds, I would be unstoppable. Anyways, I got strayed off topic. Back to the guy now. We hook up, no mention of dating. Fair, it’s only been a few weeks. Or maybe he just doesn’t want to date. I delude myself that I am not ready for that either but what if I am ? I mean I would be miserable in a relationship, I would never stop scrutinizing myself and declaring I wasn’t good enough. But also, it would be nice to be loved. Did he get with me because I was easy? I did give in quite quickly. But still, he got with me. That means I’m not ugly to the extent that people wouldn’t make out with me. Yet I guess I’m not pretty enough for people to date? They say you can’t love anyone until you love yourself. I have come up with the perfect excuse for that statement: you can love someone so dearly that it compensates for your lack of self love. You can love someone so much that you think you are not good enough for them. That’s still love right? I'll lie to myself and believe it is. So I will try and mold myself into what I think is the criteria of beauty for that person. The person I love. By the time I fulfill that, however, will it even matter? Will he still be available? Will it even be worth it if I know he’s finally into me after I have changed? After I have gotten skinnier. More prettier. Will it still matter? Ironically enough, I know I will never satisfy my standards for what I need to be. So, basically, I will never get my answer to any of those questions. I don’t even love him though. Fuck. I hate myself to a degree next to which simple forms of affection, care and crush seem like feelings much deeper than they actually should be or are. Right, I’m so aware and attuned of my mental problems. Quite frankly, that doesn’t matter. I know I need to get help but I also know I wouldn’t want to change. Messed up. Messed up but me.

I'm also really bad at small talk and continuing conversations, so the other person has to carry whatever conversation we need to have. In group setting I'm just another person taking up space, I enjoy the conversations that other people have, but me being there makes them feel like they have to include me and anytime I try to join it makes them uncomfortable. Most people pity me and are nice about it though. It doesn't help that I'm not particularly good at anything. My presence often does more harm than good.\n\nI'm a sophmore in college and I just have no idea what I'm doing. I feel like everyone knows something that I missed or something. In almost every class, the professor will be talking about something and I just sit there confused about when we learned this, while everyone else seems to be falling along. This happens in classes where everyone is confused as well, but I feel like I have a harder time understanding things than other people do. I don't think that's always been a problem, I used to be really good in school. It just seems like the older I get, the less I'm able to comprehend and remember. \n\nI don't feel like a productive member of society, I'm 19 and I can't drive and I've never held a job. This may not sound terrible, but in my neck of the woods it's a sure sign that you're a dissapointment and a mooch to the people around you. \n\nI constantly try to learn how to drive, but my ability to comprehend my surroundings isn't up to par with what it's supposed to be. I need clear instructions on how to maneuver the vehicle and what I should be looking for to tell where I am in relation to everything else. Everyone I've talked to about it, just looks confused that I can't tell how big the car is when I'm inside of it. I also have a terrible reaction time, which I know is going to get someone killed. I'm so scared everytime I get behind the wheel that I'm going to take someone's life. \n\nI had a job for about 4 days before I quit. I was just so anxious that everyone was judging everything I did. It felt like they were all constantly looking at me picking out every flaw and insecurity I had. My eyes often betray me, they show the world my fear and I'm hated for it. I know they're judging me, I can see it on their faces, I can feel their eyes. I haven't been able to get a job since then. I know I should see a psychiatrist or something, but I can't afford it without getting a job, and I can't get a job without getting help. \n\nIdk man, it isn't always that bad, but my friend wants to get an apartment at the end of the school year. I've been really stressed trying to figure out how I'm going to do that when I don't even have a car. This is something she really want to do and I want to do it with her, but it really isn't feasible for my situation. I know she feels responsible for me, because we're best friends and we've shared a dorm room for the last two years, she's also in a better place in life than I am. She already has to consider if I need to go anywhere whenever she drives somewhere. When she was talking about having a guy over in our dorm she literally asked our friends if they could take me for a few hours like I was a child she had to take care of. I don't really feel like an adult, so I guess that was a fair judgement. But it's not like I wasn't going to have a place to sleep or something, it was literally just a few hours out of the room, I could've spent that in the library doing work. I feel like I'm holding her back and I don't want her to realize that I am and resent me for it. Because then she'll leave me and take our other friends with her and I'll be alone. \n\nI know that it's unfair that she needs to be so considerate of me and that I should stop holding her back, but she's my best friend. I hate that I'm so dependent on her to do anything. I'm trying really hard to get a job, but when I walked into a store alone to ask if they were hiring I could bring myself to ask. There were so many people and I just felt terrified of all of them. I'd don't understand why I was genuinely afraid of random people in a store, this only really happens when I'm alone. I'm trying to work through it, because I really need to start saving money for this apartment, but I just don't see a way. \n\nThis was really long and probably doesn't make much sense,  I'm not great at articulating myself. I just needed to share this with someone, I can't bother my friends with all of this. \n", "score": 8, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1g2hjeq/im_a_burden/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1g2hjeq/im_a_burden/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It's been over 2 years of feeling this way and I think it's starting to show on the outside as well. Like my appearance, attitude, and and even physical mannerisms are changing... I hate it and I want to be given a chance for me to prove myself and change.\n\nThough I try not to compare myself, hopefully I can share why I'm failing at this thing we call life.\n\nDuring school, I was lucky enough to join an awesome retail store and work there for my whole studies, even after graduation. After more than 4.5 years working the same part-time role and improving my metrics to be consistently a top performer on the team, I was expecting a promotion and a permanent role but was \"accidentally\" ignored by the manager, responsible for hiring - to a dude who kept complaining about the financial and chronological costs of having a baby.. This was 2 years ago and I think that's where my cynicism started. Given I had to work hourly, and with a bachelors degree too was not a good feeling. I ended up staying to earn my 5 year recognition award and then dipped when I got enough savings.. But here I am now 2 months since being laid off and can't think of my previous company or coworkers without thinking of betrayal. Shortly after graduating, and a few months after the retail promotion incident, I got a job in my field of study. Small office and team, in the heart of the big city - Given my lack of a co-op during school, countless job applications to the big companies returned nothing. The job sounded amazing - finally, I could end my retail job, earn a decent wage, and maybe think of home ownership or starting a family in 5 years - but I had to break up with the love of my gf at the time. (will talk about this later)\n\nWhen I got started, I couldn't help but feel lonely, bored, and ultimately severely unmotivated. good parts of the job: getting reimbursed for a couple of exams (out of 6 that I needed for a designation/certification), an awesome manager/lead, and an being able to say \"yea, I work in {name of big city}\". bad things of the job: no sense of community in small team of 10, the commute to work was 1.5 hours one-way, and I was running out of the same mundane and redundant work to do. I ended up even automating the process in hopes of getting more responsibility or more tasks but that hope quickly faded when our COO/Office Manager brought in his son and cared more about him having something to do than the rest of his employees. Then as I got closer to a coworker who only recently joined our team share with me that the culture is lacking and that we'd have a better chance leaving, I believed him. He quit, and shortly afterwards, I was referred to a tech company by a close friend from the retail job.\n\nAt the tech company, it was a remote job that wasn't in my field of study but it was remote and had better benefits so I took it. However, I always had this weird feeling... Everyone was so nice, it didn't feel genuine at all.I didn't care much about it. it was remote and I got a puppy to keep me company and moved to the country with good neighbors anyways. I just tried to do my best, and share my ideas as I saw them. that was basically my job - to point out issues with our company's application/platform and improve our team's standards. This year, I moved back into the big city with my sister to help her get closer to her new job. I knew the pain of the daily commute so I thought splitting rent with her would be appreciated. However, being the little brother seems to be a forever role. Even though she wouldn't have gotten the chance to live downtown without teaming up on the apartment with me, I'm always ignored, blamed for random things, and simply don't get respect at home. This stress mixed with the lack of involvement from my team lead led to a lot of stress and anxiety. I already have ADHD but I try my best to not let it get to me, however, I needed help. I sought out therapy, found an awesome therapist but still my lead was very hands off but blamed me for many of the shortcomings of our team. Though I requested to maintain our weekly 1:1 meetings, he would constantly push them off or cancel a day before, leaving me feeling completely depressed about work. Then after being late a few times, and sharing to him that I was going to therapy to help with the tardiness, stress, and lack of motivation, he responded that he \"I do appreciate you being honest and sharing as well. Remember that while we are your leadership (I hesitate to use the term authority), we are here to help and want you to succeed at the end of the day...I hope to continue to work with you, and be part of that journey as it's been great having you on the team.\" Following this, me canceled our 1:1 meeting for two weeks, and on a Monday \\~1030AM, I was surprised fired/laid-off for \"performance issues\". I felt terribly betrayed as I was being vulnerable and sharing my personal issues only for them to turn it against me. Looks like all the new age DEI and mental health well-being bullshit these companies spit out is just an act.\n\nIt's been 2 months since I was laid off because the job market is terrible. I can barely think of going to any company without feeling that I would either be stuck in another nepotistic office, or somewhere else where I cannot ever being myself. I've applied to jobs in m y niche area of study, customer support jobs, dog groomer jobs, solicited for manual labour work in my neighborhood, and can't even get ubereats deliveries in the city because the amount of immigrants and other cyclists get. My severance has run out and I'm still in credit card debt...\n\nI got a a little bit debt from being with my last girlfriend (2 years ago) when I left my job, from eating out, and going on little trips, but it was never over $1500 and I wasn't ever fazed as it was always paid off over a couple months. Instead, going out on these dates and trips with her was awesome. We already lived together so I only saw it as a numerical value to how much motivation she gave me and how much I would risk for her. But once I got that job and moved into the big city, I couldn't help but feel lonely and unmotivated. Though I initially planned to live with my parents (1.5hr commute to work) to save money in hopes that if I became richer my ex would join me in the city and live together again, with the lack of friends in the big city or in my parents neighborhood, I quickly regressed to the same high school friends as before. I drank and smoked weed really often. Also did other stuff in the last two years that I've only dabbled in before. Now if I get a little buzz, I want to get really wasted, really quickly. If I drove, I really want to and love to drive drunk. I went from the guy who only drank heavily in college to socially once I met my girlfriend and back to a dumb idiot who'd clear a case of beer in a week or less. All I want to do is smoke weed, get drunk, take psychs till I suicide or snort coke till my heart stops. the most tame thing that I was addicted to was porn, but even being addicted to porn is fucking shameful af. my credit card debt has climbed up to over $12k. That's when I knew I needed help. I moved away from the friends (into the big city), started to go on runs, return to a run club for social life, and get therapy (mentioned above). Besides the time I was a competitive athlete in high school, I'm possibly at the fittest I've been in my adult life. even though I had a terrible stitch the first 5km, I just ran a half marathon yesterday and beating my best time by 6 minutes. However, I'm still a failure financially as I still smoked a ton of weed up until a few weeks ago. My credit card debt is up to $18k from terrible decision making.\n\nI can't fall in love with any girls that I've met since I left my girlfriend. When we've met up since I've left, she wouldn't want to be together. Her reasons before was that she didn't want to go back into a LDR relationship again (we had been long distance for 10 months out of our 30 month relationship, of which the last 17 months we had lived together). But ever since I left my old job for the tech job, she also found a job in film and doesn't seem interested in getting into a relationship at all. My presumption is that she found someone else, seeing them casually, and probably earns more and is more physically attractive too. I've met an awesome person in the big city lately but when it came time to get intimate my porn addiction or anxiety hit me and I had my truest feeling of not being able to get it up. I didn't have any excuses, there was this girl I was attracted to, I was sober, fit, and yet I couldn't get it up. She put me in the friend zone and we still jog together weekly but tbh I kinda hate that I'm not even seen as an option for her to date or pursue anymore. I guess being laid off kinda put the nail in the coffin on that too.\n\nSo yea. All I can hope now is that I can use the last bit of my credit to get LASIK and get a job with the local police dept, or join the military and be some type of operator rather than a simple infantryman, while staying as stoic with drug/alcohol usage as possible.\n\nsorry that was longer than I expected. thanks for reading if you did.\n\nTLDR: A ton of High interest debt and a dog that depends on me but gives me the reason to keep living and staying healthy. No job, or responses from job applications. No GF and the only girls that give me attention either only want sex or want to be friends.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1g1rveh/hard_to_hide_the_fact_that_im_a_failure/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1g1rveh/hard_to_hide_the_fact_that_im_a_failure/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I can think  \"this murderer is very handsome\" and can't get that out of my head. I know it is wrong and I don't fangirl around too. I like to read about murder, gore and cults. I hate thinking about pregnancy. It is the top thing that disgusts me. Probably the only thing I'm scared of. I can't even get scared of the truth that i could get raped or killed on a random day.

I just enjoyed it and i was addicted i just cut for no reason at all. I used to see weird shit that aren't real. I knew that but it is hard to tell your brain that they are not real.

I've learned that it is not acceptable to be braless if you have big boobs, and I hate it. I had a very deep conversation with my mom about girl problems. It was nighttime, and everyone was wearing their pajamas (not wearing bras), so I decided to do the same thing. Once, I changed into my pajamas and wore no bra. All my girl cousins kept constantly looking at my chest every time I talked to them. Then my mother stepped me out into another room to talk to me about putting a bra on. I told her why? And she basically said it's inappropriate what I was wearing, mind you I was wearing a very large baggy shirt. I told her none of my cousin's were wearing bra. I am tired of getting boob rashes and wearing an uncomfortable bra 24/7 just to make other people feel comfortable. But even when I cried and told her that I am sick and tired of people constantly judging me for something, I can't control. It's bad enough that I get harassed daily by men, I don't like to dress up thanks to them. But it's annoying when other women also judge you too, when does it end? I wear baggy clothes just to not draw attention, but the one time I didn't wear a bra, it's a bad thing. Bra or not, I can tell when people look at my boobs and I find it so annoying. I've gotten many looks from people and sometimes I want to punch them in the face. \n\nAnyways, my mother just brushed it under the rug and told me to wear a jacket or towel around to cover my chest. She also told me that maybe if I lost weight, I would be happier. Even when I was skinner before, I still hated my body and developed an eating disorder. I told her me being skinny didn't make me happy then, so why would it make me happy now if I lost weight? And wth did that have to do with me wanting to go braless for night like all my cousins were doing??? Anyways, I'm getting off topic. \n\nI told her I hate being a woman because of things like this. Women get judged for everything, especially women who have a curvy bodies. From my experience, I noticed women with curvy bodies aren't taken seriously at all and are literally viewed as whores more than girls with a skinny figures (thanks to social media/porn brainwashing people what the ideal \"perfect\" body type is supposed to look like). But again, that's my experience, and I deeply hate it.  My mom still didn't seem to understand what I was talking about.

Thus, embrace pain. One must realise that there is no escape from it. Once it is realised, then life will be only pain, and there will be nothing else. All meaning is lost. Many both in past times and in present have compared life to a game. If life is a game, and society its mediator and benefactor, then there is no choice but to play it. The game is not one of choice, it forces itself upon you and you are left with two choices: To play the game, or to die. Both paths lead to death, both lead to pain and to suffering. If you choose not to play the game, then it will, with its great might, force you into wretched conditions, and you will thus be left to die. Only a small few have withdrawn from the game and lived their lives well, yet they do so selfishly, as they benefit only themselves by doing so, yet their reasoning for doing so is not poor. If the game, being so broken as it is, cannot change, then withdraw from it. Yet this method only works for those who can sustain themselves completely, and who from such have great joy and gleefulness. Thus, for nearly everyone, they must play the game, for if not, death ensues. Yet the game itself is death. One feeds into the system, working from morning to evening, yet to receive little pay. To live without any purpose other than to feed into the system, to feed the economy, the market, the government, the nations of the world. Yet with so much money abound, there is yet still many who are poor. Only very few are to live in wealth, yet even such does not relieve one's part in the great game. Only those at the very top can truly gain, but all the rest, even the well off, live poorly. Yet all people in this time, live with neither purpose nor with true virtue. Gone are the days of honour, of heroism, of virility. Gone are the days when kings sat in golden halls, adorned with quilted cloth. Gone are the times of heroes and noble defenders. Gone by, are the olden hours when feasting and joyful cries were heard. Gone are the days when men and women alike, honoured God and man, and lived in temperance. Now, in this time, man is broken down in every way. All things which once made man human, are now gone. Truthfully, hope is lost, and vanity abounds. It is a shame to think that even in the days of yore, all of their joy was vain, all of their glory and beauty; vain, and yet we who are their descendants, now live as broken shells, who await death. All that was, that is, and will to be is vain. *“Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity. What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun? A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever. The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises. The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns. All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again. All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done and there is nothing new under the sun. Is there a thing of which it is said, ‘See, this is new’? It has been already in the ages before us. There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.”* Truly, to live is a curse, for once brought into the game, you cannot escape hither. God forbids any man take his own life, and in such, curses us all to suffer at his whim. No longer is there clarity, no longer is there peace, no longer is there hope, or certainty of a better future. Now, all things are beginning to decay, even the mind, decays, withers, shrouds into nothingness. Man in this time is left to horror. For we born in this time, are born too late to explore the earth, and too early to explore the universe. We are thus left to explore the depths of depravity, the deepest recesses of insanity, the greatest heights of wickedness, the darkest shroud of evil. This time, being terrible, has crushed the mind of mankind, by crushing both his will and his mind. It is so that now mankind has little to live for, and nothing to die for, and if man has nothing to die for, it is better he not live at all. Yet in this dilemma is all mankind found, desiring death, yet death will not come to us, thus we must wait until the hour of death to end this wretched life. There is neither beauty, nor substance, nor sanctity, nor greatness. Only evil remains, and man is left to an unnatural state. As God esteemed the ancestors of old, and the ancient heroes, for their sins, he punishes us and leaves us with a world not worth dying for, and not good enough to live in. The line betwixt earth and hell are blurred, as both seem the same enough to me. A wretched fate, a great terror, all is as such, yet mankind must not be foolish to unendure. Thou mankind, must look at what is, not what thou dost wish to see. For if thou seest the world, then thou shalt desire death, and death to thee shall not come. To those desiring death, God will give long life, and to those desiring long life he gives death. All fortune is no longer in these days, as pain and toil is great, yet reward dost not abound. What purpose is it that mankind in this age rises early, to work all his days, yet only to have measly return? What use in this age is it, that the rich may have a harem, and the poor noth but dirt? What is it, that ugliness permeates all things, yet beauty is a thing of the ancestors? What is it, that we have been cast down to hell, yet remain on earth, only looking to a small part of a greater hell we are destined for? Did not the ancestors suffer natural toils? Did not they suffer war, famine, and plague? Yet does not modern man live free from such? Well then, if such be so then let it be so, but modern man lives worsley than they who reigned before. Does not modern man live in poverty? Does not modern man live alone? Is not the modern man depressed, wishing death unto himself? Is not modern man without friend or foe, without a helper, without beauty? Is not this world turned to machine, to brick, to stone, that the old ways be gone, and the new ways unable to sustain? Why is it that the modern man looks to the past for his comfort, yet those who lived in the past looked about them, and there their comfort was? Spoiled be the ancestors, who had glory in their day. Now all is to rot, and we who live are forsaken.\n\n", "score": 8, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1fpnduh/a_most_wonderful_poem_i_have_written/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/SelfHate/comments/1fpnduh/a_most_wonderful_poem_i_have_written/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Thought I was in a good place, and I was. And then my actual personality caught up with everything good. I'm in college now, have been for a bit. Tried like hell to get good grades and I did for a bit. And now only a few weeks into the new semester I can't bring myself to go to class. I have a C already when I used to pride myself on being a straight A student (something I only ever achieved in college, pretty much had straight D's and F's through highschool). My relationship that I thought would be my endgame is turning out to be toxic and I don't know how to navigate it. Can't tell if I'm being crazy or if I'm being reasonable. I realize as time goes on that I don't really like myself, which makes sense when i look around and realize nobody else does either. I fought like hell to try and make friends. Thought I did it and made it into a good group, but it almost feels like the whole experience was just out of pity for me. Don't get talked to by them anymore. Don't get asked to go out with them. I'm nothing to them, and why should I be? They act nice when I force myself to reach out bc \"what if they're just busy?\" But then I realize, no. They see eachother everyday.

But then I realize I would be pissed at me too. I would call me crazy too. I would threaten to leave me too. I'm jealous. I'm envious of everybody that has everything that I don't. I hate pretty people because they make me hate myself for not looking like them. I hate social people because I could never alter my personality to be the way theirs is. I don't have an attractive personality. People don't like being around me. I want to be smart and I want to be perceived as intelligent but I find myself falling short of my own ground level standards at every point. I'm not smart. I've always believed I had some level of intelligence that set me apart from others, even if only in my own inner monologue, but I can't even believe my own bullshit lies anymore. I need other people to lift me up and validate me as a likable person, but it never happens and it never has. I'm let down everytime I try to give people a chance at letting me know I'm important. I tell people weeks in advance that my birthday is coming up, I practically beg people to do something for it, and they agree. Hooray, they care. And then it doesn't happen. They say sorry, im tired. Sorry, I'm busy. That's fine. You're never tired or busy for your other friends. And they never have been. They always pull through for thr other vital members of the group. Each and every one of them pull through for each and every one of the others. To be clear, I was never \"in\" this group. Just tiptoeing in. Trying to.

Am I a spoiled child throwing a tantrum when I can't get something impossible? Is being alone really too much to ask for?\n\nI just don't get it. I've heard people say that emotions ruin everything good but I don't understand what that means for me. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to feel? Happy every second? Every day? Every month?\n\nI want to believe that some people just snap one day and can't regulate their emotions anymore. Like when Forrest Hump starts running.

Working out, meditation, eating less,drinking more water, getting out the house with friends, school full time, and work. \nI did all that at once for a year. If you’re thinking that’s not a long time, I have BPD and it’s extremely hard for me. My BPD makes me so fucking insufferable to be around. My intentions never match my actions. I think it’s a mix of things, my BPD, MDD, PTSD & anxiety of course, but also I’m in a constant state of survival. I live with my boyfriend, who doesn’t treat me right and doesn’t have any ambition in life doesn’t work or go to school. His mom constantly kicks us out because of his behavior, which negatively impacts me because I’m doing everything I can. If ur thinking just leave, I have. It’s hard when ur in school full time and suffering with mental health turmoil. I feel like I can’t do it anymore. I’ve dropped everything that isn’t absolutely necessary. I shower every other day, don’t drink water, eat too much to fill the void. I can’t do anything I want to do anymore. When I felt the onset of this episode, I told my “best friend” about it. She tried to be supportive and just said that I need to be around people. But I couldn’t, I have to take a break and I did. I stopped going around my friends because I needed a financial break from them (hanging out with them is expensive & if I keep not paying they’re going to talk shit. Not to my face, but the way they talk about others is like they’re indirectly telling me something) and they stopped talking to me completely. I tried to hang out with her 3 times and every time there was an excuse so I left the ball in her court. Just doing that took a lot of energy so I was done after 3 tries. I feel like they saw right through my fake front that I’m confident or normal.\nI feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders.

And to make things worse, my only support is 24 hours away driving, so if I do leave my boyfriend for my mental health, I give up nursing school. I’ve tried getting a dorm, too expensive. I asked for increased financial aid to cover the dorm or I’ll be homeless and they told me everyone who applies to dorm needs it. Not being very helpful at all. I reached out to my church, and they haven’t answered back yet but o feel like I’m at a dead end. Also , if I want to transfer my school to my parents, I’d have to wait longer and I’m on my last semester I just want to get it done. Also, I hate where my parents live I get seasonal depression so so bad but I pretend I’m fine because what else am I going to do. I feel like my life is just meant to be like everyone else, sad and miserable. Working towards something greater is just so out of reach.

I hated the family that I was born into and I hated what I saw in the mirror.\n\nI was ashamed of my family because there was no redeeming them from their stupid cult religion. I was ashamed of myself because I looked like then and my behaviour was poor in school. I humiliated myself countless times, and these were not small embarrassment. These were poor choices with heavy consequences that I am still, to this day at the age of 30, paying for. I never had friends because I didn't fit in with anyone and people didn't respect me for good reason. My childhood was a waste and my adolescence was traumatizing.\n\nNow I'm an adult and I achieved the things I set out to achieve when I was 25. I live on my own, I've done some traveling, I have 2 jobs, I've separated myself from my family, I changed my name and moved to a different city. \n\nBut nothing has changed. In fact, I feel worse than I ever have at any point of my life. I solved the pressing problems but I came to the realization that I am the problem. Nothing I accomplish will change what I am. I will always be the same person no matter what I call myself, where I go, what I buy, or who I surround myself with. There is nothing I can do to fundamentally change the fact that I hate myself to the core. \n\nI hate my skin and my race, I hate my appearance, I hate my upbringing, I hate my voice, I hate the way I think, I hate the fact that I feel inferior around others, I hate the fact that I don't enjoy anything in life, I hate my memories, I hate the way I've been treated and the way people see me. I can't change the choices I've made and there is no future for myself that I feel would be worth living.
