My mental energy waivers as I write, so who tf knows.\n\nI suppose at my core, I am a creature of flesh and fiction. Stories are what have created and continue to evolve the world around us, whether they be fiction or non. To semi-paraphrase Hamlet, the stage is but a mirror of human nature. \n\nI find more connection to fiction than I ever have in reality, which perhaps has been my own downfall in further internalizing myself. Anyways, I love Phantom of the Opera, the Witcher, DC Comics, War & Peace and a bajillion other things stemming from literature, film or theatre. The list goes on, for there is still so much to uncover.\n\nMusic is a great comfort for me too, as I imagine it is for most. My preferred genres ranged greatly, though I frequent classical, opera, musicals, jazz and basically anything that isn’t rap, hip-hop, country nor whatever modern pop is (I do like some, but it varies). I’m always open to experimenting and finding new musical interests, though.\n\nI dabble with instruments, though I find it difficult to discipline myself in practicing consistently. Currently I play the cello, though I have dabbled with a handful of others, such as the concertina and mandolin. I like to collect them, even if I don’t properly take the time to play them (neglectful, I know).\n\nI’ve never really thought of myself as an artsy person, but I enjoy embroidery on the odd occasion. I’ve been periodically working on this decomposing hand for far longer than it should take, but distractions are a constant.\n\nI enjoy gaming too, though I would like to find more meaningful ways to spend my days. It’s hard to break away from something that has been the sole source of much companionship or comfort, though. That being said, I do enjoy playing games with others and forming bonds with them. It’s, admittedly, much easier to have a shared task to focus on that can alleviate some pressure with communication. \n\nMy social skills seem to vary from person to person, though perhaps that’s on the frequencies between others and how easily they click. I want to feel comfortable to both joke around and have deeper conversations. Sometimes I feel trapped within my head with people, never sure how to respond or reciprocate conversation. \n\nBack to games, it really varies on my mood and the style of game itself. From Outlast Trials (trust in the therapy) to Snail Simulator, there isn’t much of a theme with me. I love collecting achievements through Steam, for whatever reason beyond satisfaction and being able to off. I’m currently working through the Witcher 3 (again, but achievement hunting) and Hello Kitty Island Adventure (which I didn’t think I would be this drawn to but alas).\n\nMore random shitooski’s:\nI’ve recently discovered a natural talent for cooking, which has been quite interesting.  \nWhile I respect some people’s need for religion in their life, I am in no way religious and prefer to step around it when I can (past stuff, I suppose).\n\nAnyways that’s me in a nutshell. If anyone resonates with anything and would like to play a game or something, let me know.

But I feel like I’m on the verge of losing my sh!t and need to vent. I went to the gym for an hour and still feel manic. \n\nI’ve been through some shit, like everyone else. Last year I got in contact with another female who was attacked by the same person I was. He started seeing her 2 weeks after he put me in the hospital for internal bleeding. Mind you, he was my friend for 8 years before we dated for about a year. The other woman had known him and his family since high school and she got it WAY WORSE. I mean this guy almost killed my dog in front of me and she showed me a picture of this bite mark he left on her and you could see each individual tooth mark. I mean, why?!\n\nAnyways, she called me on Christmas to give me an update. He’s being charged with 2 felonies and got denied any “mental health” and “first felony forgiveness” programs. So it means the state is actually going to hold him accountable. I daydream about visiting him in prison just to rub it in his face, but I feel like that would just reintroduce the nightmares. Still debating…\n\nI currently live with my now ex boyfriend. He was the first person I dated since my abusive ex and I can’t even explain what it’s like to watch yourself become the red flag because of all the trauma your body is holding. I broke it off because I was losing my mind. I couldn’t heal while hurting someone else, I needed to just focus on me. He’s so kind and patient with me. He’s still my best friend and dotes on me. I do my best to support him and make him feel welcomed and happy in our home. But I know my pain seeps out like a poisonous gas. \n\nLet’s introduce my friend of 4 years. There’s always been some sexual tension, but nothing has ever come of it. I see him like 3 times a year and we always go on like all day adventures doing random shit. I went out with him the week I was planning on ending things with my now ex. I ended up getting drunk and spending the night. We just made out, clothes still on, keeping the hands PG, and cuddled all intertwined the whole night. I hadn’t felt that comfortable and at peace with another human like that in YEARS. I cried in my car because I didn’t want to leave his place and then I cried on my way home because I knew me not coming home probably killed my boyfriend. I broke up with him that week and told him everything. He said it was okay and we didn’t need to end things, but it wasn’t okay with me and I knew that I cheated because I was unhappy in our relationship and that wasn’t fair for either of us.\n\nSo my friend travels back home for work a lot, different state, and we barely texted during our friendship (only to make plans, no chit chat). He texted me everyday he was gone and then asked me to pick him up from the airport so we could hang out. I wanted to so bad, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I would be hurting my ex and I didn’t want that. I was honest with my friend about it and he got upset. We were able to talk through it, but I ended up asking for space to think through things.\n\nA month went by and now it’s the beginning of December, I figured that was a good amount of time..? I let him know I would have some time off in mid January to hang out and he agreed to meet up. A week later I sent him a Merry Christmas text and got left on read. I was a little hurt and let it be, but that’s not all.\n\nRemember I got a phone call from the other victim of our abuser to get an update on his hearing. I got left on read, and then I got grabbed by a stranger when I went to the movies and he tried to drag me out of the theater… and what hurts me the most is getting left on read. WTF?\n\nI’m like so done. I’m saying all this to provide perspective on my mind. I haven’t even included the work drama. But I haven’t heard anything from him. At this point I just want my friend back, but I’m also starting to get angry that he left me on read and I’m afraid I’ll let my Leo side shine if he ever texts me back. \n\nI want to block him, but I can’t tell if I’m just over stimulated or sincerely need to just let him out of my life because it’s too messy. He knows what I’ve been through and is also understanding. But like I miss that feeling of being comfortable enough to accept physical touch, which I didn’t even have with my ex. I don’t know what to do. I wish I could zap myself with the MIB memory wiper. \n\nAny advice or harsh judgements to help me grow is welcomed. \n\nSincerely,\nCrazed and Confused", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonelyTogether/comments/1hutwst/ngb_i_just_might_be_insane/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonelyTogether/comments/1hutwst/ngb_i_just_might_be_insane/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I feel like I do not have a lot in common with all the people in my carreer, at least not enough to hang out or anything like that, I guess that the fact that I am practically the only guy there is a big influence to that feeling.
