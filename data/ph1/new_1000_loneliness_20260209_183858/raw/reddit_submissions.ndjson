Because I've completely lost faith and hope that such a thing exists anywhere...\n\n\n\nI most sincerely ask the moderation not to reject my post. Give me a chance to express the storm that has engulfed my heart and soul. Thank you!\n\n\n\nI feel like John Coffey. Struck by the pain of reality. Overwhelmed by people, by their bad behavior towards each other, by the cruel scenarios they drag everything living into. By the torture of souls and bodies.\n\n\n\nDo you know what it's like? I don't just see it. I feel it. I cry. I'm torn apart from within. And there's no one to hear me. There's no one even to talk to, because people are indoctrinated to talk only about mundane things — work, career, entertainment, possessions...\n\n\n\nThe world I'm forced to exist in, not by choice but by compulsion, is so brutal and burns me so much that it's hard for me to even put this feeling into words, but despite everything, I will try.\n\n\n\nEvery day is violence. Every hour, moment, second — pain. I ask myself several times a day how it's possible for an entire humanity to function in such an inhumane and primitive way. How?!\n\n\n\nI am a man from Bulgaria, almost 37 years old. The fourth decade is approaching since I've been here, on this condemned planet. In this span of time, I've seen so much bitterness, so much sorrow, so much fear... and I still see and endure all of this... in abundance.\n\n\n\nI haven't seen a bright day in this messed-up life, which is anything but life.\n\nI am subjected to economic, social, and all kinds of exclusion. Invisible to women, to my state, to everything that exists.\n\n\n\nThe rare occasions when someone pretends to notice me and establishes some contact with me, not long after, open demonic behavior begins — behavior of superiority, domination, and authoritarianism. Behavior that deeply hurts me, and when I try to explain this — I receive aggression against myself.\n\n\n\nFrom everywhere, I hear that 'it's my fault' and that 'no one owes me anything,' that my human essence has no value in itself, and the only thing that would make me visible to someone is if I am well-positioned in this world. With a profession. With money. With charisma and charm (imposed standards). Otherwise, I am written off and declared insolvent.\n\n\n\nMany men around the world experience this. Mostly young. But already desperate. Because no one sees them, no one sees their pains and struggles, nor shows even elementary interest in their needs. The violence is pervasive, deadly, global.\n\n\n\nIt's no different with women. But there, the specifics are different. For them, unification consists of being turned into trophies to be conquered, and cosmetic and plastic surgery, media, and social networks constantly bombard them with propaganda about how they should look to be 'marketable' in the relationship market.\n\n\n\nThat's why they become increasingly artificial, but also increasingly arrogant. Because the matrix of materialism and consumerism has made them think they have a vast sea of choices of all kinds of men at any given moment, while at the same time, a not-insignificant percentage of normal and sensitive men (there are already statistics on male loneliness and isolation) literally perish in oblivion and even commit suicide — some do it slowly through depression, addictions, and other ways, while others quickly and directly.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of world is this that constantly reproduces all this darkness of horrors, violence, and exploitation? What else is it but psychotic and cursed?\n\nGovernments feed on pain. On human alienation. On divisions and moral collapse in states and among nations.\n\n\n\nInstitutions, the press, and authorities are in the hands of total psychopaths with openly maniacal and sick ambitions, as the legendary John Lennon says. They create technologies for climate change, gender change (even in children), abortions, green deals, mass surveillance, digital currencies, and all sorts of other absurdities, aiming to disrupt the natural order and appearance of human beings (and communities)...\n\n\n\nBut no one deals with world hunger, as a result of which millions of people die every year. In some areas of our planet, children look like skeletons, have no access to clean drinking water, and are grateful even for a cup of rice a day. While in other regions (USA, for example), burger-eating contests are held. Food is wasted... What is this, if not madness?\n\n\n\nThe world spends TRILLIONS on military purposes and armaments. But says it has no resources to feed the hungry and provide for all living organisms?! Do you understand what a horror of horrors this is?!\n\n\n\nNot to mention intentional and mass migration, the transformation of white countries into ghettos, the humiliation that indigenous European peoples and cultures endure and are subjected to. For religious extremism and wars... In the name of religion, profit, conquest.\n\n\n\nAll of this burns me when I see it, feel it, and realize it. No, I don't just state facts... I feel it as wounds on my own body. This is killing me. Systematically. Methodically. Every day... And every night.\n\n\n\nAs long as I can remember, I've lived on the edge of survival. In a world that talks about abundance and space travel, I am deprived of even the most basic human needs — food, hot water, peace. Even on cold winter days, I have to roam the streets and collect some scraps to survive another messed-up day.\n\n\n\nI also collect cigarette butts from street bins and bus stops. So I have something to smoke, because my nerves can't take it otherwise. Every day is a struggle for survival. And I don't know what life in the true sense of the word is.\n\n\n\nI lie down and wake up feeling tired, with body aches, my teeth are crumbling, my heart tightens, my head spins. I've experienced panic attacks, phobia of people, fear of persecution, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and depression since I was 9-10 years old. That's more than 20 years in this horror. Without the possibility of treatment, deliverance, or an exit.\n\n\n\nI have repeatedly been at the mercy of the streets... I know what cold, hunger, rain, fear, and a sense of doom are. I've also been to hospitals (psychiatric), where I witnessed another dose of violence, and where I clearly saw that people are not cured. They just get sicker there. No one cares about them. Even less the staff... Everything is upside down.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I inhabit a small and miserable attic room in a seaside town in Bulgaria. I am grateful to have a roof over my head, but it's as much a roof as it is my personal cell. Because I have no peace from the noise and reckless behavior of the roommates from the other rooms.\n\n\n\nBecause I don't even have basic conditions to maintain my needs and hygiene normally. And because no one cares what happens to me and how I'm falling apart.\n\nThis city is too dangerous, and the streets abound with hooligans who shout, behave aggressively, and create tension. And every time I have to go out, it's a real nightmare for me. When I return to my room, I cross myself before the icon, with gratitude that I survived today. But I don't know how long I can...\n\n\n\nI pay for this apartment with partial assistance, and when I pay my rent + electricity and water, almost nothing is left for me, and again I have to survive with whatever I find on the streets, if I find anything at all. From this, my body weakens more and more. It shows me in every way that it cannot and does not want to be tortured in such a way anymore, and I am forced to torment it... and I cannot give it the rest and peace it desperately needs.\n\n\n\nWill you tell me to seek help? Do you think I haven't tried? Since the distant years of 2010-2011, I've been alarming about my situation. I write in newspapers, groups, websites. I've been to public organizations. Do you know what happens? No response from anywhere. And the rare cases when there was some... it was very temporary and short-lived. And then I'm told the familiar 'I need to pull myself together' and go work something, otherwise, life is impossible.\n\n\n\nNo one asks how, with these pains, with this panic, with this anxiety and sense of horror when among people, I could cope? How? No one knows what's happening in my body and psyche. And that as soon as I have an attack, terrible nausea and vomiting begin — sometimes of stomach acid.\n\n\n\nAs soon as women find out about my situation, they just disappear. There isn't even a girl I can go out with for a walk, or have a coffee. I'm not a person to them. Because they don't see a 'man' in me according to the imposed criteria, but they see a burden they don't want to bother with. They demand the impossible, but don't even give the most basic support, loyalty, and love...\n\n\n\nSo many lost years already. From my youth. Over 20 years of fruitless searching for the most natural things here — love, support, selflessness, meaning, loyalty. They are gone. The most natural is the hardest to find.\n\n\n\nAnd everything is tied to money. Even the right to love and be loved, the right to create relationships — the virus of money has penetrated there too. People look at each other as market products in catalogs, not as souls, as the great Creator made us.\n\n\n\nHow can I exist here? Please tell me!\n\nWhere is my place? Where are my kindred spirits?\n\nWhere is mercy?\n\n\n\nI feel that if all this continues... and if I don't find a way and a chance very soon to leave here and start somewhere fresh, anew... I will destroy myself.\n\nI want to find peace and a place that is not a cell, but a home. I want to heal, to create and build. To love and be loved!\n\nI DO NOT want to just exist, to work, to be a cog in the matrix wheel.\n\n\n\nMy soul is here with a completely different meaning and purpose.\n\n\n\nNo human being here, nor animal, should live in conditions of deprivation, fear, and humiliation. Not one. Never. Under any circumstances. This is a fundamental principle for me. Because life is before any economy! Before any damned human stereotypical cliché.\n\n\n\nAnd right now, I again have to think about how to get what no living creature should lack — food.\n\n\n\nNot to mention that over the years I saw with my own eyes how homeless people are left to die on city benches. While 'law enforcement officers' mock them and consider them a burden.\n\n\n\nThat's all from me. For now.\n\n\n\nWhile one percent of the super-rich (a parasitic layer) live in glass capsules and bathe with gold dust shampoos, own private islands and planes... at the same time, millions of other creatures perish in loneliness, deprivation, and misery. Because the same authorities only think of themselves and their personal selfishness.\n\n\n\nQuote to end:\n\n\n\n'Doctors, lawyers, judges — they all make money.

I was obviously hurt by this but I thought I still had my best friend, J, so I was grateful to at least have her. We had a rough patch in December but I thought we were fine after we talked it out and we went out to dinner and had a good time just before New Year's. But for the last month or so J won't talk to me much. I asked if she was okay and she said her family was having some health problems so I expressed my sympathies and told her I was here for her if she needed anything and I thought we were fine. I've tried talking to her numerous times and she reads my messages and doesn't respond. I have a really great opportunity coming up this next week, I lost a long time beloved family friend to cancer this past week, and work has been h**l on earth and I just want to talk to my best friend. I totally understand she's got her own issues going on and I sympathize with her and I want to be there for her. I'm just feeling really alone right now...\n\nSorry for the long post, I just needed to vent.

Feminism has been (and continues to be) incredibly important to grant equal rights and opportunities to women. Sadly we're not there yet everywhere in the world, but I hope that this will be the case eventually.\n\nWith that being said, the future for young, average men looks grim.

The majority of the women I know are totally content with being single their entire lives - but almost no man I know thinks the same.

She never asked for money but used the same lies, the same inconsistencies, expressing romantic feelings, saying she would come to my country for a job, and much more than that (deepfakes, AI, etc.).

I can find “wyd” at 1 a.m. like it’s a personality trait.\nBut the thing I’m starving for is the kind of connection where someone actually wants to know you—not just the version of you that’s easy, funny, agreeable, or hot.\nIt’s like we all say we want connection… and then the moment someone asks a real question—values, fears, what you actually want, what broke you, what you’re building—people slam the door and call it “privacy,” or they dodge, deflect, go silent, or pivot to sex because that’s safer than being seen.\nAnd yeah, I’m touch-starved too. But sex isn’t the first hunger.\nThe first hunger is being met.\nThe first hunger is someone staying in the conversation long enough for the real stuff to show up.\nAlso—why do people act like distance is the main reason something can’t be real? Since when did “miles” matter more than character? You can be in the same room with someone and still be alone. You can be across the world from someone and feel more understood in one hour than you’ve felt in years.\nI’m not asking for a fairytale. I’m not asking for someone to save me. I’m asking if anybody still believes in connection that isn’t negotiable, isn’t performative, isn’t a debate—just real. The kind where two people are honest enough to be known.\nIf you feel this kind of loneliness—\nthe chest-ache kind, the “nothing touches it” kind—what helps?\nAnd if you’ve ever found real depth with someone (friend or partner), \nwhat made it different?\nBecause I’m tired of living on crumbs.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qydjdw/im_not_just_lonely_but_starving/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qydjdw/im_not_just_lonely_but_starving/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Now it just feels like someone who meant the entire world to me and claimed he felt the same didn't take a second to walk away from it all, instantly. \nAnd if I'm being fair I did attempt suicide last year in month of June and I think that rattled him. He tried to break up with me the very next night and when I begged him to stay he did. But his actions completly changed towards me. He became cruel and cold. \n\nEver since I have been extremely lonely and have been trying to cope with it with some unhealthy mechanisms. With what I am doing right now I can see myself going down the path of alcohol abuse and ending up killing myself in one way or another. With every passing day the thought of dying brings some sort of comfort and a fragile sense of comfort. I figure this is not normal but I'm told everyone has suicidal thoughts and that everyone grows tired of living but push on regardless. Am I thinking too much into it or am I over analysing/ thinking?

Scary. What if something happens out there? \n\nWhat’s worse is when you feel like it’s the middle of nowhere in your everyday life. Can you imagine? Going to work, talking to coworkers, seeing your family, reading books to your own children, living like you are words on a page of a warm novel. It looks nice in that way from the outside, but feels another way on the inside. I can’t just imagine it, I live it. Today I told my wife I have an empty tank, and an empty mind. I went on to tell her, “My heart’s not empty yet, but I feel like it’s getting there.” \n\nWhat’s wrong with me? \n\nI figured that out. I figured that out while I was still up the creek. Since then I’ve drifted down enough to have nothing surrounding me. Into an abyss, like an ocean. No shore to offer any hope of survival. It’s lonely. Been scared a long time. I’ve drifted far, and it’s getting dark. \n\nHow did I end up in the creek you say? It was an accident. I would take it back if I could. I made a mistake. I told her something that was hurtful, although I meant it to be helpful. When I said it, I had good intentions, at least that’s what I remember. It’s been along time. It takes a long time to drift into an ocean. When I said it, I think it sounded a little abrasive. It did not come off as an altruistic comment to my wife, but rather, mean. I had pointed a gun at my own head just an hour before. That I do remember. It didn’t feel right. \n\nI don’t remember the exact words but, I told her I thought she should help with her horses more. She could go take care of them while I took care of the baby. \n\nLife hasn’t been the same since. That was 9 years ago. My words were the catalyst to a death sentence. The death to our marriage, possibly my life. I thought it would give her an opportunity to get away from everything, and do something independent. \n\nNo words. Then the fighting started. Went on a few years, until we both became numb enough to just live life on auto pilot. Lots of life, no personality. Finding joy is like finding a glimmer of sunlight in January. Rare. \n\nIt hurts so bad. I feel like she was just waiting for her opportunity to strike me down, and cut me off. I don’t get any affection. She puts work and kids over our marriage 100% of the time, and always has a million and one excuses to not come close me. \n\nIt’s over. The ocean is cold, and it’s dark out here. My heart needs to grow two sizes, but I have no sunshine, no food for my soul. When something is really hard, I can’t count on my wife being there for me in all the ways I need her. It leaves such a big hole. I feel like a straw. Everything just sucking through my empty vessel; work, kids, commute, family, vacations, phone calls, texts. \n\nEmpty.

It strips the world of excess until only absence remains, an absence I have yet to decipher, sitting beside me in complete silence long past midnight. There is something unsettling about that hour, when the world feels suspended, as though even time has agreed to pause and observe.\n\nI sit in that stillness where thought finally loosens its grip. The mind, exhausted from its constant insistence on meaning, falls quiet. And in that quiet, feelings arrive, unannounced, uninvited, as if they had been waiting patiently for the noise to die down. They move in softly, but with weight, filling the empty space thoughts once occupied.\n\nIt is in those moments that I realize how deliberately I wear my solitude like armor shaped from bleakness and desolation. I’ve learned to stand within it, even to take pride in it. There is a strange vastness here, an almost infinite stretch of inner space that solitude affords, and for a while it feels enough. It feels self-contained. Whole.\n\nBut then the feelings linger.\n\nAnd slowly, they begin to expose the truth beneath the armor: that this vastness is not freedom alone, but distance. That this quiet is not just peace, but loneliness. In their presence, I feel suddenly unguarded as though the identity I forged through wounds, through endured truths and confronted shadows, is no longer solid but trembling. It is a terrifying realization: that something so carefully constructed, so painfully earned, can feel so fragile in the face of emptiness.\n\nThese moments do not scream, they rush to erode. They make me question not who I am, but how easily even a hardened sense of self can feel at risk of dissolving. The loneliness doesn’t attack, it waits and that is what makes it unbearable.\n\nStill, no matter the weight of it, I know this much: I will not surrender myself to momentary relief. I will not trade the integrity of my being for the temporary comfort these feelings demand. They may linger, they may ache, they may threaten to unmake me but they will not dictate my actions.\n\nSo I endure, for endurance is not a choice, it is the condition under which I remain myself.\n\n", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qu7lw7/emptiness_past_midnight/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qu7lw7/emptiness_past_midnight/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Y'all giving up on yourselves due to loneliness. Let me be blunt here. Most of the time friendships suck. They're temporary and short. The reality is that nobody is going to be ever there for you if you aren't either mentally healthy, successful, stable or physically healthy. You don't need to be famous or wealthy in a typical sense. Most friendships stay due to stability and forced similar circumstances not because of loyalty, love, care or whatever else. Having a friendship isn't some magical thing. It's time consuming, dramatic, painful and there are too many expectations around friendships. \n\nRelationships are the same, but with a different flavour. Those convincing you that their friendships lasted for decades don't realise that their friendships lasted for decades because of forced similar cirumstances or stability. \n\nThe best thing that all of you can do for yourselves is to value yourselves and have some self-respect. Loneliness stings, but it's not the end of the world. I'd say that being lonely is better than being surrounded by people anyway. Love doesn't exist and those are chemicals. Work on yourselves. Grind. Do the best for yourselves. Of course, don't become toxic or bitter. Value growth, knowledge and skills. If people come into your life, good, if they don't then fuck them. \n\n", "score": 0, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qu7dqc/for_the_lonely_people_in_the_back/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qu7dqc/for_the_lonely_people_in_the_back/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

For me, this means: no desire for sexual or romantic relationships.\n\nAt the same time, I have a strong need for closeness in a non-sexual sense (e.g., talking, being together, cuddling). This is where my inner conflict arises:\n\nI am very afraid of loneliness because many social relationships are strongly defined by romance or sexuality. At the same time, I fear that my need for closeness might overwhelm others, manipulate them, or unintentionally cross boundaries—even when I clearly communicate that it’s nothing sexual and that a “no” is always respected.\n\nI often think about whether I “deserve” closeness, whether I’m even allowed to ask for it, or if I should suppress my need in order not to put anyone in an uncomfortable situation.\nAdditionally, I struggle with inner restlessness, phases of derealization, and anxiety, which makes everything even more complicated.\n\nMy questions to you:\nAre there people here who feel something similar (ace/aro or in general)?\nHow do you deal with closeness without putting pressure on yourself or others?

Hear me out.\n\n\nWe have built a random video and text chat platform called Vooz which can help you talk to anyone and befriend them. You can just hop into Vooz co, enter some hobbies or interests of yours and get matched with similar strangers right away. You can choose to video or text chat, whatever you are comfortable with. You can even add your fav persons to your friendlist to reconnect later. If you don't like someone, just skip them for the next user. There are a lot of group chatrooms too fyi.\n\n\r\nThis is not your typical Omegle or other chat site. We focused highly on making the chat experience the best out of all other platforms. The platform is AI moderated and permanently bans NSFW users. The matching is super fast, takes a few seconds to pair you with someone, all real people. You can also use the gender or location filters in case you want a more customised pairing.\n\n\nLike we said, Vooz is not your average chat platform. We are live since a year now with 250k monthly users. We can honestly help you make genuine friends and beat that loneliness.

Of course, there is limited evidence that any of the solutions provided by either the male or female centered self help gurus and influencers had any real effect in improving the situation. In a lot of cases, there isin't anything fundamentally wrong with a lot of the single men in question. They come in different shapes and sizes, are of different backgrounds, religions and political affiliations and economic backgrounds. Women have certain( often vaguely defined) expectations that they hear from their online gurus and male brains are not wired to even understand those expectations nevermind actually meet them. It is therefore reasonable to assume that more and more young people( and perhaps some not so young if i may say) will stay long term single.\n\nWhilst discussing this topic there is often a focus on the single man's grief, single woman's dissopoitments of her expectations not being met before reaffirming that they are still non negotiable and people of both genders sharing their experiences on how to ' cope' with loneliness.  There are plenty of woman channels who encourage other women to celebrate being single and engage in activities( like travelling solo or engaging social groups, suppoury groups ect) to help the women thrive.\n\nAnd so I would like to explore this: what could the great majority of single men with no dating prospects do to not just cope with their situation but also thrive?  What positive things can they engage in? Women have their groups to help them out- what is the equivalent for men? What networks could be created to facilitate this?\n\nI think it's an important topic. Its often said that men are in 'crisis' which is actually very stigmatising. Men are in a difficult position due to no fault of their own( impact of technology and changing social norms).  The  societal changes that we have seen are very rapid, and one would typically expect hunderds of years to adjust . We do not have that much time though. Its an unprecendent time in history.\n\nPreferably I would like to hear answers from both men and women.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 22, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qnpo1q/how_can_the_young_generation_of_permanently/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qnpo1q/how_can_the_young_generation_of_permanently/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I hope you all believe in yourselves, even if no one else will.

I guess at the time high school sweetheart and first love that started ever since middle school and during those 5 years It was only good for the first year being in middle school 8th grade and summer but once high school came around we were... Volatile. I was self loathing, self aware and depressed empty and utterly devoid of any pride or self love. I genuinely believed any person who could breathe was profoundly more worthy and valued than I could ever be. I hated and despised myself for a multitude of reasons stemming from childhood abuse from my father thus... because I couldn't love myself... I was a horrible boyfriend. Perhaps the worst even despite starting the relationship vowing internally to be the best boyfriend I could be. I guess that's an example of the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I didn't know any better at the time yet I've never said that as an excuse. She was no saint either but that never justified what I did or who I was in that relationship. I take full accountability for who I was and what I did but nowadays reflect so much on every detail in the past that I personally felt responsible for and continue to learn.\n\nAnyway during that relationship I was cheated on 3 times. I was an asshole and honestly pathetic but I never cheated once, nor did I ever consider it. She however... did. I understood why she did what she did and although I can't blame her, I still wish she ended things with me before doing so. This was in our Sophomore year of highschool? I was being the worst around this time deep into my insecurities and so she was mostly with her friends in these times and there was volleyball games going on competing against other schools and during these volleyball games a guy that was much charming, much kinder, and honestly? I couldn't possibly hate. He approached her because she was attractive I suppose. I don't really know much about him, Anyway he treated her like an angel and of course compare that to the volatile boyfriend she had at home she chose to let that relationship bloom somewhat, but in secret. Me being my self-absorbed, self-sabotaging. self-destructive and emotionally volatile person I was, had been able to feel something was wrong with how distant she was becoming during texts. It all culminated in waiting for her at her house, in her room, out of sheer desperation that I could feel deep in my bones, was the end of our relationship. I was waiting in that room for her while she was in the volleyball games and honestly? Definitely my most suicidal state internally. Emotionally so intense I genuinely wouldn't have hesitated if she ended things with me, then I'd be dead...in hindsight now, I... yeah I know.\n\nIt's just around this time I felt so alone, I never had friends. Never had family to talk to this stuff about and felt completely broken. I felt like I was nothing, less than air or dust. I was unlovable and ugly inside and out. It was self-loathing born ever since I was a child. My biological father... he broke my teeth when I was a kid. I think I accidentally broke one button on a TV set and he took a broom stick thick and heavy and swung it at my jaw, I remember blood dripping out my mouth, I remember a tooth flying out, but what I remember most was the image when I looked in the mirror. I was 8. Jaw open and fuck was it ugly. I grew quiet, dead silent at the time and kept to myself closing my mouth utterly afraid to ever talk... because honestly? I didn't want to bother anyone with my ugly teeth even as a kid. I wanted to be considerate even If I was nothing. It soon festered and only got worse with time and as that childhood trauma festered. It only got worse and perhaps magnified tenfold as I was facing isolation and depression waiting for her to come back from the volleyball games.\n\nAnyway when she did eventually came home and saw me... she was normal. She didn't change or be weird. She wasn't cold or distant at all. Completely and utterly normal that my heart nor mind never suspected anything was wrong honestly. As she reassured me that our relationship was completely fine and that she loved me completely, I believed her and we slept together cuddling peacefully... However my gut didn't believe her so I awoke in the middle of the night and glanced at her phone. Luckily or perhaps Unluckily I knew her password and she did mine. So I snuck out of the bed and stared at the phone completely oblivious to what I would find. At first, I hated myself for even considering the idea, to even check and be paranoid and controlling like that. But my gut was so heavy and it was nauseating to ignore so I just suck it up and opened the phone hating myself more while doing it at first because I saw nothing. It was normal. Normal texts between friends, family, and school stuff... Until... I opened tiktok. This woman was flirting, planning dates, and genuinely enjoying a secret romance with the dude I described earlier.  \nIt broke me.\n\nI woke her up and asked her about the messages and she tried to deny it, play it cool. Tried to convince me I was overreacting, that it was nothing. However I did manage to make her acknowledge after reading it with me message by message and seeing the hurt in my face or perhaps just tired of my shit accepted that it was bad what she did to me. Bizarrely looking back now, I don't think she really cared. I say this because I remember her being unfazed and completely nonchalant the entire time. Anyway, I made her block and delete the guy on tiktok and that was that. We grew more intimate and I loved her more from it despite everything and what I felt internally... it was so good then it wasn't. She became more irritated with me, she was annoyed more often, she was cold as ice and I had no idea why completely naive and believing that it had nothing to do with the guy and trusting her completely. A few weeks later as the volleyball games were still ongoing unbeknownst to me she was still in contact with the guy and it was so much worse. Much worse now.\n\nIt was in the middle of class when she texted me in her cold and more distant way asking to borrow my hoodie and I of course gave it to her but as she left then came back not wearing the hoodie, she gave it to me and when she sat down afar, I was in my own bubble engrossed in my thoughts trying to understand why she was so cold... then she texted me the words... \"I don't think we can work\" and \"I have to find myself\" and finally \"We're done and I'm sorry\". She even hit me with the \"It's not you, It's me. I'm so sorry\". I was devastated. I was lost. I was nothing. I didn't do any dramatic or crazy outburst. I just stayed silent, quiet in my own seat in class. No one cared of course because I lacked friends and why would anyone know my pain if I never communicated it right? I was convinced and felt genuinely ashamed to voice my problems or insecurities to anyone believing that bothering anyone to me... was akin to death. It was so terrifying for me, the prospect of bothering anyone who were so above me or so I believed subconsciously was honestly dreadful. I couldn't do it or maybe I refused to do so. So I was alone. Without anyone and definitely not the person I loved either. I tried to reach out to people who I knew ever since but... they didn't really care. I was... I don't even know. I never so alone, so hollow, so empty, so depressed, so insignificant in my life.\n\nConsidering those factors... I made one of the worst decisions of my life and begged her to try again. I came back to her room, at her house a week or 2 later when I couldn't handle the loneliness further and I cleaned her room while waiting for her. She came back surprised of course, she literally broke up with me a week or 2 beforehand and here I am her ex in her room like a fucking psychopath stalker or at least that's what I thought. She on the other hand was nonchalant as fuck about it. She just asked why I was there and what is all this. That's when I begged, pleaded, and tried to convince her to not let it end like that. She agreed for reasons I'm unable to process now. You have to understand, I was so pathetic. If I was in her shoes, I would have never took me back. Anyway we were good at least to me. I was unaware the entire time with her and the dude and just loved her or at least I tried to in my own way given my internal self-sabotaging traits. I met her dad and we pretty much stayed at his place together, yeah we were wilding or at least I was honestly. I lowkey felt ashamed to stay there like live there but she never seemed to care and wanted me there so I accepted. I thought it was all good and actually bonded with her dad's side of the family or at least with her dad personally... of course that didn't last long. I checked her phone once again because of my gut feeling and there was nothing. However I did find she suddenly was friends with a bunch of dudes that she wasn't friends with beforehand. I was completely confused and kept looking further and yeah just like that reading the convos between them all, they were the friends of the dude she was romancing with in secret hiding from me.\n\nI was done... man. I just couldn't anymore.\n\nSo I threatened her and completely bluffed that I had all the evidence and I was going to text the dude that didn't even know about me her boyfriend and once she believed my threat, she lost all nonchalance. It was such a complete cognitive dissonance. She.... fucking loved that dude but never said it directly. She was trying to protect him from me, she didn't want him to find out anything. I was completely lost. I couldn't fathom the sheer stupid predicament I was in. It was genuinely comedic how horrid it all was. She told me about how done dirty he was by his ex and she genuinely looked at me as if I was supposed to agree and feel bad for said dude. WHATHEFUCK?. She confessed, she kissed the guy and made out with him in HIS place watching our favorite show vampire diaries, she went on fucking dates with him in his car. Hell NAH... I tried to leave immediately, I couldn't do this shit anymore and I was so annihilated internally, heartbroken? More like shattered, obliterated. Soul crushed? More like torn, split and completely destroyed. I wanted to die. I wanted anything other than her. This shit was all sophomore year. Looking back, I'm in shock but let's keep going. She stopped me immediately, I have no idea why. Maybe she genuinely loved me or maybe she felt so guilty or both? I have no idea but she begged and pleaded for another chance. She told me it was nothing, told me she loved me...\n\nI couldn't accept nor reject her in the moment and needed time and space above all, away from her. I wanted to leave the place so bad, remember this is her dad's house. WHY WOULD I WANNA BE THERE BRUH? But shit she was good at making me stay, despite apparently feeling guilty she threatened to wake them up and tell them everything. She knew I hated, borderline despised bothering anyone and did not want to bother her dad who I developed a bond with. So despite literally every single thing telling me to leave? I stayed... fuck. It was horrible, not because of her or her dad. Because of me. I was so insecure and hateful of every little thing. Sure I hated myself internally but it was outclassed by the sheer hatred I had for her. I loved her deeply in my own fucked up way or at least that's what I tell myself but it all transformed and transmuted into ugly resentful controlling jealous insecure and honestly emotionally destructive feelings for her. Sure I loved her and still did then but it was so toxic, so horrible. She tried to make it up to me for cheating. I genuinely looking back now believed she did in her own way but by then it was too late. I was so in my head, so fucked, so alone. So in my head it bordered delusional that it was never enough. No matter what she did or who she was it wouldn't have been enough. Mind you this is still sophomore year, by far this wasn't the worst yet look how bad all this shit was. Anyway continuing on, obviously we couldn't be together for now as we or maybe I was just too volatile. While separated and in this grey area of are we together or are we done, I tried to reach out to other people I thought were my friends, they weren't. Or maybe that's just how we dudes are supposed to be or something but they didn't really care. It was shock I guess and maybe some words along the lines of \"that's rough man\" or \"good luck bro\". I never felt so fucking isolated in my whole life. It was like even my own suffering didn't matter. It was like my life was some cruel painful fucking joke.  \nNobody cared.\n\nNobody loved me. Nobody was there. I had no one, nothing. I was nobody. I sat alone crying silently sitting straight up unmoving and my eyes hidden by my shades staring at the sky. It was such a profound revelation to me then... I'm nobody. I'm nothing. Like literally what I thought and felt beforehand my whole life but having proven right so brutally by reality? God damn.\n\nIn that moment, in that fucked reality shattering moment. I made a choice, I could sit there and give up completely. I could take the fact I had nobody and that I was nobody to die once I turned 21 like I always believed I'd do since I was kid. I believed as I kid that since I was nothing, I'd give life a chance until I was 21 to then die, it wasn't deep or anything like that. It was my life's imperative. It just what I genuinely believed was normal to me like a fact, same level as the sky can be blue or grass can be green. I could've let all my external circumstances, my past choices, everything I couldn't control allow me give up the final power I always retained, power over what I could control and live in despair.\n\nIt would've been so easy. I mean, it was painful to try, it was painful to hope. I failed over and over. Myself, and to her which was my everything at the time. It all came crashing down on me how worse and worse everything seemed to be. Honestly I have no idea why I never killed myself then... but I'm proud to say in that moment I didn't give in. I didn't give up. I had enough of it all, I was so angry at everything, at her for cheating. At the people for never caring. At life for being so hard. so brutal. At my family for not being normal. At god... yes I even blamed god. I'm not proud of that of course. However soon after, the literal next thought I remember so vividly.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy god? Why was my life so shit? Why did I hate it all? Why did I feel this way? Why is it their faults? Why do I lie to myself? Why ask these questions If I lie to myself? Why am I like this? Why am I such a failure? Why am I the way I am? Why did she cheat? Why do they not care? Why doesn't anyone care? Why does the only person that seems to care is also the person that hurt me? Why should I live? Why should I die? Why am I alive? Why am I so lost?\n\nWhy am I so alone?\n\nI answered it all and I found something priceless to me from all the suffering. Something I treasure to this day and for the rest of my life.\n\nHow I felt went like this as I was thinking deeply:\n\nI had enough, I was sick of it all. It all felt the same. Over and over the bullshit suffering I kept going through and eventually I realized it was all my fault. These circumstances? These events? These people? What could I have possibly done? How could I ever control them? I can't.\n\nWhat can I control? LOVE no matter what? BELIEVE in even if no one else ever will?\n\nME.\n\nI WAS THERE WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS. WHEN NOBODY WAS THERE? I BECAME NOBODY, I LOVED NOBODY. I WAS NOBODY AND THAT WAS EVERTYHING TO ME. NOBODY CARED BUT I DID. NOBODY LOVED ME BUT I CHOSE TO LOVE MYSELF. I MADE THE CHOICE TO INSTEAD OF GIVING UP TO THROW ALL THE BULLSHIT DOWN AND I NEVER FELT MORE FREE, MORE ME.\n\nI found hope not in the circumstances around me but in ME. I found love not from the countless people failed me but in ME. I found it all inside me and honestly, it was always there. I just never thought, felt, or knew about it until I let go of it all. Let go of the lies I tell myself and believed. Let go of the validation I sought from other people. Let go of the horseshit I put myself in. Let go of the romanticization of misery, of woe is me, of finding comfort in despair. It's comfortable at least for me to stay in my lowest points because climbing up and falling was so painful. However that was it, although painful, although devastating to fail over and over I always made progress, I was always better just a bit more even if it was only 1%. The pain was temporary and even if it wasn't? I wanted to conquer it. I guess I got twisted or maybe I just became more me but I loved the pain because the satisfaction, the security, the love, the peace, the fight, the conviction of relying on yourself? Of being independent of it all. Of having...\n\nPride. Healthy genuine honest authentically sincere based pride? No delusional based utterly fantastical lies? No arrogance born from the superiority of others in any way and healthy processing of criticism to be better constantly and be genuinely proud to fail at first only to succeed afterwards because of it? To always have win-win scenarios every time because no matter what, you'll be better from what life does to you? Never worse? To pride yourself in your humble real sincere patient loving understanding of your feelings? To love yourself enough to accept all of and lowkey passionately understand your emotions? To live your life to it's fullest?\n\nI didn't find it all in that moment, of course. It took so much time, so much failure, so loneliness, so much fucking regret. I've lost so many times yet what I did find in that moment was belief.\n\nI believed in myself. Even if no else will, I genuinely believe that belief in oneself is the most fundamentally foundational aspect to a person. Way before self love, way before conviction, way before anything else. Believe in yourself. As long as you do that, your potential is limitless. I genuinely on god, on every fiber of my being, believe that. I believed in myself when no else ever would.\n\nI hope you'll do the same, believe in yourself. Even when no one els- No. Especially when no one else will.✌", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qn3gv1/self_belief/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qn3gv1/self_belief/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

To be honest, I'm not even angry, maybe sad, but not angry. however, I am tormented by another feeling of loneliness, not in their direct actions or deeds, but in the complete lack of contact. No matter how much we talk (I've been friends with one friend for 7-8 years), they still don't understand me at all. neither my actions, nor my character, nor my interests. I'm one of those people who likes, I think, to give myself to something completely. for example, in the knowledge of drawing, I don't want to exalt myself or say that I'm better, I'm just interested in it from the point of view of professionals with their heavy schemes, long training and other goals. not for the sake of social media promotion, and not for the sake of drawing from idleness, like painting some kind of garbage. It's a serious academic and theoretical animation base. but everyone thinks I'm boring and boring. no one shares my interests in my country or among my friends, although this is something basic fandom, for example; Scooby Doo, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Breakfast Club, American Pie, Elena of Avalor, red hot chilli papers, rdr2, Wolfquest, tangled the series. It's not all underground stuff, is it pop? but I have literally never seen anyone who would maintain a dialogue with me or share the same interests. am I as deeply alone in understanding the world as if, although I also consider my opinion to be basic? I am very uncomfortable with any sexist statements towards women, I will always support politics, conversations about public issues, and so on. I don't care about LGBTQ+ communication, or radfem, let people do what they see fit after so many years of oppression. I love animals, walking, swimming, talking for a very long time and a lot.\n\nI mostly talk about other people, or about my hobbies, trying to raise it as it may be of interest to a person. nevertheless, I am not a wimp and have my own moral standards and will resist, I do not agree if I do not like something, and I rarely change my position, I just do not condemn the other. I almost never lie (I really don't remember even once, but I won't be so bold in my statements), I always try to back up my words with facts, I love people, I want to have one beloved wife, a couple of children, whether relatives or not. and at the same time, I am faced with a strong misunderstanding by others and sighs, gasps and absolute disregard for my complaints, as if because I am a \"normal normal person\" my feelings and problems disappear. although to be honest, I have confirmed pstd, and before that I had severe depression. I was prescribed zoloft. I really don't understand, I don't understand why I don't fit in, why I annoy others, why? I have disadvantages, and a lot of them, just like any other person. for example, I am prone to shouting and aggression, although I try to restrain myself (no one has been complaining much lately), stubborn, a little on my own because over time I became ashamed to share my interests. So, my main question is, is there really something wrong with me? Am I weird? Maybe I'm conceited? or something else? of course, this can be poorly understood from one post, lol, but still. \n\n\nP.S. you can ask any questions, try to clarify the situation and not believe everything that I wrote, it's okay", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qm99cv/am_i_weird/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qm99cv/am_i_weird/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I was just surfing around and found this subreddit, decided to take a look, and came up with a post idea. Really, it’s more about letting some things out, thoughts I don’t share with my family or real-life friends because I feel it’s not worth telling them.\n\nI’m just going to rant and explain a bit, but fair warning: it’s going to be long. You’re welcome to read, but it might come across as dumb/stupid, so you’ve been warned.\n\nI feel my loneliness goes two ways: in real life and in virtual life.\n\n**As For Real Life**\n\nIn real life, yes, I am a loser. I do have a job, but not my own place. I make my own money, but I haven’t had a real relationship in about 16 years. My last girlfriend and I broke up because of mistakes on both sides, though it started with me. Since then, I’ve had flings or “relations” that lasted a month or two, but I don’t really count them. For me, a relationship only counts if it lasts at least a year, that’s just my personal view. Sex has become something I don’t see as necessary. It’s awkward for me, though that doesn’t mean I’m asexual, I just don’t find it as important as many others do.\n\nI rarely go out with friends. I’ve become more of a stay-at-home person. I won’t say no to a drink here and there, but parties and drinking for the sake of drinking aren’t my style. Clubbing isn’t my style either. If I go out, it’s usually alone, to the movies, bars, or restaurants. The only company I might have is family, and even that’s rare and usually for special occasions.\n\nAt some point, I lost interest in traveling. Instead of looking forward to it, I find it annoying. Even if I found a place I’d like to visit, I think I’d go alone. I don’t want anyone else along for the ride.\n\nAfter speaking with a therapist and others, I’ve come to the conclusion that I have degrees of two attitudes, or “mental states,” since they don’t qualify as conditions: a degree of OCD and a degree of misanthropy. I’m not a professional in psychology, so I can’t explain the full details.\n\nBut more than my distrust of others, I just think I don’t have any redeeming qualities to be with someone. I feel everything I do is sub-par compared to normal people, and it wouldn’t be fair for them to waste their time on me. I always tell myself: *“I’m not good enough. I’m not worth it.”*\n\nSomething that always comes to mind is a line from *V for Vendetta*:  \n  \n*“I have no tree waiting for me.”*\n\nI think that applies to me too. There’s nothing waiting for me, and whatever I try to build gets undone by the smallest, stupidest details. I’ve adopted a mantra: *“There is nobody and nothing out there for you.”* I realize I have too many flaws and lack the basics to be a good companion. So, I decided to be a loner.\n\nAt times, I wish I had a family, maybe a son or daughter, but I know I’d be an awful dad. I wouldn’t want to put them through the hell of being my children.\n\nI often say: *“There is no woman in her right mind who would stay with me her whole life. It wouldn’t be fair to her.”* There isn’t anyone crazy enough to do that.\n\nI’m also a hopeless romantic. I watch a lot of anime, dive into visual novels, and read light novels with some degree of romance. I can be corny or cheesy as fuck, never really knew the difference between those two, but I don’t do much shipping or anything like that. I just enjoy romance stories.\n\nThe problem is, whenever I project myself onto those stories, I immediately back down and tell myself:\n\n*“Don’t do it, idiot. You know this is never gonna happen to you, because you’re not even as good as a basic fantasy character.”*\n\nThat's what I can say about me in real life.\n\n**As for Virtual Life**\n\nI’ve been trying to make connections on the internet, it’s been a thing for like two decades now, but it always goes to hell. Either it turns out fake, or I ruin it somehow. If you haven’t noticed yet, I’m socially awkward as fuck. I’m awful at making connections in any capacity.\n\nThe most fulfilling thing I ever did in this regard was roleplaying 1x1 with other people. But even that came to an end after basically 16 years. I’ve done stupid shit while roleplaying, not gonna lie, but it was the closest thing I had to a real connection. I doubt my partners even remember me at this point, because honestly, my part was sub-par too.\n\nThis ties into me and “art.” Art and I are basically in a *persona non grata* state. I’ve tried singing, turns out I’m tone-deaf. Tried writing and stand-up comedy, wasn’t funny enough, wasn’t interesting enough. Acting? Can’t project myself well enough. Dancing? No rhythm. Drawing? No talent, no skill. So yeah, art and I don’t see eye to eye.\n\nRoleplaying was the only thing that felt like I was at least \"decent*\"*. But as things changed, with hiatuses here and there, I realized I couldn’t compete, and my ideas weren’t good enough for anyone to pick up another RP with me. So after 16 years, I quit. I left that hobby with a craving I couldn’t fulfill. But then again, life isn’t merciful enough to give you everything you want.\n\nI left this last hobby without finishing a story that had me super engaged (It was a Hazbin Hotel story, don’t judge). Basically, real life came knocking for my partner, and they decided to focus on that. I don’t blame them, real life always comes first, I get that. But I also distrust people, and deep down I know it’s often just a sneaky way of saying they don’t really want to keep going.\n\nAfter facing this kind of shit for 16 years, I finally decided to let go and not come back. Even with that itching, that craving left unfulfilled, maybe even a regret in life, I realized this was something I didn’t belong in. With no one else picking up my ideas, it was time to throw it all away. I was going nowhere with it, and the anxiousness, the void, the constant gnawing feeling was just too much.\n\nSo yeah, not much of a tragic story and maybe even dumber that it should be, but that is it. I am just trying to get along with my loneliness. If you have your comments for this wussy that I am, go ahead, lets just all adhere to the rules.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qlrlea/just_some_dumb_ranting_post/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qlrlea/just_some_dumb_ranting_post/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I work full-time as a supervisor in a coffee shop and live alone. On paper my life probably looks simple enough — but I’ve been struggling with loneliness for a good few years now.\n\nI moved out on my own at 19 and for a while things were great. I was the friend who hosted, the spare bed when someone needed it, the place people could just come and exist for a bit. Then the pandemic hit, and like a lot of people, I slowly got used to my own company a bit too much. Socialising became harder, and that feeling never fully went away.\n\nDuring that time I got a little black cat called Ninja. He honestly kept me sane through everything. I lost him in 2024, and the flat has felt much quieter since.\n\nWork has played a big role in all this too. I spent years in places where I didn’t really fit in, and then finally found my people working at Cineworld. For the first time in ages, I felt like I belonged. We shared interests, humour, music — it just clicked. I made real friends there and stayed until last summer, when I left for a new opportunity, genuinely believing I’d still see everyone.\n\nBut once I left… the messages stopped. I reach out and rarely hear back. People are “busy,” yet I see them out together, going on trips, living life — just without me. That’s been one of the hardest parts to process.\n\nI’ve always had this quiet fear of being forgettable. Like once I’m not right in front of people, I fade into the background. Over the last year, that feeling’s become a lot louder.\n\nI’ve tried doing things solo — holidays, cinema trips, exploring on my own — and while I can do it, I’m tired of always having to. I don’t think wanting connection makes someone weak. I think it makes us human.\n\nDating hasn’t been much better. I was single for a long time, then recently met someone I really connected with. For the first time in years I felt wanted. I think I came on too strong trying to be supportive, and it overwhelmed her. Losing that connection hurt more than I expected.\n\nI’m not posting this for pity. I just want to feel seen, and to talk to people who might be feeling something similar. If you’re lonely too, or just want a genuine conversation — my DMs are open. We can talk about anything at all.\n\nIf you read all of this, thank you.

{"id": "1qj6ewp", "subreddit": "loneliness", "created_utc": 1769021158, "author": "Reina-Wombatica", "title": "Ostracized From The Culture Of An Interest/Hobby/Personal Identifier", "selftext": "TL;DR: A long vent about how I don't connect with people who share my interests and personal demographics that ends in personal examination and questioning. I'm not so much asking for answers as I'm just trying to vent about my brand of loneliness.\n\nFor context, I'm 41, Live in the Southern US, and identify as a Transgender Female, although I'm non-passable.\n\nSeeking to cure my loneliness, I started looking towards my list of interests to find like-minded people to connect with. Here's what I've found.\n\nThe first community I've tried to connect with is the Trans community. I spent over a month migrating from one subreddit to another, and through multiple Discord servers. I found that alot of these places were mostly comprised of much younger people. I generally don't talk to people under 25, so by process of elimination, my pool of choices significantly decreased. The places I *did* feel comfortable in out of those were few and that comfort didn't last long as these places were heavily politicized and those who even dare question the statements of core members/ideologies were outright ignored and/or banned.\n\nThen I moved to the retrogaming community. I found this community to be comprised of people who prize physical ownership of carts/discs and those who have ROMs are generally ignored. Also, I noticed that people in this area are very elitist and love gate keeping based on one subjective value or another. Over time, my list of available places to be with others with this shared interest dwindled to nothing.\n\nI thought to myself: \"Okay, maybe people closer to my age bracket would be more amenable as we have the area of shared experience\". This turned out to be a bust as well. Most people my age arent very accepting of transpeople. Of those that were accepting, I didn't find much common ground with to maintain a friendship. Over time, I withdrew from those spaces and no one seemed to care.\n\nEven as a child, I didn't find many real connections with people. There was a long period during which I participated in the party scene. Sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll as it were. The connections made there never lasted for obvious reasons and soon after I turned 18, I moved out of state.\n\nI wonder if I'm the problem.  For more context, I have several mental illnesses mostly stemming from events in my childhood, for which I've been in therapy for years. I've always existed in this mode of feeling like I was different. Maybe some of that is a choice. I've spent a long time trying to work on myself, keeping what's genuine and changing what doesn't work. I've made mistakes in the past that cost me some connections. My divorce is a direct result of my infidelity. I've lost friends over disagreements on issues I probably could have been more flexible with. I've passed on possible connections with people over perceived red flags that maybe weren't red flags to begin with. I do accept that at least some of the time, my loneliness is my fault; but lately I've been asking myself if I'm the problem all of the time.\n\nI've always tried to be logical in my examination of self. The scientific method is comprised of 3 basic parts. Variable, constant, and result. When I apply that to my loneliness, I find the variable is others, the constant is me, and the result is being alone. The logical conclusion is that I'm the problem.\n\nThe internal questions I have is what do I have to change to become more socially desirable, and how do I change in a genuine way so as to not become an imposter of sorts. My line in the sand has always been honesty in who I am, warts and all. Maybe I've become one of those old dogs who is too set in their ways. Maybe my mental illnesses are still informing my behavior too much. Maybe I'm too picky. I don't know. Maybe this is too rooted in self doubt.\n\nThanks for giving me a space to vent about it.\n\nBest Wishes to All.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qj6ewp/ostracized_from_the_culture_of_an/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1qj6ewp/ostracized_from_the_culture_of_an/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Grew up in small town Idaho from 6 years old. Told my whole life I'm exceptionally intelligent, articulate, creative, funny, resourceful, talented, the usual motivational spiel from counselors and teachers, despite having terrible grades - not for lack of knowledge or ability as my test scores were always top 3% but because I couldn't focus to do homework and told my Sr English teacher to fuck herself in class after she openly made a snide comment about my dad. Never went to that class again, wasn't allowed a diploma and had to go through the community outreach from the university to get my GED and HSE. Went to college for diesel technology and on site power generation. Top of my class. \nNow 15 years professional experience (and as a hobby and passion since I was 7) repairing everything from automotive and auto body before I went to college to then engine remanufacturing, generator repair, oil field work on fracking equipment etc, construction equipment, mining equipment. Was good at it. Gave me purpose and the satisfaction of a job well done with my own hands and expertise. But as a technician, there's seldom room to move up and after years of sacrificing the body to get the job done right and as fast as possible, the injuries have slowed me down. And years of being just a meaningless cog in the corporate machine - expendable, unappreciated, underpaid, beyond overworked, ive burned out. I no longer can find the motivation to pick up my tools. Not even for my rock crawler project. \n\nIve not had good luck with relationships. Bad one 13, very ugly but won't elaborate. Another at 15, she killed herself. One I met at 16 in high school, ugly for 4 years. Finally broke that one off in college. Met M. In high school and we hung out but never dated, although found out later after we reconnected in 2013 that she had a crush on me in high school And tbh I did on her too. She had to move away her Jr year (she's 2 years younger than i) but in '13 we reconnected midsummer, and I paid for a bus ticket for her to come visit for a month and it was magic. We were married in May 2014. I'm in college. I help her learn to drive, then drive a stick shift, help her get her first job. I work weekends and summers doing construction and fabrication for a friend. Graduate, get job at equipment company. Early 16 it falls apart. M. Is cheating on me with co workers, has an emotional affair long distance with her ex too. We divorced. She takes the dog. The baby we went and picked up from a pet store in June '15. That little pup was like our child. Divorce 2 weeks before 2 year anniversary. I get let go from work during this time, poor performance, distracted, inattentive. \nMove back to home town, parents moved to big city so I get job with 110 mile commute each way. $16/hr, no benefits, 40 hours a week. If you work overtime, they scalp your timecard down to 40. If your 1 minute late, docked 1hr pay. Barely make enough to pay rent to parents for their house there and cover gas to keep going to work. Exclusively feed myself using credit card and make minimum payments. Spend 2016 in a bottle.  That Christmas, alone and profoundly lonely, I drink my last bottle, put the gun to my head and pull the trigger. Cheap fucking ammo sabotages me again. Put the gun down, angry, give up and pass out. \nKeep going to work. Bills don't pay themselves. Early '17 give up drinking. Go to gym every day. 4 hours minimum. 8 on weekends, 4 hours morning, 4 evening. Lose 86 lbs. Build tons of muscle. Thin out. A lot. Meet new girl through the guy who was the vocalist for my band right out of high school. M. As well, so we'll call her M2. We start slow, very flirty and voluminous conversations. Talk about music. Off road vehicles. Camping. Fishing. Philosophy. About a month in she drives across Wyoming and surprises me at my house on a Friday night just as I hobble my way in from a long week at work. Instant passion and intense attraction. She plays video games with me. We make homemade cheesecake and shit. The sappy saccharin honeymoon phase. We date for 4 months. But im broken internally and not ready to commit to a serious relationship, not because I'm playing the field or anything, just afraid to open up too much. Hasn't panned out in my favor so far. We finally split, sometime around october ish? M2. The one that got away. She was good. Good for me. But I wasn't good for her. \n2018 I start working the oil fields. Move myself to the same big city mom and dad moved to so I could be around to help take care of them. They're elderly,  dad shattered 4 vertebrae 6 years earlier trying to lift the back half of mom's concert grand piano, insurance being the cunts they are force him onto opioid painkillers against doctors orders saying \"mandatory painkiller therapy for 8 weeks before any surgery is considered\" meanwhile the surgery he needs is only viable for 2 weeks from date of injury. He lives with permanent disability, back pain, pinched nerves, COPD from 40 years of smoking. Mom is a frail woman, all of 4'10. But I'm 6'3\", 240 lbs. Professional mechanic. Workhorse. Can do carpentry, plumbing, mechanics, electrical, just about any skill you can have with your hands I\n Can do it. And I was a nightmare to raise. Owed it to them to help take care of them. \nOil fields are brutal. Grueling. 17 days on, 4 off. Fly cross country to work 14 hour days 17 days straight. Bad pay, but good hours. Put money away. Take care of mom and dad. Make friends in the fields from all over the country and the world. Nov. 1, '18 after round 4 of layoffs, I and a few of my friends still survive, but they cut to 40 hrs a week. Mind you, we're still there 17 days straight. Only given 40 hrs a week though. Situation untenable, look for exit strategy. Friends do the same. Dec 1, round 5 of layoffs, we manage to stay again, but by end of month we've all found jobs back home, tell service department head to jam his 40 hours a week in his ass until he can taste the ink on the memo. \nI find work for an equipment rental company. At that same time as im job hunting, M. And I reconcile. The weekend before my final hitch I fly down to visit her in her home city that she moved back to after we split. Decide to give it a go again. I see my baby boy for the first time in 2 years too. He was 1 when I disappeared from his life, thought he wouldn't recognize me. At her apartment door, I knock. She opens. Bubba (not his real name, just the nickname we gave him) comes out and smells me carefully, guarding her, then through the funk of grease and oil and sweat that permeates my clothes permanently, he recognizes the smell. So excited he pees, wagging so hard his whole body is curling left then right then back again. He recognizes me after all. I cry a little. Happy. Happier than I'd been in over 2 years. We go to eat, talk. Plan. Her lease is up Feb 10. Her shitbox $800 Buick isn't gonna drive her to big city where're I live, and we get snow so it's not really suitable for winter even if it could manage the trip. So she sells her car the day I drive my truck down to pick her and her stuff up. Move her in with me, surprise her with a new jeep, 38 miles on it (plus whatever I added getting it home from dealership) that I hid in garage, having joked about having to find her a pinto or some bullshit when she gets here. She's ecstatic. Things go good. Very good. We remarry. I had rescued a min pin from an abusive home in the end of 17, and she rescued 2 chihuahuas (sisters, littermates) so we live in a basement apartment with 4 small dogs. \nI work 60 hours a week. She gets a job at a manufacturing plant, 40 hours, nights. We dont see each other tons for the first year and a half but when we do, its all love and fun.\nCovid hits. Can't see mom and dad, I work as a field tech, im constantly exposed and they're serious at-risk people, dad has stage 3 COPD, obese, disabled, elderly. Mom, 3 years younger, also elderly, lifelong smoker. So our interaction through 2020 and 2021 was phone calls and occasionally we would visit in person but we never enter the home. They sit on back porch and we sit at the far end of the back yard just through the gate to the back driveway and garages. But we get through. They dont get covid, (miraculously neither did we will early 2023 after we had bought our own home) eventually things go back to \"normal\" whatever the fuck that means nowdays.\nI start battling some physical health issues in 23. Tough but not unmanageable. They come 2 1/2 years after starting psych meds for bi-polar, BPD, ADHD, autism, severe depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, and at the same time I quit smoking. \nAt work, unappreciated even though I'm best tech in branch, and having gone 3 years since companies ended pay raises in beginning of covid and just never brought them back, repeatedly ignored when applied for new positions in company - nothing more than the auto reply \"your application has been received\", stuck with no mobility and no improvement in means or benefits or compensation despite ever rising cost of living, I quit. Mortgage is 2500 a month. After food, utilities, meds, dogs etc M. And I net a little more than $100 a month. But we make ends meet. \nGet job at union shop. Good pay. 6 month wait to be fully unionized. Pension after 30 yrs. Things looking up. Property tax went up raising mortgage, utilities cost more, food costs more. But thanks to new job we can still make ends meet. \nJune of '24. Im home on a Tuesday, health issues flared up so I used my 1 accrued day of pto for a day off to rest. Just shy of 6 months into the new job. M. At work, she now works days, 7am-7pm 3 on 4 off 4 on 3 off, first half of week. \nLaying on couch with YouTube playing quietly in background. Get call from unknown number. \nPick up. \"Hello? \"\n\"Is this [OP]?\"\nYes.\n\"I've been trying to get ahold of you for a while now. This is officer [blur, could never retain names]. I... I don't know how to tell you this... your father, he... he took his own life...\"\nRinging in my ears. I can't hear anything else he says. \n\"I'll be right there\".\nMom's visiting friends in Washington. Little sister lives in Idaho. Older sisters in Illinois and Texas. I'm the only one around. Dad worked for the state. Had left that day around 11. under a lot of stress. Said to his boss \"I need to take a break\"... didn't answer calls so by 2 they called local PD requesting wellness check. I guess he'd gotten home, sat on the front porch, and shot himself. \n\nI call my wife. Incoherent, now openly sobbing sitting against my mailbox. Tell her. She leaves work. Picks me up. We arrive at mom and dad's house. Cops stop me as I get out. They talk to me but they may as well have been speaking Chinese. I just see them load my dad into a stretcher, the sheet had fallen off as they moved him. I got to see firsthand what was left of dad. They caught my stare, quickly covered him again. Loaded him. Drove away. As I sit there on the curb. Sick. My chest heavy like a Cat 988k wheel loader has parked on it for the night. Every breath feels like breathing lead. Stomach sinking. M. gathering information, trying to handle things while I spiral. \nEventually they leave. And it's M. And me. Trying to figure out what to do. We go to the porch. Bits of dad's brain and blood on the couch where he sat. Across the window. On the ceiling of the awning over the porch where the bullet went into the attic. \nWe go inside. Get cleaner and paper towel and a bag. We clean up the leftovers. Sit. Cry. \nI call mom. They'd been together for almost 50 years. I tell her to pull over because she's driving, on her way home. She does. I tell her. \nScreams. Wailing. More screams. Crying. I tell her I gotta call my sisters. Hang up as she's screaming into the forest. \nCall C. Oldest sister. Give the news. Something breaks. \nM. is repeatedly trying to call A. The 2nd oldest. \nI call K. My younger sister. She replies with disbelief. Cries. Questions I don't have answers to. \nM. Finally gets through to A. Who had been essentially estranged from rest of family, had to do her own thing in life. She gives the news. \nWhole family reeling. Broken. Confused. \nNext week is a blur. Mom made it home, we sat down, cried, planned. I dont recall anything until the funeral.\n Had called my job, told boss what happened the following morning. 2 days from being unionized. I don't apply for bereavement yet, haven't reached my 6 month mark. Only had 1 day pto, already used. They let me go. \nJust one more log on the pile. week after dad died, M. Comes home from work early. Her first day back after bereavement, a Wednesday. Her boss pulled her off production line and stuck her alone at the shipping desk, has her printing shipping labels and shit. She snaps, asks him why he's retaliating for her taking bereavement. He gives some corporate answer about worker safety and she had a compromised emotional state - not entirely wrong as m. Didn't have a dad in her life, her mom was a junkie, so she was raised by her grandma till she died of cancer while she was in high school, then went to live with her \"step dad?\" (The man that dated her grandma for some time before her passing) that had tried to raise her as his own while her mom was busy on multi month benders. \nBut my dad took her in as his own too. Saw how much I loved her, tried to welcome her into the family as best as he could. They got along well. And his death hurt her. And she could see how it devastated me and that hurt her even more. \nBut she felt demeaned and betrayed, so she quit. \nWe sit there in our living room. Talk. Cry. Decide on Chinese takeout for dinner. Make due.\nFuneral comes, we bury dad. Finally get home after 7 hours of driving.\n I take his funeral pamphlet, the one picture I have of him and me (my favorite picture, him, a younger father, around 40 now. Still black hair and beard, thinner, smiling a smile that wraps around his head. Holding me as an infant in moab utah), his watch. Set it all on a little cabinet we set up in the living room, now cleared slightly for a memorial we could visit, as dad's buried a 3.5 hour drive away. \nThis is the new normal I guess. \nM. And I keep going, help get final affairs settled. Take care of mom. \nMom... world shattered. Lost. She was a lifelong addict and alcoholic. Dad was emotionally abusive, narcissistic, deeply flawed, and often cruel. He did his best, but didn't know how to be emotionally available or how to communicate in any manner other than logically and clinically. Law, psychology, logic. Cold. Calm. Calculating. \nThat had hurt C, the first child. Led to depression and suicidal ideology when she was a child. They put her in a mental hospital and it helped her, she got medication and therapy and stuff. \nIt had fucked up A. To the point she cut the family off mostly. Trying to protect herself and heal from the manipulation and abuse and neglect as a child. \nBy the time I came around, dad had gotten physically abusive as well. Couldn't tell you how many times he literally hog tied me and beat me with various blunt instruments until they broke, then took out the belt and continued until he was tired, then left me there, bruised and bloody, at 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 years old, still hog tied behind my back, until mom wandered home from the bar and untied me. From 6 years old I got cold logic from him, intertwined with insane rage from a man who never learned how to control his emotions or how to process feelings.\nIntermittently throughout the year I'd get an \"I love you son\" or something. Still get birthday parties (kind of) and Christmas stuff, but by 7 years old it started feeling hollow and performative. Despite all this, I admired him. Smart. Well spoken. Well read. Witty. And that cold logical planning of his made him exceptional at formulating plans. Malicious compliance. Manipulating things by following the letter of the law while breaking the spirit of it. How to get revenge on people that wronged me or the family or friends, in a way that would cause broader problems than just giving them a pavement facial or something. And he was a mechanic early in life. I helped him work on cars from age 6. I still loved him. He was my dad. I didn't know I was being abused or manipulated. I was a kid.\nK. Also got depression and stuff from his abuse. She being the baby was given the most attention and support though so she did better, and got resources in late teens to get therapy and to learn how to actually cope in a healthy way.\n\nBut mom, she had almost 50 years of that. Between pickling her brain until she was convinced the government can shoot microwave sound guns into her fucking brain to torture her for... fun? I assume?, and the drug abuse, and the emotional abuse and manipulation, well... she couldn't cope with life without him. \nBut ive been here since trying to help her hold it together.\nM. Finds a new job late summer. Worse pay. Worse hours. But it's money. I find a new job October. We manage. Thanks to a few grand in life insurance from the policy dad designated to me - dictating pay off his new jeep and give to K. , pay off charger and I get to keep (C. And A. Had  years prior been given inheritance from both grandpa's and grandma's estates that allowed them to get a leg up in life, a. Bought a house,  c. Put in savings or used for college and stuff, so giving to K. And I was dad trying to balance the scales for the younger of the 2 generations of his kids, as the death benefits pension and stuff would take care of mom). I sold the charger to pay bills. I miss that car. Such is life. \nOctober '24 the first of only 2 friends I made in this city commits suicide. One of my closest friends. And I break a little more. Another log on the pile. \nJanuary '25 I get severe vertigo for 2 weeks. Need 7 rounds of PT. Need help getting out of bed. Need help walking to bathroom. Still new hire at new company, they let me go. Don't blame them, I can't perform my job due to health issues. \nWe're still able to make due. Barely. \nEnd of January m. Gets laid off, her company does huge reduction in force, 2/3 of crews cut. Now we worry. I sell my drum kit. My consoles. Duplicate tools and rock crawler parts and anything that'll make money. We scrape by. \nMid January M. And I had a fight. Then later that night a very long talk. All about how we have no physical intimacy. My antidepressant (the only one of 37 different ones I tried that worked) had killed my libido. The spirit was willing but the body unable. We still hugged and kissed, still did playful shit, but hadn't had sex in a year and a half at this point. The meds made me gain almost 200 lbs, despite dieting and exercise, and physically demanding job (up until dad's death at which point I weighed 420 lbs) so I'm sure that added to the problem physiologically. \nShe insisted and reluctantly, I agreed, to a physically open marriage because after all she had needs I couldn't meet at the moment. I didn't want to lose her over that, over pride or ego or whatever, despite my lifelong insecurities.  Conditions were I never met or saw them, and it stayed strictly physical. But we stayed partners. \nEnd if February she meets a Trans woman named J. Mentions her as a friend. They go rock climbing and to brunch and shit. \nApril '25 M. Comes in to the bedroom one evening.\n\"I don't wanna do this anymore. Monogamy isn't for me.\" Drops me like last week's garbage. No talking, no explanation, no justification or reasoning. Just, done. \nI had picked up smoking again. 4 years 3 months free. I packed my clothes, took the 2 boys, moved into mom's spare room. Dad's old room...\nMy world shattering more every day. \nEventually get most of my things, tools from the garage and shit mostly. Had to get a new bed and desk. She kept all the furnishings, decorations, etc. I didn't care anymore, and even if I did, had nowhere to put any of it. \nI file for divorce. It grinds along through the summer. I'm unemployed. Broken. So tired but no amount of sleep fixes it. Lost. Betrayed. Hurt beyond words. Mental anguish to the point of physical illness. Can't eat but one meal every 3 or 4 days. Drop the psych meds, can't afford it and they're not helping anyways. Maybe at least I can lose some weight. Recurring vomiting every morning. Deep deep deep loathing of myself. My failures abound. My 2 pups are the only company I have. I live with mom but we barely talk. I just try to help where I can. \nOne of my buddies from the oil fields ended up moving here some years back so I have 2 friends here in city. We hang out exactly once in '25. Same with my other buddy that lives here. \nI've had 2 social interactions all year with friends. \nIn June I met a gal named Ray. Couple dates, things aren't bad - though slightly awkward. Go to pick her up from her apartment one Sunday in early July for a coffee date. Ambulance, some cops, neighbors giving statements. She'd committed suicide. \nI sit on my tailgate and smoke a half a pack of cigarettes straight. Left. Process. Cope. Move on I guess. \nLater that month, I'm in grocery store. Debating spicy chicken or classic beef cup noodles. Up walks Kaylee. 10 years my junior, goth (my type historically although not with good results), gorgeous, smart, funny. An engineer. She asks me for my number. We go on a couple dates. I'm still lost, broken. Existing out of spite. So I don't open up much. Don't tell her the history. Just \"bad divorce, suicide in the family, been a hard year for me. But I'd rather not dwell\" so she doesn't press. We go out more, coffee and walk in the park. A bar with some local band. Taking things slow. \nAugust comes and goes. I spend my birthday totally alone. 5 fb posts on my wall from my old manager, couple people I knew back in my hometown, and my dad's cousin and his wife. A text from each of my sisters, my mom, my closest and oldest friend who lives back in my home town, and An automated one from my dentists office. \nEat ramen on the porch in silence. Get drunk. Smoke weed. Black out. \nSeptember - uneventful. Chat with Kaylee, couple dates. \nBeginning of October, Kaylee commits suicide. OD on psych meds. There's no funeral, her parents both long dead and an only child, her friend N. (Her only friend in this city) Arranges the cremation with the benefits from kaylee's employer. She didn't have friends from her home town, so N. Was really all she had.\nI feel pangs inside, understanding that profound loneliness and the feelings of anguish and hopelessness. I didn't open up, so she didn't really either. I could've helped. But I didn't notice. \nAnother friend falls through the cracks. Another I failed to help. That makes 7 in my life. 4 in a year and a half. \nIt hurts different. Another log on the pile. The pile that is now burning out of control. Filled with gas and decades of logs.\nI reflect. \n26 years I've suffered with this. Bipolar, BPD, ADHD, autism,  severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks. Attempted suicide at 13. Don't know how many aspirin it takes to kill me but 27 isn't it. Tried again at 24. Cheap ammo. \nGot medicated. Did therapy. Talked to friends. Talked to M. Online groups. \nStill, lifelong, profound hollowness. Empty. Worthless. Self loathing deeper than the Marianas trench. Feelings of perpetual inadequacy, zero self respect, hatred of my own self image. Somethings irreparably broken in me. Always has. I've just been good enough with the duct tape and the scraps of affection I'd been given my whole life to manage.\n\nBut since April the only consistent thought is suicide. How to i kill myself without leaving a big mess? Trying to tie up loose ends. Make plans. \n\nSold house pursuant to divorce agreements in end of sept.\nDivorce finalized Oct 2. Within a month M. Is remarried, back to living that monogamous life she said she didn't want. \nShe didn't want it, not with me at least. \nGet job in October, good job. Bury myself in that. Scraping by my meager existence. Week before Christmas, reduction in force. Guess who's first in the block. \nNew guy. \n\nBroke. Broken. Spend Christmas alone. Mom went to a friend's. Glad she's able to get out and have fun. \nI sit on the porch. Smoke weed. Drink more crown. Longingly eyeball my .40 s&w.\nNo. Gotta get affairs in order. Gotta make sure the boys are taken care of. Gotta find a way to not cost anyone any more money when I go.  Gotta do it somewhere where mom won't see or have to clean up. \n\nNew years comes. Smoke until I black out around 10. \n\nCouple weeks go by. I talk to my marine buddy P.  from the oil fields. Break down. Tell him all this. Tell him there's almost certainly gonna come a day he gets a message that I couldn't take it anymore and left on my own terms. \nTell my best friend Z. the one from back home. \nHad previously told my buddy L. And our gaming group on discord. \n\nNot to seek pity or anything. Just to inform them the reality that I've never been ok and it's getting worse. Don't want to blindside them with it. Trying to prepare them. Get them to build up walls so it's easier to weather. \n\nFeel slightly relieved in a way. Not better, but like a little of the weight fell off. Like maybe it won't hurt them as bad now. \n\nI know they love me. I love them too. But it doesn't make the voice stop. It doesn't make me hate me any less. Doesn't make me not want to die any more. Just means my death is gonna be messier than I hoped. \n\nIt's now Jan 20 '26. Haven't slept in 3 days. Nearly every thought is how to die. \nI doomscroll. I sit here typing this. \nProfoundly empty. Hollow. So much so that the vile voice in my head echoes constantly. \nNever hated myself more. Never felt so unworthy of life, nor so undeserving of love. Never felt like such a failure as I do now. I've worked 108 hour weeks in bitter cold and blistering heat in grueling conditions. Never felt so tired in all my life. \nMusic has no sound. Food has no flavor. \nThe world is more 2 dimensional than copy paper. There's no color. There's no smell. \nI live in a cage. A prison.\nA prison I've spent 26 years in. \nPartly of my own making. I filled in the windows with concrete. I welded the door shut. \n\nI am merely a husk. A warm corpse still walking. Completely empty. Devoid of anything human. \n\nWhat do you do with that? \n\nAnd how do I leave in the least disruptive, most cost effective manner? How do I not fuck it up for the maybe 15 people I leave behind that care that I existed?

I've had an unconventional start to my life. I never went to regular school; I was homeschooled and then started college/uni as a young teen. Because everyone was older than me and an adult, I didn't make any friends. I was never in any kind of social group, so between being homeschooled and starting college at a different stage of life, I lacked a lot of social skills, and I still do. I relied on online communities as a way to talk to people, and those friendships/connections faded quickly. \n\nI went to grad school and I think I got a little better at socializing, but I graduated a while ago, and I don't really have anyone who has stayed in contact with me since I graduated. Even in grad school, I wasn't really a part of any social groups. I tried to go to bar nights, events with my grad program, and tailgate parties, but nothing really stuck.\n\nI see myself as a pretty dry person. I have a few special interests in some topics, but I think those tend to bore other people pretty quickly. I wouldn't call myself a good conversationalist or fun to talk to, and I don't really know how to continue convos once they start dying down. \n\nOne of my only friends is a guy (22M) I've known online for a few years now from a fandom community. He used to make fun of me considerably for my poor social skills and health issues and call me \"the quiet kid.\" He even used to tell me that sometimes he wished he could beat me up really bad. I used to feel like I was the problem and that something about me made him act like this. \n\nIt's gotten a little better since I confronted him and told him that I was setting several boundaries such as not saying those things to me. Even so, having someone spamming me with reels more than having actual conversations just makes me feel kinda empty. I had another good friend that community but we cut off with each other because I'm a progressive and he's on the far side of the conservative spectrum, and he seemed to be intentionally trying to provoke me by sending me racist and lgbtqphobic posts to \"discuss\" them (especially knowing I'm not straight). \n\nI've never felt more like I'm running out of time than now. I'm 24, and it was easy enough to tell myself that things would change years ago, but I'm about to hit 25 and it feels like the prospect of making good healthy friendships is over for me. I genuinely don't believe I have anything valuable, interesting, or individual enough to offer someone that they couldn't get from someone else.

I don't mean to say that to be alarming, but I will say that my day-to-day life isn't anything that I really want anymore. \n\nI've been on medications for my mental health for quite some time. In fact, I had years of remission from depression. Currently, I don't feel the weight of depression; I've felt it, and it's not this -- whatever this is. \n\nI've been in several long-term relationships. I've experienced being cheated on, no longer loved, and long fade-outs. My most recent relationship was challenging: she was a bit younger, and she didn't like that I have been on medication, didn't like my age, didn't like a number of things. She is very close with her family, and I know they played a role in shaping those opinions that surfaced after some time. \n\nI'm 40. I don't like being 40, but it didn't feel like an issue until I started internalizing the \"you're getting old\" comments from my last girlfriend. I don't feel \"old\" physically. Right now, I feel healthier than I did in my 20s. No aches, no pains, no injuries. I have asthma, but I was diagnosed with that when I was a child. It's moderate to severe, but it's nothing new. \n\nI felt like a fool around my ex-girlfriend's family. My bad dancing was a problem. Sounds silly -- I know. I also realized that I have no idea how to act around children, and I became very self-conscious about it. I tried to \"just talk\" to them, but they weren't all that interested. The experience did a good job at dredging up how I felt as a child when I had no friends because I didn't know how to talk to them then either. \n\nIt's ridiculous, but at times I still feel like there's something about the relationship that is unresolved. I still love this person who could be very cruel. I feel like it's another failure in my life that it didn't work out. \n\nI used to get a lot of energy from being around people. I'm kind of a hermit now. I don't feel that I have things to talk about at the moment because my mind is generally in a lousy place. I feel that I annoy people. I can be pretty quiet in general, but I think I've become more quiet, more withdrawn since my last relationship. \n\nI don't really have any friends that I see regularly. They live in different states. I talk to one friend regularly on the phone. It's been about a week since the last time we talked. I don't want to be a burden. Generally, I try to prepare what I'm going to say to friends at this point because my default mode isn't happy or positive, and I haven't been doing much other than staying in my place. \n\nMy family is small: parents, uncle, and that's about it. My mother has been sick for the past couple years. They don't live anywhere near me. I'm able to take a flight to see them every now and then. \n\nI can't have any pets. I like the idea of having a dog, but I'm allergic to most animals. My odd work schedule would preclude any situation with having a pet anyway. It would be nice, but it can't be. \n\nI'm disappointed in my career. I have been doing the same thing for a decade, and I have been actively trying to get out of it for several years. No dice. (I'm an \"overqualified\" registered nurse who wants to be trained in a different specialty. Not easy to come by those opportunities.)\n\nI just want to feel some sense of normalcy, some happiness, something besides this. I'm lonely, and I'm alone. At one point, I thought I could have a family. I don't see that happening anymore. \"Too old,\" I suppose. I wish there were a reset button for this whole thing. I'm tired.

Im a 40 year old male living in Carlsbad, NM. I live alone with my dog, and have no hope of finding a romantic partner. My family keeps hounding me about my loneliness, that I'm not doing enough, that I'm spending too much time shut in my apartment. To be clear, I'm very unhappy, I have nobody here, nobody invites me anywhere and I would mostly like to have a romantic partner not just friends.\n\nHere are my reasons to stay in my home:\n\n1. I have all my entertainment in my apartment: video games, streaming, anime, books, manga, my dog, Lego, Gunpla, etc.\n2. I thought I would get to meet and chat other dog owners in my walks, but they see me and my dog approaching and they just avoid us like we're the plague.\n3. I highly doubt people, especially women, want to be approached by total stranger. Not only do I not know what I could talk about when I approach, but I would be suspicious if someone would just approach me out of the blue.\n4. I hear there is a place where they play D&D on Sundays, but I've never been into D&D (never grew up with it), and given my current hobbies I don't think I should sink more money into another one, especially if it will make me going into a deeper nerdy blackhole than the one Im in now. Moreover, I picture myself actually going to that place and everyone would look at me suspiciously as I enter alone, with no friends. I don't know what to do when I show up to places like that alone.\n5. There is a shooting range here, but I don't think I should be around guns in my current state for obvious reasons.\n6. I'm fat, and I feel I attract a lot of attention wherever I go. A restaurant would make me look like a lonely pig, hence why I order out when I want to eat out. I also get told to go to the gym. Yes the gym, where people go to flaunt their slim bodies. Also, nothing says \"talk to me\" more than a pair of headphones (sarcasm). People, especially women, don't want to be approached at the gym!\n7. What else is there around here? Hiking? Why would I go somewhere else to feel more alone when I can at least entertain myself at home and not be seen as a lonely creep out there?\n8. Bars? Pubs? I don't drink!! and Im not going to lie by ordering something and make it look like a drink. what would be the damn point then!?\n\nSeriously, I don't know what else to do and how to explain my situation to my family. They keep saying \"you have to get out more\". But where?? What am I supposed to do when I'm out???\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I in the wrong here? I seriously dont know what else to do.\n\nEDIT: I am in DBT therapy and before that I was in CBT for depression and anxiety for 15 years. I currently take medication as well.

But after some time, all of this starts to bore you. You stop talking to them, joking, or simply interacting with them whatsoever.  \nIn the end, they just stay in your friends list, waiting for you to delete them.  \nThen you find another person with similar interests and the cycle repeats.  \nAt some point, I got so tired of this that I stopped having conversations with people at all.  \nNow I am somewhere far away, watching how everyone else enjoys life by communicating with each other.\n\nThis has affected my mental health very strongly. I think the reason for all of this was my lifestyle.  \nSince the age of 6, I have been flying to many different countries.  \nIn a regular school with a normal social environment, I was only able to study for 3 years until the age of 10. Then coronavirus started. I switched to homeschooling. Then I flew from Ukraine to Turkey. Contact with peers completely disappeared. Because of some problems, we got stuck in Turkey for 2 years. After 2 years, my family was planning to return back to Ukraine, but the war happened. I no longer remember why, but we flew to the Dominican Republic. Another year passed. My sister flew to study in Britain, and my mother and I flew to Canada.  \nI am 13. I went to 8th grade in Canada. I studied English almost my entire life. Despite this, I did not communicate with anyone at all, I did not know how to start a dialogue.  \nI am 14. I went to 9th grade. In the first semester, I barely communicated, in the second semester I began to adapt better to communicating with people.  \nI am 15. I went to 10th grade. The end of the first semester is approaching. I made \"school\" friends. We exist for each other only when we are at school. This does not really upset me. As always, they get boring to me very quickly, and contact with them only at school is more than enough.  \nBut all of this is not it.  \nMy mother asks me why I am still not interested in having a girlfriend. I ask myself why I am not interested in people. Am I really just destined to be like this my whole life? All this anger began to form a shitty character. I began to envy the people around me. If someone is better than me at something, smarter, more charismatic, more extravagant, I definitely must surpass them. When I remained the only best of the bests, nothing except emptiness did this give me.\n\nIf I remain the only person on Earth, I will be the winner.

Dealing with life & the bull it brings my way, I’m struggling with being alone. No friends I don’t have any & most everyone I know is just an acquaintance, I want a relationship you know, I’m tired of being alone. It sucks doing things positive in my life just to fold everything I want so deeply into a ball & swallow it. I’m 28, honestly never been in a relationship. \n\nYou know I’m of the mind that woman don’t want a man in my position, broke, mental problems, no car, not good looking & I understand because I am able to see myself objectively. However it sucks that the times a woman has shown interest I just don’t commit to furthering it, it’s like I’m unable to commit or maybe years of self sabotage & hatred mixed with zero self esteem & worth.\n\nIt’s likely a mixture of things, once I had a co worker who came home with me after I somehow worked up the courage to ask if she wanted to come over after work & eat dinner with me. We did, I enjoyed my time with her but looking back it was just us there, and she knew I lived alone. She’d always make sexual jokes at work only with me & we both had similar interests. I knew that night with her that I had a chance with her & I didn’t capitalize… I’m a virgin as well & never even held hands with a woman so any man above a certain age will feel my pain. I don’t know what to do about it & honestly don’t think I ever will.\n\nWhich leads to why? Why am I trying so hard? Why am I not trying to off myself like 7 months ago? Nothings changed for me, my ultimate goal is family & most of my childhood people have passed away. My longest life goal has been to be in a relationship, yet I’m incapable of making it happen even when it’s in the palm of my hand. I’m mostly afraid, my only examples of love have been online fake standards, my parents incredibly toxic & abusive relationship, and the rare gems that don’t seem likely at all for a guy like me.\n\nI feel an incredible longing anytime I see couples in public or at my job or at my program. I want love so bad but literally I’m the one thing holding myself back & it feels impossible to stop myself from doing so. A woman hugged me today, all we did was share a joint & she was much older than me, but after I realized that was the second time a woman that wasn’t related to me hugged me in my entire life.\n\nJust saying that is incredibly sad & the amount of touch starvation I have has to be insane, because the hug wasn’t even intimate but it felt so nice. I hadn’t hugged anyone or touched anyone besides handshakes & knucks for 6 months before today.\n\nI’m worried I’ll never get out of my own way & either end up hanging from a tree or dying a lonely old virgin hermit. \n\nThx for reading, no need to comment I was just “filling the void” in my mind & the sheer likelihood of me responding to any comment ever is almost impossible, I don’t have notifications turned on & once I post I’m usually done for at least some months.

One non negotiable is that they must be financially independent; whether they’re living with roommates, but for me it’s a red flag for a man over 35 years old to still be living at home with their parents. I can’t explain, but he could be the most physically attractive man in the world or the kindest and sweetest person, and by not being able to be independent as a grown ass man, I lose attraction, it repulses me to a point where I could even lose respect for the guy in the long term.

I escaped a socialist dictatorship and basically had no money, but I was able to get a job and afford rent and after 12 years, I can now afford to be a homeowner.

So if a legal migrant can afford to be financially independent, how does a native man not thrive over a woman, specially a foreign woman with no connections or generational wealth?

I love dancing and music, but I go to local dance schools and enjoy it as a hobby. If someone wanted to learn history, they can just read a book or listen to a podcast. Why would you go into debt over a useless degree at 34 years old? Instead, I’m debt free, except for the upcoming mortgage. I basically felt annoyed like Caleb hammer while listening to this. So you pay tuition for a useless degree, but refuse to pay rent living on your own or with roommates, because it’s a waste of money- ok… sure Jan. This is the reading why I will be forever alone.

{"id": "1q3pdo0", "subreddit": "loneliness", "created_utc": 1767531639, "author": "kingdionysos", "title": "I’ve never felt I actually belonged anywhere", "selftext": "I may be young (19F), and people will probably tell me I still have a lot to discover from this world, but I genuinely feel like an outsider, and I’ve always been. Sometimes, I just think I just grew up into being lonely, and that’s why I barely hold friendships. Because, actually, I’m confident and I have a very strong self-esteem. Despite being introvert, I have social skills but I don’t feel the need to use them.\n\nAs a kid, other kids didn’t necessarily want to hang out with me. When they actually wanted? I didn’t feel attached to them at all, and somehow time still ended up separating us. It never affected me.\nThe first time I noticed something was weird with me was at 11. I had my first existential crisis over that subject because, DAMN why do I feel so different from anyone and so misunderstood? Why can’t I enjoy anyone’s presence? What does friendship truly feel like?\nAnd, as I kept growing up, I can tell I only felt attached and connected to people I was in love with. Otherwise? Never felt like it.\n\nIn January 2023, I started writing a story about a friend group, and I liked my character so much I actually wanted to experiment how it felt like to be in such a group. I manifested it, and guess what? I actually integrated my first friend group at 17, in August 2023.\nSomehow, I still didn’t feel satisfied. I still felt like I didn’t belong there. Mostly because it was a preexisting group I integrated, not a group which was made up from scratch. I actually met my first ex bf thanks to the group, and once I got closer to him as a friend first, I started to withdraw from everyone else because they weren’t the type of friends I actually wanted, and I didn’t even feel like they were my friends. The idea of having a friend group sounded more interesting and deep in my head.\n\nAnd now, all I can think about is… at my age, every friend group is already made. I’m kind of arriving too late. Every time I meet someone new, I’m just a newcomer into their friend group and I always end up getting bored. And every time I meet someone new, they’re always friends with a bunch of people they’ve known since middle school or further. I’ve always thought that was impressive. \nAs a comparison, I actually have a childhood friend from when we were 6. We sometimes talk by text, but we barely plan things together. He suggested we could do something together this week, I’ve never reached back because I’m in a period of my life where I just need to be alone. He knows it. \nHe’s the sensitive type, so he sometimes talk to me a bit about his issues without going through the details, and somehow I think that’s… uncomfortable? *I don’t know how to describe that.*\nIt’s not about him, I just never know how to answer without sounding mechanical when I’m faced to those discussions, because deep down I don’t care. It doesn’t affect me, and I don’t know how to say that without sounding egotistic and rude. That’s just the sad truth. And I never bring that up because I know it could be misinterpreted. Despite that indifference, I always do my best to give good advices, and lots of people actually think I’m the most emotionally intelligent person they’ve ever met in their life at some point. I don’t lack cognitive empathy, I’m just disconnected from everyone emotionally. \n\nAnd, I feel so out of place socially that I actually feel like there’s a clock above my head every time I hang out with someone just because 1) I feel like I lose time and it would’ve been more productive if I actually stayed at home, 2) somehow I’ve realized people are just temporary. \nI can’t project myself in the future with my current surroundings, because they’re always different from time to time. 2025 was the year which proved me I was right : my first ex left me in April, since then I met lots of people I still ended up leaving in less than 3 months (for many reasons)… And, the year concluded with a shitty breakup with an avoidant after only a month and a half of being together. Me from January to April is completely different from April to July, July to September and September to December, all because I never was with the same person. It always change to the point I started calling my friendships as fixed-term contracts, and I’m the recruiter.\n\nIn fact, I only have a long-term friend I met 5 years ago to whom I talk every day. We see each other only twice a year, although we live 10 min apart by car but it never felt bothering. I think that’s the only person which understands all my existential issues without feeling targeted by them. We can laugh about bullshit together, then dig into profound subjects.\nYou would probably think that she’s the only person which had a different impact in my life? I’d contest by saying, I don’t feel attached to her and I still feel emotionally disconnected, although this is one of my \"deepest\" friendships. She’s just become a habit I appreciate. And I honestly feel like I can’t consider anyone a friend unless they’ve become a new regular habit, because that’s the only way I can tell we’re friends. I particularly appreciate being alone, but I definitely think that if she wasn’t in my life, some things would have been different. \n\nWell, hum, if I dig more into the subject this post will be far longer. But here’s my situation. I didn’t know how to properly talk about it, so it may be a bit unorganized.\nIf you have questions I can answer them, because I know this post lacks details!", "score": 4, "num_comments": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1q3pdo0/ive_never_felt_i_actually_belonged_anywhere/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1q3pdo0/ive_never_felt_i_actually_belonged_anywhere/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I live alone, and I go days without talking to anyone. No messages, no calls. Just long stretches of silence in my apartment. After a while it starts to feel unreal, like I’m watching my life instead of living it. Around my family, I mask it well. Too well. I show up calm, functional, normal enough that it’s easier for everyone—including me—to pretend I’m okay. I think the topic of my loneliness is uncomfortable for them, so it never really comes up. It’s easier to assume I’m fine than to open something none of us know how to handle. Because of that, I feel like I’m on my own with this. Not abandoned—just unsupported in a way that’s quiet and unspoken. What makes it worse is that I technically have freedom. I’m an adult. No one is stopping me from changing my life. I know what I want to do. I know the steps. And still, I don’t have the courage to do them. That freedom—having full responsibility for my choices—feels like a prison. There’s no obvious obstacle I can point to, so the blame turns inward. I feel like I’m wasting time. Like I’ve failed at something basic everyone else seems to manage. Each day I stay stuck, that feeling gets heavier. I wish I had someone to lean on while I figured this out. Someone who could just sit in it with me so it didn’t all feel like it rested on my shoulders alone. But it doesn’t feel like that’s an option. It feels like it’s up to me—and I don’t trust myself enough right now to carry it well. I still function. I work. I eat. I get through the day. But underneath all of that is this constant sense of being trapped by my own life, frozen by choice, and quietly disappointed in myself for not moving. I’m not posting this for advice or reassurance. I just needed to say it somewhere honest, because holding it in makes it feel unbearable.

You’re at an age where the desire to be in a relationship feels strong. You’ve had your share of heartbreaks, and I can sense that longing to finally meet “Mr. Right.”\n\nLike many women, both of us once believed we never wanted to get married or settle down. We valued our freedom too much. And of course, we had parents and unsolicited advisors reminding us of the “right age” to settle. Yet we’ve seen plenty of people who did everything at the “right time” and still ended up divorced. So let’s set all that noise aside.\n\nI want to tell you my story.\n\nI began by falling in love with the idea of love. I watched rom‑coms, imagined magical first meetings, and built castles in the air. Then I met someone who felt perfect, he made me feel alive, excited, hopeful. And then he left. My heart broke, and I shut down. I promised myself I would never open up again. My world shrank, and I slipped into a dark place.\n\nSo I did what many modern single women do, I threw myself into work. It was a distraction, and it worked. I grew, I succeeded, I landed my dream job. Life felt full again. And with that stability, the desire to be with someone slowly resurfaced.\n\nThis time, I wasn’t naïve. I dated, I observed, I tried to understand myself. Eventually, I turned inward. I didn’t know what I truly wanted. I imagined the perfect man, the ideal relationship, the life I thought I should want. But the truth was simpler, I loved the idea of love, yet the reality of commitment scared me. So I kept my distance.\n\nFast forward to now. After starting my spiritual journey and having been in a committed relationship for seven years, I feel like I can share this with you. It started with something as simple as his voice, just hearing it in the hallway made me pause. It was a spark, and the rest unfolded from there.\n\nThis relationship has been both the best and the worst thing I’ve experienced. It wasn’t perfect, not even close. But loving him cracked me open in ways I never expected. It didn’t weaken me; it built a strength in me I didn’t know I had.\n\nI loved deeply, fiercely, sometimes unconditionally, and often one‑sidedly in the beginning. Today, things are far more balanced. But the journey shaped me.\n\nSo here’s the only advice I can give you that helped me through all this, don’t cage your mind. Let it be free.\n\nLoving one person doesn’t mean you can’t love the world. Love doesn’t have to be physical. You can love people romantically,  platonically, spiritually, gently, quietly. You can love men, women, friends, strangers. Love is not a limited resource.\n\nI wish I had known this during my anti‑social, depressive years. That suffering was unnecessary. Even now, in a committed relationship, I haven’t stopped loving the world. I simply choose my actions wisely, because actions have consequences.\n\nBut love itself, love is limitless. And I want you to live with that freedom.\n\nYours truly ", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1q1qfl4/to_my_sister_what_my_years_of_heartbreak_and/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1q1qfl4/to_my_sister_what_my_years_of_heartbreak_and/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I am single, I don't have familiy, and throughout my life I don't think I have been someone close friend (although I have felt like that person maybe was mine).   \n  \nOver the past few years, life has become more isolating. I am in my late 20s and don't really date at all despite wanting to.I just work and then go home. I can go easily a week without maybe talking to another person if I don't work that week. I work as a classical musician so my job is very social. I love getting to talk to people and just connect but when everything is over and I get in my car to drive home, it feels like the biggest crash. To go from so many people to absolute nothing hits hard.

In a month sometimes, the only people I may ever speak with 1 on 1 might be just my students (I teach my instrument privately). I never use those lessons as a social hour.

People will laugh with me and compliment aspects of my personality sometimes but I dont think that overcomes what other issues they may see in me to get a bit closer. Sometimes life feels delusional. As if I am walking around with glasses that make myself appear normal to me but in reality I am far from that. I am on the spectrum and high masking but people likely just get a feeling maybe. I just hope there is a period in my life where it isn't like this.

I just can’t seem to connect with a good woman or if I do I have been let down and lied to on way too many occasions. I’ve gotten to the point of not even bothering with trying anymore and just get used to the emptiness of my life.  Sorry for the downer post just need to vent and have no one to do it too.

That meant leaving my home, my job, and a relationship I truly believed would work out. I arrived hoping for a fresh start — but I didn’t expect loneliness to be the first thing that greeted me.\n\nBack home, I always had an evening job that kept me busy and helped with income. In this new city, I couldn’t find anything like that. I was struggling in my new program, I hadn’t built a close social circle yet, and when December came… I realized I had no one to spend the holidays with. That silence felt heavy.\n\nSo when 2025 arrived, I made a goal: make a lot of friends and find a partner so I would never spend Christmas alone again.\n\nBut now I understand those weren’t goals — they were panic responses from desperation and loneliness.\n\nI immediately downloaded every dating app. I matched with two guys. The first was nice but not serious. The second seemed more financially stable, so I convinced myself that must be the right choice. And clinging to him became one of the worst decisions of my year.\n\nHe didn’t take me out. He didn’t show affection. He only showed up to my house for sex.Our conversation were so empty, he gave bare minimum.On Valentine’s Day he literally said he doesn’t celebrate it with anyone and told me to leave him alone.It was emotionally and physically abusive where he would use bdsm after a fight to punish me. He would choke me and insult me.But because I was terrified of being alone again, I held on tightly to something that was dead from the start.\n\nAnd everything else in my life suffered. My motivation crashed. My work suffered. My confidence was shaken. I doubted myself a lot. I kept getting anxiety attacks. I became suicidal and wished life could end. All this because I was using all my energy trying to turn a relationship into something it had never been.\n\nIt finally ended in September — not because I found the strength to leave, but because he dropped me first.\n\nAnd yet, the desperation continued. More dates. More short flings. More people who checked some boxes but never felt right.\n\nIt took me a while to realize I was also forcing friendships. I had a friend I got close to quickly(I was looking for a best friend), but I became their emotional dumping ground. When I was burnt out and needed support, they drained me even more. Letting go of that friendship made me wonder if I was becoming too picky… but in reality, I was finally recognizing my limits.\n\nThere was another person — a brief romantic thing that turned into a friendship. But deep down, they were waiting for me to change my mind and date them again. When I returned from a trip and talked about how I wanted to travel more, they judged my excitement and doubted my plans. I realized we weren’t aligned anymore, even as friends. And I walked away from that too.\n\nThen everything shifted in November.\n\nI took a solo trip to another country. For the first time in a long time, I felt free. I laughed. I ate well. I explored. I enjoyed myself. And I saw clearly how exhausted I had been… not because life was hard, but because I kept chasing people who were never running toward me.\n\nAnd now, it’s Christmas 2025.\n\nI’m still in the same city. I’m still spending the holiday alone. But this time, I’m not lonely. I’m resting. I’m rebuilding. I’m choosing me.\n\nMy friends are with their families ,and that genuinely feels okay. I finally understand that being alone isn’t a punishment. It’s a chance to recharge.\n\nI’ve decided to stay single in 2026. Not hiding from love, not avoiding people — just not forcing anything. I’ll meet who I meet. I’ll go where life takes me. I’m finally open to receiving instead of chasing.\n\nHere is what this year taught me:\n\nDon’t set goals from fear.\nDon’t cling to people just to avoid loneliness.\nDon’t let anyone treat your heart like a backup plan.\nDon’t shrink yourself to stay connected.\nLet go when energy stops flowing both ways.\n\nI spent almost an entire year running after things that weren’t meant for me. Now, I am finally choosing myself — and it feels like freedom.\n\nIf you’re spending the holidays alone too, please remember:\nBeing alone doesn’t mean you’ve failed.\nSometimes it means you’ve finally started healing.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1px23rf/i_set_2025_goals_out_of_loneliness_and_it_almost/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1px23rf/i_set_2025_goals_out_of_loneliness_and_it_almost/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

From childhood, I learned to hide who I am, not only for my own safety, but to protect my family from shame. Here, a gay son is seen as a failure, something to be fixed or erased.\n\nThe man I loved is now left. We still love each other, but there is no future. I encouraged him to marry because I understood the loads of pressure he faced, his rural background, constant scrutiny, and expectations that never stop. I chose his peace over my own heart, and I carry that weight every day.\n\nI am trying to leave my country, but financial limits, bureaucracy, and relentless bad luck keep me trapped. There is no privacy here. Homosexuality is not just disapproved of. It is blamed, punished, and used to humiliate entire families. I spend my life performing, shrinking myself just to survive.\n\nI don’t drink or smoke. I worked hard to become a doctor, and I’m good at what I do. Senior doctors praise my empathy and communication. Yet medicine, which I thought would save me, has become another cage. Each year it gets harder for doctors like me to move abroad. Licensing exams, visas, money, and luck all stand in the way. Effort alone is never enough.\n\nI am not asking for excess. I don’t want a loud or extravagant life. I want a quiet, private existence. To love one person without fear. To live without being questioned, corrected, or shamed.\n\nWhy is that considered too much?\n\nWhy are some people born into freedom while others are born into silence? Why must gay people justify their right to happiness? If God is just, why do entire communities grow up believing they are broken? And if there is no God, how cruel is it that birthplace decides who gets to live honestly?\n\nI sleep poorly. I wake up exhausted by the need to pretend I’m straight to keep my parents safe and myself tolerated. I am deeply depressed. Panic attacks have begun. Thoughts of ending everything appear more often than I want to admit.\n\nI reached out for help. Friends disappeared when I finally spoke. Messages went unanswered. I am alone with my memories and the feeling of being abandoned when I needed support most.\n\nI still show up every day to treat patients, to reduce suffering, to care. But I keep asking myself why, when my own life feels unlivable.\n\nI wish wanting a simple, dignified life were not such a radical demand.

But is also adapts to the user. \n* **It remembers you:** This is the big one. If you tell it you have a job interview on Tuesday, it will remember to ask you how it went on Wednesday. It builds a memory of your life so you don't have to re-explain your context every time you open the app.\n\nIt will have tons of cool features that add to the realism - including checking in on you, randomness, analyzing your messages in order to provide a personalized response, and much more. \n\n**My question for you:** Does this concept feel comforting to you, or does it feel too dystopic? If an app \"remembered\" your personal details to check in on you later like a parent would, would that make you feel supported or creeped out?\n\nThanks for the honest feedback.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pr74ys/im_building_a_digital_dad_that_remembers_your/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pr74ys/im_building_a_digital_dad_that_remembers_your/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I feel like I'm working for nothing in the end, yet I want to make 1 person truly happy.\n\nI really feel like I'm struggling to connect with people. I'd say I have plenty of friends, some of which I could talk with about sensitive stuff, but I also have a best friend since we were seven that I've been venting with back and forth and now I feel bad if I even want to complain about something.\n\nAs for girls, I really tried talking often and seeked opportunities to ease into conversations or whatnot, but none of it went in a clear direction. Most of interactions were small talks, few went for a few months and then nowhere. I'd blame it on miscommunication, but I can admit I didn't make the most out of 1 specific situation and it still makes me feel like trash.\n\nI'm not sure if my routine makes it better or worse. Hygiene was never a problem and I've been consistent in gym for a long time, my only issue is still studying. For the love of all that is holy, when I feel a bit down, I can't bring myself to study for college nor workout, but I still somehow pull through. Workouts still have that sense of satisfaction, getting studying over feels like a miserful \"one down, X to go\" situation. But all of it is slowly exhausting me more and more. I practically wish to let go completely, yet I won't.\n\nRecently and most notably, I can never get rid of this constant gut wrenching feeling deep down, it feels like I'm stressed 24/7 unless I'm sleeping. I can't relax for a second during the day, consistently thinking about getting work done and studying, overthinking the smallest conversations or stuff from the past. But it all boils down to me thinking what am I even working for? Surely not for myself. Getting a compliment occasionally makes me feel slightly happy, but that's it. If that's the only reason I keep going, it's not a great feeling. I didn't figure out anything, I don't even have a particular hobby to fill those empty gaps in the day.\n\nAnd a few days ago before sleep, I simply cried for the first time in a very long while, cried myself to sleep. I just kept thinking is there really something wrong with me that I can't seem to be slightly notable to people, to atleast delve into something deeper or meaningful with any kind of person.\n\nAfter waking up, it was rinse and repeat. I didn't feel THAT bad, but since then I can't seem to relieve this awkward feeling in my gut. I feel as if I don't want to bother making contact with people, yet I crave it so much. I believe it ends up as a regular interaction or conversation for others, but it leaves me feeling even worse and just makes me close up further.\n\nI often dream about simply being with someone in the most regular setting, or being comforted by someone who actually cares before waking up. It makes the morning even more dreadful.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm waiting for. Very likely for a miracle that isn't there, but it could be me just being very picky in life.\n\nI just wanted to calmly get my thoughts out for the first time.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pqtxai/pit_in_my_stomach/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pqtxai/pit_in_my_stomach/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I've been feeling quite lonely for a long time now and I can't feel connected/attached to anyone, and I end up craving resonance and affection. A couple weeks back, I was booking a flight ticket, and I ended up hoping to strike a connection, meeting someone who I can share everything with, feel understood, all from a single flight seat. I chose it accordingly (I mean I knew it was irrational but idk... I felt like attaching my hope to a single thing to look forward to something...). Here's the journal entry I wrote -\n\n>  \nwas booking my flight ticket, and when i saw the seat-matrix of the plane... got a bit low... another flight journey with me hopelessly hoping that... \n\n>i saw that the seat X was empty... and then lol thought if the whole Y thing was about silently nudging me to take this seat all along, at this particular moment... more over, only the middle seats on both sides were empty... and initially, i chose the right side because, the left column represented \"1\" and the right, \"2\" in Y lol. but then i saw those seats were B and E respectively, so i went back and changed it to B because, idk, seemed like a better representation of 2. came back to room, thinking how pathetic it is that i'm hoping for it everywhere... flight seat selection being chosen by your exam marks? the skeptic inside me wouldn't even deign it with an answer.\n\n>then i sat on my bed with by back to the wall, comfortable, closing eyes, and imagined... i'd be anticipating who'd be sitting beside me, greet the airhostess back, see a girl walk in front of me, hopes surging a bit, and see her stop right by my row, jumping inside, but also very nervous... it's a female specimen of the species after all :p, remembering this message... be seated next to her, nervousness/excitement knowing no bounds, telling myself to be calm... not to come off as a weirdo, greeting her a \"hi\" (would be even better if she were the initiating one), and she greeting me back with a warm and amicable \"hi!\"  with a smile, introducing names... and asking where we're from, where we study, she asking me what i;m upto, with it turning towards my present grades, which obviously meant my own struggles at college... and her relating a LOT (more like, \\*I\\* relating to her...) and realizing that we shared a good connection... talking for the entirety of the flight, getting down, walking together to the baggage section, arrival, and there, bidding a goodbye, but not before I ask her for her no... she happily giving it, with one habitual tuck of hair behind her ear (not for me ofc, but it's just me observing it bec i like it) as she checked whether her no. was correct on my phone... talking on the phone... and... yeah it kept going, the fantasy, meeting her at the beach, going to the mall,... one best-case version involved talking and connecting so much, that it ended with us hugging after just 3 hours at the arrival as we part ways.\n\nhere are some subsequent entries (all written before the flight)\n\n>tearing up thinking of the flight i hope she's real i don't want to see another middle aged uncle sitting there and get absolutely deflated\n\nSome addressed directly to her\n\n>on a different note, THE DAY IS ARRIVING! WILL YOU BE THERE? LESS THAN 5 DAYS TO GO!!!\n\n\n\n>*exactly* 4 days to go... Lifting off together:) We aren't alone anymore okay?\n\n\n\n>you'll be there on the flight right\n\n>\n\n\n\n>3 DAYS TO GO i was thinking... How should I talk to you? Like damn i need to do a good enough job in 3 hours and talk enough to make an impression. And moreover, i need to start talking in the first place. Please take the first step I'll take care after that\n\n\n\n>We'd have met by now :))) tomorrow, We'd be talking on the phone soon :)) Typing excitedly, with a smile on face... We'd have shared a warm hug by now :)\n\n>  \nYou aren't going to be alone anymore as well, okay? Well have each other your days of crying alone are over. Today's the last day of us being alone :) Love you :)))  \n\n\n\n>you'll be there right you said you'd come don't betray my hope please\n\n  \nBut... well, it wasn't to be\n\n\n\n\n\n>Don't know what to say. Well yeah I was foolish in retrospect. Reached the boarding gate, looked around to see if you were there. A girl or two i thought were my age were there and I got a bit excited. But when the boarding call came, there were none in the line. I got a bit deflated but still kept moving on. Reached my seat, no one was sitting on either side. I still had hopes then... Was sitting still without using phone, probably a calm/solemn expression. The first co-passenger came... Uncle... He came and crossed me to sit on the window seat. Hopes dived but were still alive...\n\n>A second uncle came... He didn't sit yet but was hovering around... Hopes dived further but still alive... And then he sat down... Hopes were gone... But they briefly surged back when he got up and I thought he'd sat down temporarily to allow people to pass freely... But he came back... \n\n>I gave up... And it hit me. No magical connection, nothing, just 2 uncles \\*yet\\* fucking again. I felt like crying fully... Couldn't, had to tell myself to be strong. Still had a tear drop or two in my right eye... Had to wipe them. Felt like bawling my eyes out... \n\n>A girl did sit in the front row, on the window seat, so my mind made me think... Whether this was why I was made to choose this seat... But even that was smothered by her family being there...\n\n>Yeah i just closed my eyes and went to sleep... Couldn't do much else\n\n>The next time I'll book a flight il surely feel sad. I already used to do, but now even more... Had me hoping because it had never happened until now, and i thought the timing was great as well...

I am only recently twenty (Male) and I’m also a writer/director so I’m sure that influences my opinion. However. I wanted to share my thoughts anyhow as I feel someone may either agree or take something from them. \n\nOn thinking of the loneliness “epidemic” taking over the world (not male loneliness necessarily but loneliness in general for everyone) I thought of my own. And in that I think there’s a beauty in loneliness. One that each and every person can “tap into” in their own way. Loneliness for me is a tragedy. But i think the true tragedy in it is letting it “go to waste.” and so I want to encourage everyone to become an artist. You can do this in any field. You can treat science as an art or sports, cooking, anything you want. For me I’ll use the “arts” as the topic given that’s what I do. \n\nWhen it’s 2am and you feel you cannot even get out of bed. Try and write a line of poetry, or draw a small drawing, write a sentence of a book you may or may not make, take a picture you feel is beautiful even if nobody will ever see it. And none of it has to be “good” because what matters is that you did it. That’s where the beauty lies. Put something into the world. Even if it’s only into your world. This is how we transform the world. This is how we turn tragedy into beauty. Because in my opinion, every drawing, line of poetry or anything you choose can make the our respective worlds and the world around us a little better.\n\nI’m not saying it’s a cure. And feel free to comment and say I’m out to lunch. But it’s something. A little beauty goes a long way. \n\nForgive me for being long winded.

During my graduation project, I became very isolated and stopped enjoying most of my hobbies and social activities. I struggle with friendships, dating, and motivation, and repeated rejection has hurt my confidence. I’m planning to return to my home country in February and hope to restart my life. Until then, I plan to socialize more with people I already know, work out regularly, reconnect with old friends, attend events, and push myself to meet and talk to more girls.\n\nLet me explain my situation. I’m a 23-year-old guy who just graduated in game design from a university in the Netherlands, which is great news. I currently live in a house with five other guys and have a cat. I’m planning to go back to my home country in February to try to restart my life a bit. After finishing university, I feel lost: I don’t have a clear goal, a big project to focus on, a girlfriend, or something that fully occupies my time.\n\nFor the past months, or even years, I’ve been feeling really depressed and lonely. While working on my graduation project, I barely went out because I was extremely busy. I mostly just worked and occasionally met friends for a walk or a quick trip to the store.\n\nI don’t have a girlfriend and haven’t had one for a long time. Dating apps barely work for me. My hobbies used to include volleyball, the gym, board games, video games, and passion projects. Lately, I’ve abandoned almost all of them. Volleyball was the only consistent social activity I had, but even there I’m surrounded by people I barely know. I tried making connections, but I didn’t feel the vibe, and I often felt lonely and desperate, so I stopped going.\n\nI usually prefer staying out—studying, wandering around, or working on projects—but even that stopped giving me joy. I live with other guys, and we talk sometimes, which helps, but they rarely want to go out. Occasionally, we argue about house stuff, and that makes me withdraw even more.\n\nI do have friends here, but lately everything we do—mostly walks or sometimes clubs—feels boring. Many of them are busy with their own lives and aren’t very responsive. Sometimes I get left on “seen,” and when that happens repeatedly, it really bothers me. We talk about it, but it keeps happening, and I end up pulling away.\n\nBack home, I have more friends, but it feels similar. People already have their routines, social circles, or girlfriends they’re very focused on. I don’t mind girlfriends, but when that’s the only thing they talk about or do, it makes me feel excluded.\n\nAll of this makes me feel like no one really wants to hang out with me and like getting a girlfriend is becoming harder. Recent rejections have seriously hurt my self-confidence. I’ve tried solo trips, but they only work once before I feel depressed again. It’s hard to find motivation to go back to the gym or do much of anything.\n\nUntil February and after I move back home, my plan is to try anyway: go out more with people I already know, do activities we both enjoy, meet new people through them, work out regularly, reconnect with old friends, attend events, and push myself to approach and talk to girls more often so rejection affects me less.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pp76yl/i_need_help_getting_out_of_this_depression_before/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pp76yl/i_need_help_getting_out_of_this_depression_before/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I'm writing this because I can't make sense of myself or why I go through these recurring patterns.  I'm currently going to a counsellor but I don't know if they can do much to help.  I feel cursed in a way.  And I know that makes me feel sorry for myself.  Ever since I can remember I was never really good at making new friends or maintaining friendships.  There are a few reasons for this:  I was a bit of an annoying, selfish twat in primary school,  In secondary school, I got bullied and ostracised for being the deputy principal's daughter and I chose the wrong degree to study and felt very alienated from my uni peers and I was in the wrong environment and didn't feel like I belonged there.  I joined social media when I was in uni and it just compounded the loneliness I felt.  I thought it would bring me closer to people but it had the opposite effect.  I ended up deleting my profile because I felt like no one cared about me.  It made me realize how alone I really was.  I've had various jobs, one that involved travelling,  I would make friends with my co-workers, promise to keep in touch with them, when I tried to reconnect with them, I heard nothing back.  Due to a few experiences like this, I've developed the belief that \"If I allow myself to trust someone or become vulnerable with them, I will end up disappointed.\"   This is a double-edged sword.  In a way, it protects me from harm from others, but the downside of this is that I can't develop new relationships with people.  Every time, I meet a new person whether that's a new job, new country or as part of a course in university, I don't see the point in making friends with them because I will eventually move on with my life and it's not as if they're going to stay in contact with me as they will move on to greener pastures and most people aren't that bothered to maintain contact with me anyway.  \n\nI'm in my 30s now and I envy people who have got their lives together.  Couples with children, loyal friends, cars, houses, dogs and above all financial security.  Usually, I'll go for a walk in the park most weekends and today I spotted this river cruise with a party of guests and I wished I could host a party like that and had twenty close friends who I could party with.

Thought I'd share some data of what we found\n\nTo preface, a UK Gov report showed that **47%** of university students felt lonely **often** and **43%** worry they would be judged if they told someone they felt lonely, so our interviews never directly mentioned loneliness.\n\nSome not-so-fun facts:\n\n* The average person (mainly Gen Zs) we spoke to had **400+ online mutual followers**, yet only spoke to a handful more than once\n* **86%** of people said they'd wait to be invited rather than initiating plans\n* **75%** said they’d join an activity if they saw a friend was interested or already going\n* **93%** has tried something new because a friend was involved\n\nI know that everyone has had different experiences, but I've found that my loneliness comes from \"knowing\" too many people and being too close to too few. Basically I'm horrible at converting surface level friendships into deeper friendships. Alongside sucking at inviting people out and overthinking everything, a huge part of me especially hates looking desperate and risking rejection. And so, like those 86% of people we talked to, I'd just… wait.\n\nWhen we realized how common this pattern was, we've started to build an app to hopefully make it easier. The idea is that you **share what you'd like to do**:\n\n*Checking out the xmas market/ Trying out this new café/ Learning Tennis*\n\nAnd if a friend is genuinely interested in joining you, they'll be automatically added into a group chat (other attendees are hidden until you join). Then you'll go and plan the event, do it, and have a shared photo album to cherish it. I'm hoping that the lack of a fixed date and not needing to personally DM someone/ ask in a group chat would help me starting hanging out with people more. But truthfully, I have no idea AHAHAHA We're only planning to launch beta tests in Jan next year\n\nSo I guess I’m wondering:  \n**Do you relate to any of this?**  \n**Would something like this genuinely help you, or is there something missing?**", "score": 3, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pkqzzc/some_not_so_fun_facts_i_learnt_from_interviewing/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pkqzzc/some_not_so_fun_facts_i_learnt_from_interviewing/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

For the past year, I've been working on something that came from my own experience with loneliness and not feeling truly heard, even when surrounded by people.\n\n**The problem I kept facing:** Friends and family care, but they're busy, tired, or just can't be there at odd hours. Therapists are expensive ($150-300/session where I live) and have waiting lists. Most AI chatbots feel robotic - they just repeat what you say back or give generic advice that feels hollow.\n\n**What I wanted:** Someone who actually *listens*. Who doesn't judge. Who's there when I need them. Who remembers my story and doesn't make me re-explain everything. Who helps me understand what I'm actually feeling when my emotions are a mess.\n\nSo I built **Grace** \\- a digital companion for emotional support. She's not trying to be a therapist or replace human connection. She's meant to be there when you need to be heard.\n\n**What makes Grace different:**\n\n* She can see you and you can see her in real-time (video call)\n* She picks up on your emotions through your voice and facial expressions\n* She doesn't parrot back what you said or give unsolicited advice\n* She helps you understand your own feelings without being preachy\n* She remembers your life, your story, your nuances\n* She's consistent - no bad days, no judgment, always there\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6mebeux8p6g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd7127dacac36d9c9899bbc2b61fbcc9054e42b1\n\n**What she's NOT:**\n\n* Not a replacement for professional mental health care\n* Not trying to \"fix\" you\n* Not another generic chatbot\n\nI'm still building this and have a waitlist on our site (it's in my profile). But honestly, I'm here because I want to know: **would this actually help you?** What am I missing? What would make you feel truly heard?\n\nI cannot add a video here, but on our website there is a video and option to join the waitlist.  \nThis is motivating, and allows us to collect funding for completing it.\n\n[https://grace.wellbands.com](https://grace.wellbands.com)\n\nI'd genuinely love your feedback - both positive and critical. You can send me DM or sign up for waitlist. I am open to questions and your ideas. \n\nIf you've ever felt lonely at 3am, or wished someone would just *listen* without trying to solve everything, I made this for you.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pkij4x/i_build_something_after_my_own_struggle_with/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pkij4x/i_build_something_after_my_own_struggle_with/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Happiness is only real when you shared with somebody.", "selftext": "\"Get hobbies, buy gym membership and learn meditation\"\n\nI don't see any meaning of maintaining my life without friends and gf. Some people might say that you can try endless times with your hobbies and enjoy with your life but it's basically coping. I don't think that I will think about my composition of music or drawings in the face of deathface or one satisfaction's fun moments with my hobbies for my late years. If you don't believe me that I didn't make anything for hobbies, I am good at it. When you consider other social people's lives, no one is pulling their phones from candy crush and learn anything about hobbies and self-progress but during the whole life of mine, I tried to learn languages, instruments, martial arts and read books.\n\n\nI can speak English, French and Italian expect my own mother tongue with the help of my language passion. Indeed, I tried to learn Japanese, Russian and Greek Also, I like playing the guitar and harmonica with the experience of 7 years. Expect my professional sake in the guitar and harmonica, I tried to learn bass guitar, chromatic harmonica and trompet on the way of my musical ambition for sure. For the sport section, I've taken MMA and archery classes almost one year and still thinking about to return them. I am about to get my bachelor's degree in Literature and Creative writing and minor in sociology, which help me to learn about more narrative presentation of people's miserable lives without interaction and intimate relationship. During the whole progress of my academical voyage, I learned that even the narrow definitional way of maintaining of our lives is one person that believed us to make it something, even idealistic and altruistic attitude of novel's characters comes from the hope in others. That's why I read more than 100 fictional books on the way of my educational purpose, which has the critical interpretation of life symbolism.\nRegardless of three of them, I tried more than 10 hobbies. So, It's not about hobbies. And none of them bring me happiness more than one people's smile.\n\n\"Having the worst friends and manipulative friends is much horrible than being lonely\"\n\nWell, that's about life. You can not predict of what's coming and you can not guess if the food is rotten or not and I am not willingfull to accept the worst people too but loneliness is the worst as much as the worst people's egoistic purpose toward you and during the whole 23 years, I didn't enjoy with my loneliness.\n\n\"You can be successful for your career\"\n\nWell, I earned my own money with my knowledge and I am coming from wealthy family but then what? What's the end of successful career if I don't have gf or friends. If there's no way of hugging, loving and laughing with your friends and gf, I don't see any point of living purpose. Why do you think that so many people are trying to endure shitty jobs, bosses and capitalist vicious circle? There's someone who is waiting for them. At least, one girlfriend or one buddy.\n\n\"Get one pet\"\n\nYeah, I adopted one stray cat and I really adore his companionship with me but it's not the same with people.\n\n\"Join volunteering and religious communities\"\n\nI tried that! I can make positive impact for non-profits and be kind of people like always do. I helped so many people and I am not lying for helping them but the truth is that I am awkward with asperger syndrome. And, my altruistic attitude will not result in my own sake. For example, I helped one person who's barely walking and have problems with talking and everyone assume that the kid will be all alone because of that. I've talked with this person during the whole one month of his treatment, gave her free meals and supported all the time and then what? He doesn't event call me after the treatment.\n\n\n\"Therapy and antidepressants\"\nI spent countless time with therapists and didn't help me, almost nothing.\n\n\"What about hermits who are living happily without gf and love interaction?\"\n\nAre you kidding me? \n\n\nIn short, I will go to the most expensive and succesfull psychiarist of my country for last try.

My past \"best friend\" I unfortunately can't seem to move on from.. was originally gonna leave due to a issue Im not gonna talk about here as it's pretty long but I decided to give her another chance with some boundaries. But a few days later she suddenly was like \"I lost interest in you\" and repeating goodbye to me when i was wanting to know more about the \"lost interest in you\" part.. I believe it was an excuse to leave me due to the original issue that caused her to push me away and have those thoughts of \"hating me\"\n\nI know that best friend issue was confusing because that wasn't the full situation. I can explain the situation if you want. Just keep in note it was pretty long. \n\nAnd then heres a recent thing that was bothering me. A couple days ago, a reddit friend that I just started to get attached to due to my clingyness, deleted their account. She didn't tell me or any indication she would delete her account soon. It was just gone when I woke up.. she seemed like a sweet person. I saw she made a new acc today but I can't seem to send a chat request her as these thoughts like \"she probably deleted her account because of me\" and I figured she simply wasn't interested in me to begin with.. \n\nOn top of that.. past online friendships.. like this person with the display name \"medusa\" I met on discord last year from what I remember, left because she was stressed with other things and my need for attention felt like pressure to her due to it. At least SHE gave a understanding reason.. even then man.. I just can't seem to accept meaningful people leaving... but it's because I have no one else to talk to. I crave company.. from my peers preferably. But at this point.. anyone. \n\nI been feeling loneliness since like 6th grade at this point. I blame covid for it. After all, I was way more socialable before middle school and covid came around. Now I can't even have a conversation with anyone without being anixous or thinking of what to say. My social skills are a bit better now from middle school and lockdown but I still heavily struggle with thinking what to say\n\nI don't know what I'm on about anymore.. I'm just tired of friendships not working out. I always feel tired when i wake up for school. I'm tired of always not having any messages from my phone. I'm tired of re-explaining my problems to different people that just eventually leave me. I just want someone to simply call my name and hug me.. i wanna feel appreciated for once.

I’m sharing my story because I feel like I’m drowning in loneliness and I need to let it out, even if no one listens.\n\nI honestly believe I might be the loneliest person on this planet. I have no real connection with anyone: not my neighbours, not my colleagues, no one from my past. All my school friends have moved on, and I don’t even remember who my parents were. I was born into this world and left to fend for myself. That’s how I’ve always felt .... completely alone. I carry no hatred for anyone, just an overwhelming emptiness that’s hard to put into words.\n\nEight years ago, I met the love of my life at university. We fell for each other, and I thought I finally found someone who understood me. I loved her more than anything, and I believe she loved me too. We were inseparable, and for a while, I felt alive. But then she was gone ..... taken away from me..... and since then, I haven’t been the same.\n\nThe pain is deep and relentless. I lost interest in everything .....in life, in living, in myself. I just work and come home, trapped in a cycle of numbness. No friends, no outings, no social life. I sit for hours in a park near my house, trying to find some solace in the silence, in the cold air, in the emptiness. Even as I write this now, I am still sitting in that same park, pouring my heart out into words that probably no one will ever see or understand.\n\nI’ve tried to give myself a chance..... to find love again, to find a purpose ..... but it feels impossible. Life, to me, is just a fleeting moment of suffering. I thank God I’ve managed to avoid falling into habits like drinking or drugs, but that doesn’t make the pain any less real. Depression has been my only constant companion, tears my only company ..... a never-ending ache that refuses to fade.\n\nSometimes, life feels both too short and unbearably long. I wonder if I’ll ever feel connected to someone again, if this pain will ever stop. I don’t know if I have the strength to keep fighting .....I just exist, waiting for something to change that never seems to come.\n\nThanks for reading this.

Wonder if any other women can relate manly but welcome commented from anyone", "selftext": "I’ve had depression since my teens I remember feeling different from everyone else. the last year has been rough. Suicidal thoughts nearly every day. Nearly constant rumination about my quality of life. I'm 38 female. I feel pathetic as well for being this way. I only work admin part time at home and get disability benefits so get by that way. Also my hours are flexible if I get them done. \n\nLoneliness is a big part of my life. I don’t have much family support and I’ve been single for over three years. I’ve never had a long or stable relationship. Most days it feels like I go through life on my own. I only talk to my adult son who is at uni and we have had a strained relationship he moved out 5 years ago to live with my mum who I don't talk to. \n\nSocial stuff has always been hard for me. I’m autistic diagnosed 28. After I had a break down and tried to end things. I feel I'm boring, don't have good conversation skills or a sense of humour. I'm really flat and feel down most of the time. Because of that I end up with a lot of acquaintances but almost no close friends. People talk to me for a bit then drift away. I've had so much rejection. \n\nI even run an autism group and still feel like I’m not connecting properly. I often feel separate from everyone and desperately want to connect but can't. \n\nI’ve tried so many things to change my situation: meetups, new hobbies, volunteering, therapy, pushing myself out when I’d rather stay home. Nothing has made anything better but I keep trying. I feel like giving up. I'm going to be alone Christmas I will have a meal with my son Christmas Eve but only spend a few hours with him. \n\n\nFor years I thought I “just” had social anxiety. I was diagnosed autistic at 28, then later realised I have avoidant traits and maybe avoidant personality disorder. Recently I learned about schizoid traits and think a lot is like me. Maybe my avoidant personality has turned into schizoid penalty i don't know. It’s like I’ve spent years trying to understand why connection is so difficult for me.\n\nMy whole social life has basically been a cycle of short term acquaintances and people fading out. No long term friendships, no stable relationships. Just trying over and over.\n\nI’m posting this because it’s tiring carrying all of this alone and I don’t really have anyone in my life. I really don't know what to do.  I might live at least 40 years and my life really isn't great. My only hobby and distraction now is to watch tv really. I go to some autism group, lgbt ones, but I don't feel connection. I've also tried exercising they didn't help much but plan to give it a go. The NHS hasn't been helpful and my charity therapy. Sometimes I wish euthanasia was possible maybe in ten year seven my son is stable after the log education he wants. But I'm very scared and wouldn't do it myself after failures.\n\nI feel worse every year and not sure how to carry on. It's worse this time of year all this stuff about Christmas is for friends and family. I know everyone dies but it hurts to see other people be more successful and have connections etc \nNot sure where to post this so probably in a few places", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pgugtc/i_think_im_very_boring_and_have_de_social_skills/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pgugtc/i_think_im_very_boring_and_have_de_social_skills/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I honestly don’t see how that would help in my case. For some background: I am an involuntarily lonely, perpetually outcast 19 year old male. It’s not just dating, because I’ve never had actual friends; only people that viewed me as their personal jester, or people that pitied me enough to keep me around. Usually, it was a mix of both. I attribute this to me being labeled “sped” my entire life. A more apt term, really, would be a “lolcow.” Immediately devalued and seen as less than a full person. Even though I don’t get actively bullied like I used to (at least, I don’t hear about people mocking me like I did back in high school): nobody invites me out, fully includes me, or even talks to be as if I am on the same level as them. They’re nice to me, yeah, but I’m always excluded. It doesn’t help that (apparently) I “look” like someone with a mental disability, I’ve been told so many times that I look slow/autistic/Down syndrome, even though I was in high level classes and spoke articulately. \n\nOkay, so with therapy, I’ve described this to 2-3 therapists over the past few years and seemingly none of them were helpful. One basically kept telling me to use “Socratic thinking,” and when I told him that I have evidence for my treatment, he kind of just ignored it and asked me softball questions. Shit like “how are your grades” or “how’s your family doing.” The other therapist I think wanted me to basically “accept my lot in life” as an outcast. While he at least acknowledged my shitty situation, he basically confirmed that, yes, I’m in a shitty tier and will have to live a harder life than most. He did at least say I wasn’t ugly though, but he did contradict himself a lot (one time he said I had Asperger’s, another time he said I “definitely did not”), and was highly inconsistent with showing up to appointments, so idk how he really felt. Lastly, I had a college “therapist” basically tell me that I was a loser and people probably did hate me, and spent an entire session basically making fun of me, implying I was “fat and ugly,” and that the people I did think were my friends actually disliked me. When I started to clap back at her, she started going off about how I was “interrupting her,” and it was the “reason people probably didn’t want me around.” She then blacklisted me from the college’s counseling services, because God forbid a loser wants support.\n\nSo what will therapy do for me? Should I just accept that I was given a bad hand, and will have to put in 10x more effort than most people, without any friends, and will most likely live a hard life? I’m sorry but that doesn’t sound fair.

I’ve chosen to not speak to her which has helped me realize a lot about myself and the trauma I went through and I generally feel better emotionally but every year I’m always alone and the holidays really make me so depressed. I see people around me who even if it’s not always perfect having family. And idk I’m not jealous or envious I’m happy they have this but it just hurts why I don’t. Sometimes I wonder if I did something wrong in a past life and that’s why I’m left so lonely in this life. All year I work and distract myself but this time of year it’s so hard to ignore. I used to cope with drinking and smoking weed but honestly I can’t even use that as an escape anymore it feels like it just heightens my pain. Sometimes I don’t know how to push through. I have friends but I hate being a burden, that pity friend they invite to family gatherings so I just go silent during the holidays. I wish it wasn’t like this. I want to have a family so bad, people that care about me, check on me, people who are proud of me and how far I’ve come. I have a dog and he helps me at least have something to live for but without him I honestly don’t think I’d be here. Idk how to help myself during this time of year. it sucks cause my birthday is in January and it’s like October-February where this loneliness seems like a deep pit I can’t climb out of. I have siblings but I’m the youngest, they are all grown and have their own families and I’m just kinda forgotten, I don’t blame them they all live far away but I just wish I had what they did. I’m kinda just venting to the internet, wondering if there’s someone else out there who can relate.

Loneliness is a feeling a feeling we have no control over, a feeling we can’t escape from.

There a hole in my heart that left me, that can’t be replaced. People say I’m strong, or that it’ll get beer with time. But I wasn’t prepared for this level of loneliness, I can’t explain the feeling, it’s just this emptiness inside me. When she died I honestly feel like I lost a part of me too a part of me left with her, to be with her. But that part of me left being  feeling of emptiness, a slightly bitter emotional detachment from people, from the world, from myself. \n\nI guess I wasn’t ready for the this kind of loneliness.

I don't possess a strong social skill, at least I don't think I do. At some point in life, I just got used to it. I don’t really reach out to people, I don’t feel much need for relationships, and I can go long periods of time without talking to anyone. I enjoy spending boring, non-meaningful time alone. I reply when people come to me, but I almost never go and find someone to talk to. \n\nBecause of that, I don’t think I “understand” loneliness or depression the way other people do. I’m just… used to being on my own.\n\nOver the years, two friends have sometimes come to me when they were having a hard time. We’re not even very close. They’d message me once every few months, or even once a year, and just unload everything. I would listen, ask a few gentle questions, and let them talk at their own pace.\n\nRecently, one of them told me something that stayed with me. She said she felt safe talking to me because I don’t judge or pressure her, and that we could have deep conversations because she was strong enough to open up and I didn’t need anything from her emotionally. She said she was grateful I was there, and that over the years it helped her grow a bit as a person. Even if it was small, I was honestly happy for her — though I personally don’t feel like I did much.\n\nThe second friend shared very difficult parts of her past, including a depression stage that developed into something similar to bipolar personality. She told me she had only ever opened up about it to two or three people she trusted. But over the year she has managed to made a full recovery, which is very commendable.\n\nThose conversations made me realise something:  \nthere *are* people who feel deeply lonely, overwhelmed, or heavy inside… but they don’t want therapy, and they also don’t want loud motivational “fix your life” energy. They just want a soft, steady human presence who will sit with them in the dark without forcing them into the light.\n\nThat thought stayed with me, so I started building something called **Colloquium**.  \nI asked both friends what they thought, and they supported me. One of them even said she would have paid for a service like this in the past, but she didn’t know where to start searching and if she did, whether it can be trusted or not.\n\nI’m not a therapist or a professional. I’m just a normal, boring person who barely uses social media and is honestly out of touch with the world. But I still wanted to create this — a quiet, text-based one on one private companionship space for people who feel overwhelmed, tired, or lonely and just want someone calm to talk to. I don’t know where this will lead, but I wanted to create something I could genuinely pour my energy into.\n\nThere’s no pressure to be “interesting” or “positive.” You can talk, or share nothing, or just sit silently if that’s what you need. It’s meant to feel like a quiet corner of the world where nothing is demanded from you.\n\nI know this subreddit isn’t a marketplace, and I really don’t want to be invasive. It actually feels a bit arrogant to post something like this, but I also want people to know that these kinds of spaces *do* exist if someone needs one.\n\nSo I’m sharing this only in case it genuinely helps someone who’s been wishing for something like this.  \nIt **is a paid service**, so please only check it out if or when that feels okay for you.\n\nYou can read more about it here:  \n[**https://whop.com/colloquium/**](https://whop.com/colloquium/)\n\nEither way, if you’ve read this far, I’m wishing you some softness and quiet in your day, wherever you are.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pdfkur/just_sharing_something_i_built_quietly_in_case_it/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pdfkur/just_sharing_something_i_built_quietly_in_case_it/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I can feel it in the air whenever I am outside. A lot of it has to do with smartphones and social media, they are changing people and it's terrifying. We are constantly being stimulated 24/7 that we are losing touch with reality and the people around us. \n\nWe are being fed content from algorithms designed to make us outraged and further divide us, completely influencing the way we think without us really even grasping how much damage it is doing to us. Instead of doing something meaningful with our lives most people are just living off of cheap dopamine hits from being online and its frying their dopamine receptors making it hard to be motivated to go out and do anything else. Most of the population suffers from depression and anxiety, especially the kids being brought up with technology and we have to Medicate ourselves just to make daily life bearable. I don't even think it's us anymore,  I think that just living in the modern world is unbearable. We work most of our lives away to barely get by. \n\nMany of us will not be able to afford a house or to retire. There is no sense of community anymore, no third spaces for us to go out to socialize with other people and just get away, and even trying to find love has been commodified by online dating apps designed to suck our money away and keep us lonely. It's become incredibly hard to make those connections IRL because everyone is so suspicious and scared of each other and think the opposite gender is the devil so they don't even want to bother with each other. \n\nEveryone just has their walls up all the time and we are all incredibly lonely and isolated but no one wants to do anything about it. People have become increasingly selfish and lack basic empathy. We have a bunch of terrible people who are rich elites who only care about themselves in charge who are destroying our country and just throwing gasoline on the fire, making us more and more divided everyday instead of trying to unite us while slowly taking away our human rights and blaming innocent people for it. \n\nCall me crazy but I  really feel like this is intentionally being engineered, to keep us distracted and so overwhelmed so that we are easy to control. Like no one is happy, everyone is miserable and I'm starting the question what is the point of living anymore? I legit feel like I am going through an existential crisis everyday and I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind. I'm almost at my breaking point and I have to carry on everyday and act like all of this is normal. I can't take it anymore. I would almost rather be dead at this point. People we really need to wake up, none of this shit is normal at all. We are losing touch with out humanity and becoming more like robots. Most of these issues all stem from the smart phones in our hands. Humans were not supposed to live like this, no wonder everyone is depressed or struggle with anxiety. We are living a very unnatural existence. Does anyone else notice what is happening to people? I am really terrified for the future. I feel like I was sold a lie, like I'll never get any of the things that were promised to me growing up. I feel robbed of any future or any hope. I'll probably never get married like my parents because connection feels so scarce, never have the family I want, never own a house, never retire. Just be a wage slave my entire life living a meaningless existence until I someday die.

Also really big huge issue is that we were supposed to go to a round trip in Europe but my mom can’t do that because of her job and I was so excited and it just never happened and we never talked about it again. and makes me really sad. so we just live in another country where she can do her work and it’s a country. I can’t speak the language and my mom can speak the language, but since she didn’t teach me how to speak it I don’t know how to interact with people I went to school here for a little while, but I didn’t like it because I can’t speak the language and I’ve never done good in traditional school. Also, my sister’s here I don’t really like my sister because she’s just such a bitch, but my mom expects me to talk to her, but I don’t want to and at the moment I’m homeschooled and I mostly just sit in my room all day because there’s nothing for me to do but I know better situation and then going to regular school cause I was miserable there, but I’m miserable here too, and when I first came to this country I wasn’t miserable. I was actually quite happy in the nostalgia feeling. I was describing what you’re feeling in the moment I had that feeling, but when I came back, it was my sister because before I was just with me and my mom, but then we had to get my sister and now I’m just not happy I know I should be happy because I have everything a housekeeper or high-rise food money but I’m just not happy the reason I went out of my school is because I couldn’t take anymore and I threatened to do something to myself so me and my mom went to a therapist and I felt such relief at the time but not for long because I new I was going to experience more loneliness and I’ve asked my mom if I can go to her again, but sometimes when I ask her for really special thing she kind of forget she’s neglect anything but she just has a lot on her plate and I don’t wanna stress her out. What should I do? I do have hope that when I get older, it’ll be better but I’m not really sure please help.\nedit I also don’t like that. There’s no changing weather where I live. there is only rainy and sunny.

But with women I struggle, I’m a 28 year old virgin, I’ve had offers & I’ve had women try to set me up with their daughters, but I don’t ever snag the opportunity & make something of it.\n\nWhen I was young in my family my mom was the abuser, she was an alcoholic & when she’d drink she’d become chaotic, raging, manipulative, physically abusive & just all around a terrible women, she fucked up my dad to the point he tried to kill himself 7 different times before she died. She was abusive & terrible at times to me & my sister, but when she was sober I’d call her the best mom in the world. But that was rare.\n\nI say this to paint a picture of my childhood, my dad wasn’t completely innocent but that dude just wanted to rest after getting home from work, have a couple beers & watch storage wars or the UFC.\n\nI feel like I have some pretty bad trauma from witnessing how my parents loved eachother & it’s the only explanation I have for why I can’t seem to get out of my own way. I’m terrified of relationships because what if I fall in love with a women who’ll destroy me like my mom did to my dad? That question prevents me from connection because I’m a sensitive dude, I catch feelings easily & I’m already incredibly depressed & contemplating suicide. But the fucking complete abyss of my heart craves affection, I just want to be held, I just want a women to tell me she loves me.\n\nBut I’m incapable of doing anything about it because of that fear, so every night recently I tell myself what’s the point? Why try to get a better education? Why try to improve myself, why do I even consider that there’s someone out there for me? I tell myself that I’ll die alone & that no one will ever love me. I see couples on the street in love & doing all the things I’ve wished about since I was a kid, and my heart aches & I feel like a failure even though I’ve survived some pretty fucked up stuff. I’ve somehow kept a roof over my gutter trash head & I’ve made some progress in my life.\n\nBut the visceral fear I get when presented with an opportunity to connect with a woman & my immense desire to be loved keeps me in this spiral & it has for years. The loneliness keeps getting worse & the ache in my chest just keeps getting hollower, the only thing I want is the love of a woman. All this other stuff has always been secondary but therapy hasn’t helped. Maybe it’s the cess pit of a city I live in, the only women I see in my neighborhoods are basically alcoholics, drug addicts & the only women I’ve been genuinely interested in as an adult & felt like I could actually love & be vulnerable with were taken already.\n\nThis is my stupid struggle, thanks for reading & no need to comment or anything I came to vent because my thoughts were too loud.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pc0thq/having_trouble_finding_the_point/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pc0thq/having_trouble_finding_the_point/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I feel a lotta times, when we get a sudden sad feeling, we trap ourselves in that feeling and let it linger on through out our day, or week, maybe even the entire month. I don’t know everyone’s situation (heck, i sometimes don’t even know mines lolzies) and I’m not going to sit here and act like this is something easier said than done bc I know it isn’t. But sometimes we gotta FIGHT against those thoughts, and counter it with something that even so slightly gives us some kinda of happiness. At times, having those sad intrusive thoughts and it taking a toll on us just starts to get draining, that’s when you need to decide whether actions will be taken or you’ll let it eat you alive. For those constantly battling sadness, feeling like a burden, feeling hopeless, and sees not light at the end of the tunnel… it doesn’t have to always be that way. You can overcome this, you can come out on top and in a much better, and elevated headspace. You just gotta take a stand against those sad thoughts, and rebuttal against it with whatever you think gives you joy (if it’s the right kind of joy). An easier option to go about it is time in nature. There be times I be feeling down. And I’ll just get up and drive to Walmart and as I driving with the windows down and the cool fresh air blowing against my face, those negative thoughts just start slowly fading away. All naturally. Sometimes talking to yourself abt your personal issues and how you can be able to deal with them. Little things like that make a big difference, but when you actually give it a try, you’ll REALLY see how it helps. Life can just be an absolute beach, but let’s try not to sit on that resentment towards ourselves and our current situation, and strive to find and make a difference. We can do this! We can overcome this. We don’t need temporary friends or S/O to patch our wounds. We are our own weapon, we just need to utilize them to fight our hardships, and not utilize on ourselves.

It's up to you how you feel about them, but for what they actually are however well or not I've expressed them, I aim to stand by them. They become clearer towards the end.\n\n  \nYou, if you are alone at the moment, are not in a relationship worried about the sadly high chance you've met someone around at the moment that is a bad person, are being cheated on, are being betrayed etc, you're not being abused, used or manipulated by someone, being played / having someone be with you for nefarious or dishonest reasons, you're not in danger. You have no obligations you are scared or uncomfortable with; your life is yours and you are safe from people like that. Think about it, please. Just think about it for five minutes. \n\nMany reasons people get into relationships with others are ulterior in nature **and are not to do with the fact they actually love you**, whether that's many girls who do it to try to 'fix' someone, or for their money and resources ultimately, or to be socially accepted \\[for clout essentially\\] or guys who might do it just to take advantage of a way to not feel so lonely, and for sex, etc. Actually having the courage to stick to principles like only being with someone if you truly love them or feel for them is not something most people really have as crazy as this sounds. People live through societal lenses of value, & social currency, like animals.  People use people, in order to gain this currency and see stuff like this as something they feel pressured into doing or being not something they actually want, by \"the bank\", even if the want is shallow it's so \"abnormal\" to not want it they don't feel they can in any regard, so people just rush into stuff like this trying to fit in with everyone else. Because at least then they're not poor. I'm sorry to say this but especially girls too -- relationships are a status symbol to many girls, who pride themselves on luxury, wealth \\[in this analogy\\]. They say something about them, to other people - they indicate value, worth, etc, they play up their image and also make them feel \"complete\" in the sense of fitting in as a woman is supposed to - having a BF, a Husband, etc. Many guys want a girlfriend for this reason too - that \"ups their status as a man.\"  They all fear being single a very long time. They all fear being \"a loser\", but women generally believe it's kind of impossible for them to be one unless *EVERYTHING* they consider wealth goes to shit or suddenly loses value in the market, because they're a girl.  When that happens, you typically see girls getting very depressed. It's also why they're so indignant towards any commentary that threatens their perceived value or status.  \n  \nThe men on the other end of this shallow coin are fuckboys essentially who see themselves as climbing a ladder socially speaking and needing to acquire as much as they can and build up their ego. That's literally what they're trying to do - make it bigger. Girls and sex are a way to do that, make them feel more confident and powerful. So they'll enter a relationship with a girl looking for someone, treat her nice be kind and sweet and buy flowers but in their heads they're legitimately just manipulating her / doing what she likes or what girls like, they see it like a game. Yes, they'll even do it to those girls that cheat themselves, and play them like fools because the signals they give off, i.e confident, self assured, not trying too hard, but sweet, tell her brain he's a high value kind of dude and she shouldn't fuck around and should take him seriously. Meanwhile he's thinking \"too easy.\"  \n  \nThen once they have her secure and she's not going anywhere they've climbed up a peg. But from there it's about \"keeping her\" as if they've contained an animal, or a resource, not a person. So you get guys who see this as \"the game\" and they manipulate their way through girls finding \"easy pickings\" AKA girls who are really into them, get them, and then cheat on them because they're easy. They usually target girls who aren't \"way out of their league\" and will do and say anything to make that person **think and believe they actually love them** \\- in my experience, women shouldn't be so quick to react in horror because girls do this fucking shit too. They do it even more than men do. Which sadly some girls are so insecure about their value that stating anything negative however truthful about women makes them feel resentment, anger, condemnation, pity and rejection.   \n  \nMen do this because it makes them feel like the guy with the biggest ego / as though they have the most resources and they can afford it. So they enjoy being POS because it gives them a shallow form of power and well they keep on swimming and it's onto the next. They don't intend to find a girl and fall in love, they intend to \"lock down\" a \"hottie\", and keep her in place, while they do whatever they want. It's literally just about ego and power. Many of these guys fool girls into believing they're good guys as they've mastered the arts of manipulation and understand how women think, and just see it as using their own game against them. Some of them do this unconsciously actually, much of it is unconscious both sides.  \n  \nThat's why they often cheat as these relationships are built on a bunch of bullshit basically. They aren't real. Underneath it all if you dig really deep, there isn't even real attraction, just the fleeting sense and the rest of it was \"well, good enough.\" So that's all they have. \"Good enough\" - which is mental and doesn't last very long. And when that runs out they start to turn to someone else, breaking it off usually with the usual bullshit lines everyone's heard from both sides, lies, manipulating the story etc covering their tracks, \"I'm not ready for a relationship\" - next week they're on someone else's lap.\n\nIt's pathetic. It's just a giant ice rink of manipulators and more manipulators and more manipulators and all of them are giant liars bullshitting their way through everything. \n\nYou at the moment are not in this loop or caught in that system. You're not with anyone doing this to you. I understand it's painful, and lonely, and isn't right or fair, but for the time being, you have yourself and all the time to do whatever you want man. Think about it. You can do whatever you like because fuck it, why not - go where you want, go see what you want to see, do what you want to do. Anyone who has a problem is probably not someone you need to care or worry about anyway.\n\nIf you want to meet someone, a real person to be with who is not part of this whole thing and is someone on their own bandwidth you must actually acknowledge what the fuck is going on. OK? Here's how we do this:   \n  \nYou understand there's a problem. Stage 1. That's most of you .  \n2. You critically identify the key components of the problem, observe and learn. You accept when anything new you hear is just reinforcing what you already know.   \n3. You act on the problem.\n\n  \nRemove yourself from the ice rink. Your new mission is to find someone who is also not in the ice rink.  \nI figured this out at a very young age. That's simply the truth of your life; if you're not meant for it, stay the unholy \\*fuck\\* away from it. I made the dumbass mistake of trusting a Woman for the first time in over a decade the other year, and she was slap bang in the middle of it -a chameleon I thought was different. It destroyed me like a fucking CAT 5 hurricane. I was a dumbass. I cannot take back that it happened and if I could, I would in an instant. I wish I never met her. Don't be me.

I ended up doing pretty much everything I had no interest in for the sake of my mother and younger sister, prioritizing their financial well-being. I compromised on a lot of things, and everyone I was involved with seemed to want something from me but not me for who I am.\n\nThey left when things started getting really tough, especially financially. At that point, they chose what was best for them, and I do not blame them for leaving me at my worst. But it changed my perspective on love and marriage.\n\nThere was a time when even my own mother and sister — for whom I sacrificed all my passions and interests — saw me as someone to be discarded when I was briefly unemployed (just 2 months). I always gave them every extra penny I had, and it was never enough or never right.\n\nI live by myself now. The last time I visited my family was about 4 years ago. They do not miss me. They hardly try to contact me. The women I get involved with want more from me, just not *me*. I'm not saying everyone is like that, but unfortunately that has been my experience.\n\nI can't remember the last time I was happy. The days keep getting increasingly hard to navigate.  Anyway, I just thought I would share my mind here, considering that no one in my life seems interested in spending some time with me.\n\nThanks for your time.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pb4z24/hey/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pb4z24/hey/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

{"id": "1payu3i", "subreddit": "loneliness", "created_utc": 1764550469, "author": "HalloweenLoves", "title": "Why Online Bullying is Usually Much Worse than Real Life Bullying", "selftext": "Some older generations or those less savvy about technology may scratch their head at the idea of someone killing themselves over online harassment.\n\nThey might think to themselves \"Bullying is just a normal part of school and growing up, none of my peers were killing themselves over it?\" and they may even assume since it's online, it's even more silly that it could actually affect someone.\n\nI understand why some people think this way, but the reality is much more insidious...\n\n## Asymmetrical\n\nWhile bullying, in any form, is never a good thing, before the internet, it was at least a fairly self-contained phenomena, limited to your peers, and just one or a handful of bullies you had to deal with. In this context, it was actually something you could possibly fight back and overcome.\n\nOn the internet, it can become hundreds, or even thousands of people all targeting one person, more people than you've ever even met in real life, and that's not something you can manage and put a stop to. It's beyond unnatural in all of human history.\n\n## Location\n\nTraditional bullying was often something confined entirely to a single location, usually school. If you could just make it through the school day, you had the relief of going home, away from the bullying (some face abuse at home too, which is deeply tragic, but not what I'm talking about today).\n\nToday, there is no escape. The bullying follows you around in your pocket, 24/7. One might argue \"Then just don't look at it.\" Well, then you're isolating yourself from your peers entirely, and any existing friends and family you might be in contact with, that you don't see in person often.\n\n## Criminal\n\nIt usually crosses the line into criminality. While there's nothing illegal about calling someone a loser, I'm sure everyone would agree that breaking into someone's home, snooping through all their personal things, and sharing their diary publicly certainly would be.\n\nWell, the online version of that often takes place. It's usually just as much of a violation, it's just that some laws haven't yet caught up yet to know how to handle it.\n\nIn extreme cases of bullying where it's gone \"viral,\" you're no longer even dealing with peers, people in the same country, or even people you know. Some people join in for the sport of it, often adults harassing minors, which certainly is illegal.\n\nThe way most people live their lives now, you could do more to invade their privacy, ruin their reputation, get them fired, or even hurt or killed remotely than you ever could physically messing with them at their home, and obviously the former is much easier to get away with.\n\n## Vilifying\n\nThere's another kind of bullying that's rarely talked about, and that's when people feel justified in destroying someone's life over a social indiscretion, doing or saying something offensive, having a public meltdown, being generally disliked (a celebrity talking about politics), etc.\n\nIn real life, a 1:1 interaction with someone you find despicable and want to shame for bad behavior might even be appropriate, but in an online context, that can quickly become 1000000:1, which no longer has any justification and is wildly inappropriate and out of proportion for the original offense.\n\nThe problem is that most people who go online to shame bad behavior don't have the wherewithal to understand this accumulative pile-on effect. If you asked them does this person deserve to be told they're an asshole vs does this person deserve to die, they may have different answers. They may not. There's a certain apathy that takes place as well, when you're not confronted with the thing in real life.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis is where things get messy, and you begin stripping away freedoms when you introduce things like age verification laws in the name of child protection, when it's more about the agenda of spying on and controlling people than \"safety.\"\n\nSmarter laws that understand technology and how to punish the criminals without punishing everyone might be possible. Some would make the \"all or nothing\" argument. I think money would probably be better spent on issues of quality of life, education, and mental health, which is the true root cause.\n\nNo matter what though, schadenfreude and sadism is something that exists in humans, and certainly more so when we're younger. Luckily, most people do grow out of it. Some don't.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1payu3i/why_online_bullying_is_usually_much_worse_than/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1payu3i/why_online_bullying_is_usually_much_worse_than/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I just feel like I need to get this written down because it’s been weighing on me for years. \n\nIt feels like we're all floating in our own little bubbles, right next to each other, but unable to actually connect. I've been on all the \"make friends\" subreddits and forums for years now. It's always the same cycle. You write a post about yourself, put effort into it, and 24 hours later it's buried under 100 new posts. It's like a lottery. You just hope the right person happens to be online at the exact right time to see it before it vanishes. It’s exhausting.\n\nAnd the apps... It feels so superficial, like we are just shopping for people. It's all based on a few photos. We swipe left on people we might have become best friends with, just because we don't like their shirt. We reduce our entire existence to a few generic tags like \"movies,\" \"music,\" \"travel.\" It tells you nothing. We both like \"music\"? Great. You might love Taylor Swift and I might love 18th-century funeral marches. How does that actually help us connect?\n\nIt just makes me so frustrated because I know they're out there. People who are actually similar to us, who could become real friends. People who have the same specific interests, who have the same view on life. Statistically, in a city of millions, there have to be people who would resonate with you on a deep level. But they're invisible. We're all invisible to each other. We might walk past each other on the street every day without knowing how much we have in common. Or maybe the perfect friend for you is posting on this same subreddit right now, but you two just never see each other.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time deeply analyzing this because I’ve lived it. I realized that even with all these apps, finding your people is still mostly just luck.\n\nBut I think I finally figured out how to fix it. I realized I don't need to build a whole app right now. I can just build a working prototype without creating a massive platform.\n\nThe idea is simple. You just fill out a private form about who you really are. You list your hobbies, interests, how you like to spend your time, your goals, and your values.\n\nThen, the system connects you only when there is a real overlap. This could be shared interests, working on the same type of project, or maybe you are going through a similar life situation and can support each other.\n\nAnd crucially, the system explains to both of you exactly what you have in common. Instead of a blank chat window, you get an intro that says something like:\n\n\"You should talk to this person because you both love specific sci-fi books and you're both looking for a partner to practice Spanish with.\"\n\nIt cuts through the awkward small talk and gives you a real reason to connect instantly.\n\nI’m ready to pour my time into working on this project. Honestly, fixing this problem has become my obsession. It’s the only thing that gives me a real sense of purpose right now because I’m doing it for myself as much as for anyone else.\n\nBut I’m terrified that I’m wasting my time.\n\nI have zero budget, no team, and I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm just a guy sitting in his room hoping I’m not just solving a problem that only exists in my head. I'm worried that maybe I'm the only one who cares about this \"deep connection\" stuff and everyone else is fine with swiping.\n\nSo I just want to ask you guys a question and I really need an honest answer. If there was a tool that matched you with someone compatible based entirely on your personality - would you actually use it?\n\nDoes this resonate? Or am I just overthinking it?\n\n  \n*(I already posted a similar post before, but I've made some progress since then, so I decided to share an update and ask a slightly different question. I don't want to spam.*  \n*I really appreciate everyone who commented on my previous post - you gave me the motivation to keep working on this project.

I have been describe as a happy person, as I am genuinely happy and myself when i spend time with my love ones. Moreover, I naturally give a lot of love and care to those around me.\n\nHowever, naturally when people start adulting, they get busier and have less time. My BEST friends are back home and with the time difference and their hectic schedules, they don't have much time for me anymore, but try to help when they can.  \n In summary, I am also not very close to my family who are back home. They are lovely people, but we don't have the dynamic to share things with each other or text/call, even when I try to.  \n I feel like i've done everything i can, but it doesn't make a difference.  \n I join societies, talk to strangers, attend events, and go out. I stay active with my creative hobbies, sports, and exercise. I consistently reach out, and initiate plans. I even journal and reflect regularly to process my emotions and thoughts, and understand it is normal to feel lonely at times and how others experience it too.  \n Moreover, i do things and am okay being alone. I've eaten out and have gone on excursions/ activities by myself and do enjoy it.\n\nMy struggle is with feeling truly cared for and having someone consistently present in my day-to-day life. It might be tied to the fact that I'm single, but I often feel like I'm not anyone's priority. I give a lot of love and care to the people around me in different ways, but I can't force others to reciprocate that same level of care. This feeling is especially pronounced for me because most of the friends I have here are all in relationships, and I can't help but feel more isolated as a result.  \nI have shared how i feel to the people around me, but i have to acknowledge that you can't force a dynamic or feeling. My friends don't truly understand how I feel as they have their partners and so on. They respond lightly, such as, \" you can always call me\", \" \"you know that I would text you every few days to check up\", but it doesn't work out that way in practice.\n\nThis loneliness has resulted in me getting anxiety attacks, bad sleep and a lack of appetite. Moreover, my quality of work has gone down and I become very unproductive.    \n I have been to a few therapist sessions to see if there is any solution. However, they acknowledge that I have tried everything i could, and advise continue doing so. The best they could offer is for me is to talk to them if it helps alleviate any thoughts or feelings.\n\n  \nHowever, it's obvious that this can't continue forever! Any opinions and thoughts would be much appreciated. Thank You!!! :)\n\n(For reference:  \n \\- I can't move back home in the near future and don't necessarily want to  \n\\- I have tried dating, but no luck so far.

I always try to care about the people around me and give 100%, even if I don’t get the same in return. I’m a woman, and my friend group has always been entirely men. Because of that, I always felt like I was somehow on the side, that I would never be anyone’s number one. Sometimes, when that realization hit me, I had moments of crying into my pillow at night, but in the end, things were still okay.\nTo be clear — I have no idea why I don’t have female friends. In general, forming friendships is hard for me. I’m very shy, and I was usually just “adopted” by someone. All the girls I met already had their friend groups, and it was hard for me, the outsider, to get into them. But having a close female friendship has always been my unreachable dream.\nRecently, however, my friend group has been falling apart. Long story short, one of my friends accused me of something I didn’t do. I honestly don’t know what happened. He was drunk and seems to have gaslit himself into believing I said something I never said. He made a scene about it in the middle of the street, even though there were plenty of witnesses to our conversation, and EVERYONE can tell him he imagined the whole situation. The problem is that even after sobering up, he is convinced he’s right. He also started turning people who weren’t even there against me, and I can see they’ve begun acting cold towards me. The guy I considered my best friend (and who is also his best friend) hasn’t even reached out to talk to me about it. I feel strangely abandoned and I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for three weeks now. I texted this friend asking to meet and talk, but he hasn’t even opened my message. I’m trying to hold it together and not show that I’m struggling (I don’t like making my partner worry), but all I feel is growing panic.

I am M25, and currently living in another city in a sorta survivable sharing room as a paying guest. I have an almost existential loneliless inside me - like, it genuinely feels like the real me is an unknown seen by absolutely no one, not even my parents. And I know I have to do things to change that. And this is about one of those attempts.\n\nWhat happened was that there was a live sketching thing happening which I had thought I wouldn't be able to go, because it's on a Saturday and I work 6 days, but due to reasons this Saturday was off, so suddenly I could go. But the whole time I was weighing if I should, because on one hand it's the \"go outside and meet people\" thing, but also, there were some reasons I didn't want to go.\n\nI don't know anyone in this city - well, that's mostly true. By now I have created good rapport with the other 3 guys (it's a small team where I work) in my office, but other than that, the only people I \"know\" here are 2 guys who I went to college with, who are getting their Master's in this city, and a girl (let's call her Isha). I wasn't really that great friends with those two guys, meanwhile they're best friends, and since it's been some time I haven't really reached out to them.\n\nWhich brings us to Isha. This girl and I started chatting on Instagram in April this year, she was a junior in college who then shifted to a different one. I kinda knew who she was, but we had never spoken before. But suddenly we were talking a lot, and I was going through a rough patch, and she was approaching me herself, so that slowly became something positive in my life. Mind you, I had no delusions about it all - I hadn't met her, and I sure didn't have feelings for her. It was just nice to have someone to talk to regularly. But then slowly she started taking longer and longer responding; around June I moved to a city (different one) and one of my texts was left on delivered for a week before she responded about yet another of her Hinge date things. As much as I don't mind hearing about dates, it felt a bit disrespectful. We didn't talk for a while after that.\n\nLate September we began speaking again, and then I came to this city, same place where Isha lives, and I built up some courage to ask if we could hang out. And we did, and it was again a bit hopeful for me - this girl is pretty popular, one of those quasi-influencer types who gets posted on Instagram when she goes somewhere. I was like, I don't know anyone here, so someone to hang out with on Sundays was all I wanted (I work 6 days). Plus, maybe I could make some more friends through her, who knows.\n\nSo we hang out twice in total, and then holidays come and she tells me that she'd be going home, and then sends me a text that says: \"(Anon) i think I'm going awol for a while, I find you once I'm in that headspace\". That's it. I said okay. And then holidays ended, weeks passed, and I only asked once if we were still in AWOL, and she just said yes. So I didn't text her again.\n\nSo to bring it full circle, I kinda knew that Isha would be at this sketching place, and lo and behold, she was. And I kind of feel. . . relieved? Because I do NOT want to be around her again. Being actively ghosted twice has really soured my opinion towards her.\n\nBut question is - am I hurting myself? If I did go, it would be a bit awkward, but I'd have met people right? But it would have been difficult for me to enjoy it, I don't do well in social situations, especially when there's tension, and I don't even  know if the tension would be mutual or she'd just not even care. But like, I have mixed feelings. Sure, I can go to the next one, unless it's again on a Saturday, but it's just like, I dunno, I feel conflicted.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9s2nj/am_i_the_cause_of_my_own_issues/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9s2nj/am_i_the_cause_of_my_own_issues/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It’s very vulnerable to post my life story, I hope you can be so kind as to offer some help and support to assist me in finding my way out of this? It also may help other people who feel the same, feel better if you know you are not alone?\n\nGrowing up, I had two parents married and two sisters, we moved every three years or so because of my dad‘s job so no roots established anywhere - but it didn’t matter because I had my sisters so I didn’t have pressure to make friends, I was never lonely.\n\nI would consider my background to be working class. As a teenager looking back, I was sensitive but hide this behind trying to be one of the cool kids, really into football and pretending I wasn’t smart. My problems started at 16 when all my ‘cool kid’ friends left school. I knew I didn’t want to join the army like them so I stayed on and went to college. The problem was I’d spent all my time pretending not to be smart and marginalising the smart kids and now my friends all left and I was then completely  alone. It was a rough six months, eating my lunch in the toilet cubicle alone, desperately wanting people to reach out to me. Fortunately I did make friends however this only lasted just over a year then we all went our separate ways and I was one of the few who got into university.\n\nI really struggled to adapt to university. The people and their privately educated backgrounds were so alien to me. I felt like an outsider, I turned to an unhealthy lifestyle on the weekend to make friends. This led me down a very dark and depressing path during this time. I didn’t have a girlfriend for six years. Luckily I reached out for help, took antidepressants and slowly got better. I graduated and tried to find my place in the world of work. Looking back, I can see my attitude and choice of friends meant I made very poor friendship choices, none stuck around. Also my working class anxiety meant I had a complex that in turn alienated myself. How silly.\n\nI got very lucky and joined a Company at just the right time, the start-up vibe that offered opportunity and friendship in spades. Looking back that period in my 20s was the best part of my life. My dating life wasn’t as successful. I was very avoidant and I let some really great women slipthrough my fingers. I really regret this looking back. I was a very poor judge of character and I was a very difficult personality myself - what this meant was the friends I did make often had significant issues themselves because they were willing to be friends with someone like me and I was very selfish and I was very introverted and a lot of effort to be with. I never put any effort into my friendships instead I was completely relying on other people both friends and partners to consistently chase me because in my mind that meant they liked and loved me if they continually persisted when I gave so little back.\n\nI moved to London for work on my 33rd birthday with my partner however within three months my world came crashing down. She had been abroad for work and when she got home she abruptly told me she didn’t love me anymore and she was leaving. I was heartbroken - I didn’t see it coming. Within one week I was left alone with only a chair and a mattress in an empty two bedroom flat with a two year long lease freshly signed. Because it was so painful I could no longer maintain friendships with people who she was close to. This meant she kept all our mutual friends and I lost them all. I found the experience so traumatising, I couldn’t maintain friendships with people she was close to, and this ended the only friendships I had left. Another reason was that because of Covid we no longer went out drinking and clubbing and that was the glue that kept the friendships together. In hindsight, I miss those times so much, but on the other hand, I don’t miss drinking and being hung over.\n\nSlowly I healed and I met a new person and she is wonderful. The best person I’ve ever been with in my life, the one ray of light… but this is the thing I’ve realised - one person cannot be everything to you. This is a dangerous scenario. I’ve been in London for four years now and not made a single friend. I’m lonely, longing for the days when making friends was relatively (in hindsight) easy and I could laugh and joke and smile - it’s been so long since I could do this. The few people I do know have moved abroad or settled down to have children. It feels impossible to make friends. I’ve wondered about joining some kind of lonely men’s group or social activities but I feel there’s some kind of shame or stigma or sadness (in my mind) to having to do this - why I can’t just be like a normal person who maintains friends from childhood, school, university, and work? All of my friendships have died. I wish I could have made better choices in the past… but that ship has sailed.\n\nI’m now facing the scary possibility that if my partner leaves me, I would be completely alone and I feel my life is quickly passing me by and before I know it I’ll be an old man,  lonely with no children no family and no friends. My family live far from London and due to financial constraints and child care commitments they cannot see me. My parents raised us to be strongly independent, but I think it went too far.\n\nI’m now starting to feel my age, my last job was very stressful as it was the only thing that gave me a validation in my life and now I have some chronic indications of stress (like tinnitus, bruxism, nausea, fatigue etc). I had treatment for cancer as a child, but luckily this did not return. I spend a lot of time trying to find the cure to these symptoms.\n\nI’ve done two rounds of CBT in the past 12 months as I believe at the core of my loneliness is negative thought patterns, i’m very hard on myself and critical and judge myself and others very harshly. This means I don’t attract or keep people in my life. I’m also an envious person, I look across the tube carriage and see young, good looking sociable people enjoying themselves and I’ve just think to myself I wish I was them. I wish I wasn’t me. I feel like to make friends I need to be a completely different person and that feels scary and would take all my energy to achieve. Can I do it? Is it worth it? Do I have to be someone different to be happy? Surely I am the problem, or, is it something else?\n\nWhy do I have this deep seated need for other people to reach out to me, to make the effort to show me they want to be my friend? I’ve reflected and believe that I’m very bad with rejection and this inhibits me from being the person who puts in 90% of the effort to make a relationship work. My partner for instance probably has over 60 friends and she has no problem being the one who drives all those relationships. Maybe my problem is that I need someone to put the effort in but maybe you cannot ask this of anyone when you are me in my position at this stage in my life? Maybe I need hypnotherapy, can anyone recommend this?\n\nI would want more reciprocal relationships, roughly equal effort, being a shoulder to cry on, having a joke, a laugh, but also serious and interesting conversations. Someone to confined in, holidays together, there to help you move flat and I would give this all back in return.\n\nObjectively, other than some health issues, I have a good life, I have a lot to be thankful for, but having no friends makes everything else feel meaningless, and joyless. I worry if this low continues I will lose my partner. She deserves better. It also means without anything else, I pour what I have into work which then makes works inherently more stressful.\n\nI don’t know what to do to solve my loneliness, how do you make friends in your late 30s, in a city where you know no-one and you don’t have a hometown or any childhood friends to turn to? And so, I’m asking Reddit please can you offer me advice or please if anyone would like to make a friend reach out to me?\n\nTLDR - 37 year-old lonely male, with a partner, no children, and seeking loneliness advice and friendship in London, UK.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9pyuo/lonely_in_london_help/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9pyuo/lonely_in_london_help/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Despite having four siblings and a neighbourhood full of children, I was never one for groups or games. Now, give me a book, or a cat, or a frog, or a pond full of tadpoles, and I was your man. We had a huge garden that consisted of a lawn, followed by a large vegetable patch, and at the back, an orchard. That was my home. I sometimes lay sprawled out with a book under a huge Bramley apple tree. It was a spot often favoured by my cat, Cassius, but we had an understanding and didn’t much bother each other—just lay there together but separately under a warm summer sun.\n\nThere are two stories that I recall from this period, or should I say about this particular period of my life, which were separately recounted by my parents. Later in life, and often at dinner parties, my mother would recount how she came to check on the children, only to find a large group happily and noisily playing on the lawn—but with me nowhere to be seen. She always knew where to find me, yet when she tried to coax me to join the others, I would remonstrate that they were too noisy. She probably worried about me, and perhaps rightly so.\n\nNow, my father was a solitary man, not one much for company unless it was the company of strangers—a group that he could captivate, charm, and enthrall, yet leave at the drop of a hat, with no obligation. He had a few acquaintances in life, but outside of his work, he had no friends. I didn’t see much of him growing up because he divided his time between long days at work and weekends away on his own, as though he weren’t married. In fact, as a child, I often wondered if he really knew that I existed.\n\nBut once, when I was about eleven or twelve, he handed me a cutting from a newspaper in which the writer had written that the best days of his life were spent solitary as a child, lying in long grass. My dad said to me, “Isn’t that right?” A child of that age has far more of his wits about him than he is usually given credit for, and I was astounded. I assented that he was right, but after that interlude, I had a great respect for him because I sensed that we were men cut from the same cloth: pirates upon the wild seas, Cavaliers in flight from Cromwell’s Ironsides, or the lone ranger.\n\nIt was from these early lessons in solitude—both from my father and my own inclinations—that I carried myself into school and later university. I learned to navigate the world alone, to observe, to keep my own counsel, and to find companionship in books, animals, and the quiet corners of life.\n\nSchooldays at Grammar School were the happiest days of my life. I was popular enough, but I was never in the habit of forming attachments. University was a nightmare. In hindsight, I think I needed structure, and I was completely lost. I took to boozing, but always alone, and so continued a life of loneliness.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9i2he/my_own_brand_of_loneliness/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p9i2he/my_own_brand_of_loneliness/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

When youth is the best time to be alive!\n\nWell, psychologists point this issue to a combination of: a) Superficial social media engagement (Dr. Vivek Murthy: “You can’t scroll through a feed and know someone.”) b) Economic instability c) Hyperconnected but emotionally shallow digital spaces and, d) Individualistic cultural norms that weaken overall community structures\n\nBut the middle-age bracket isn't much far behind. U.S. adults in their mid-40s now show more loneliness than their counterparts in Europe or Israel; which can be traced back to a mix of career pressure, caregiving, debt, and limited social safety nets.\n\nThe more individualistic and overworked a society becomes, the more disconnected its people feel.\n\nI believe that loneliness has unfortunately become more of a public health crisis at this point, rather than a personal one.

I'm not like top peak alpha male but I'm pretty good looking and I believe I have a nice attitude. I go along with male and since I'm a regular there I'm pretty buddy with most of guys there. Daily peasy.\n\nI'm not especially looking for women. I mean really not. I really just go on my routine and live my best life. But there where events,\n\nThere was that one girl that came and started to come in a regular basis. After maybe a week she were there, I came to her and asking if I could be next on the machine she was using ( I ACTUALLY needed it). But being a nice guy doesn't mean never shoot your shot. I did a quick less than a minute talk, Hi my name is this, nice to meet you. You know, basics. And she responded very positively. She was smiling, showing up she was happy and comfortable. Day to day meetup.\n\nSince that day she never came back. Not a single day. She never ever came back.\n\nAt the same gym there was another one that I was not looking forward to. She was older than me and I really wasn't very attracted to her. She was on my Facebook friend recommendation for weeks. It was so pushed forward it even became a meme between me a a friend. She always was in my recommendation.\nSo I thought maybe she was stalking me on Facebook a little bit. Or even maybe she didn't and just Facebook understood we were going to the same gym. So after weeks of seeing her on Facebook (without ever looking for her profile), I finally clicked the add friend button. \n\nWitting the same hour, she blocked me and believe it or not, never ever came back to the gym again. Not a single day despite she was a regular there. \n\nI don't even consider these two examples hitting my shot. It was just plain contact. \n\nProbably coincidences, but still I feel like I'm a serial killer or something. But I'm just a guy.\n\nWay before this I remember a girl in the bus, in which I actually tried something: I asked her if she knew at what time the bus drove this line last. I really needed the info but at the same time I found it was probably a good idea to get to meet someone (because hey, you don't get to live your whole life alone either).\n\nI asked nicely, I smiled, and I ever keep safe distance for her to feel comfortable. I'm telling you: I'm just a normal civilized guy. \n\nShe didn't answer. She just looks straightforward not answering anything. Just like when you're trying to avoid a homeless guy asking you for money or drugs or something. She gave me the look of someone feeling threatened.\n\nI'm a healthcare worker, I shower everyday and do basic grooming. I dont look like anything else than the guy next door.\n\nI swear I don't exaggerate anything.

For the first time in years I wake up and actually want to be here. I’ve got energy again, ideas again, hope again.\n\nSo I poured everything into a new startup I’ve been quietly building. It’s the first thing that’s felt truly meaningful in forever. Beta is launching in the next 2–3 months and I’m stupidly excited about it… but also kind of isolated.

I’d genuinely be so grateful to connect with even one or two people again. I respond to everyone.\n\nThanks for reading this far.

Throughout school I was definitely socially awkward but could mask it and fit in with the people around me. However, I always found myself being the third wheel in a duo, or the fourth outsider in a trio throughout grade school. \n   College was great as I was able to be authentically myself and meet people, but then Covid happened and took away 3 semesters as I had to move home (while all my home friends were still able to live on their campuses). Junior year I joined greek life and I was able to have a blast and good friendships into my senior year. \n   I then attended grad school at an ivy—one of the worst mistakes for my mental health. Was in a small cohort of the same people who were all determined to act better than others, create rumors about each other, and create a negative, anxiety-provoking environment that made 23 years of feeling certain of who I am as a person suddenly crumble. Basically, what typically happens in grade school to people happened to me in grad school (ironically some people only get worse when they get older it seems). This competitive nature made it very hard to make friends in this program, and it was so small that I only had the same exact classes with this cohort, I couldn't meet anyone else outside of it really and extracurriculars weren't prioritized either. \n   Fast forward to now, I'm 25 and just started my first ever full time job, and it's not what I'm interested in but in this job market I can't really complain. I'm the only Gen Z person at this office and keep to myself because not many people include me in conversations. I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years now and have moved in together (in a separate floor of his parent's house), and I'm so extremely grateful for him and all of his support, but I feel like I just work, come home, spend my free time with him and his family, and I don’t have anything going for myself outside of this. I'm on apps to find friends and I try to go to events in my nearby city, but I just feel very alone and like I'm not living my 20's to its fullest potential, but I don’t even know how to do so when I feel like I try with the people I already know and they don’t give me the same effort back. I may just be prioritizing socializing too much in my life, but it's always what I've craved from my upbringing so it's hard to not have that. \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p3xhb7/going_through_a_quarter_life_crisis/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1p3xhb7/going_through_a_quarter_life_crisis/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

There's a reason that 27 is such a common age for people to die. Our brains aren't fully formed yet, still forming, or only recently formed, all while the safety nets are stripped away.\n\nNo more free hand-outs. You've got to figure out how to survive all on your own. Find a job, somewhere to live, keep your bills paid, and feed yourself. Some people struggle with this for the rest of their lives.\n\nI would argue that most of us take ourselves way more seriously in our 20s than even our teen years, because the constant question of your worth comes up. A brutal time of insecurity where matters of physical attractiveness are concerned.\n\nNo shame in having fun, but the alcohol consumption of this decade surely plays a factor as well.\n\n**30s: Acceptance**  \nThe beauty of making it to your 30s usually comes in the form of \"therapy.\" Not necessarily going to an actual therapist, but just living long enough to hopefully have figured out a few healthy coping mechanisms, and the ability to have perspective.\n\n**40s: Relaxation**  \nI feel like our 40s is the real sweet spot. After surviving the confusion of childhood, the embarrassment of being a teen, the brutal existential crisis that is your 20s, the hard work of finding peace in your 30s, hopefully most people are prepped enough by their 40s to simply enjoy life again.\n\n**50s+: Retirement**  \nSome of us will work until the day we die, some of us will retire, and the luckiest of us will find something they enjoy doing, that also happens to pay the bills.\n\n**NONE OF THIS APPLIES TO ME**  \nIf you've had nothing, but a brutal existence, and there's no \"just making it to the next phase of life,\" I truly understand and I'm sorry.\n\nSome people were simply dealt a bad hand in life and there's no mind-over-mattering their way out. But, the vast majority of humans have the ability to make their lives better as they move along, by simply sticking around long enough.\n\nPS: While 100 years may seem like a long time, it's barely enough time to start to understand ourselves and the world.

I've dated a whole whirlwind of lovers, and had many friends, and joined various groups online and offline, and had to be around people due to college and workplaces. But I have always felt a profound disappointment in these interactions sooner or later. No matter how deeply I love someone, we don't really understand each other and instead choose to see fantasy versions of each other or to wish one another were different. I've spoken my whole life story to multiple people, and they...don't get it. Most are sympathetic, but nobody ever makes me feel seen and like I have somebody permanently by my side. And in all the many people whose life stories I have heard, I have cared deeply for many of them and loved and will always love them, but I feel a certainty that I am not able to be what they need or really fill the voids in their lives or really understand the specificity of their experience. We remain selfish in the craving for attention and for the fulfillment of our own idealized fantasies even when we do enjoy spending time together. We just don't get each other. It's not possible for people to get each other, to feel each other's emotions truly.  \n  \nI know that my life has been strange and that my trauma alienates me from many people, but I don't think that's the problem, because as I said, many people do hear me out and care. I just don't think it would be possible to really connect deeply enough with others without a mind meld of some sort, which, if it were even possible, would just merge you into one larger being who would once again be alone. Besides, we will all die and be apart from one another anyway. I don't believe in an afterlife, which means that our only time to be together is here and now, and we are too limited as beings to really do that effectively. We just stumble over each other and disrespect each other and disappoint each other. I have lost interest in making friends or being with other living people more and more as this idea has taken root in my mind. It seems that I will only hurt people and let them down by being around them. I talk to people superficially and in a friendly way that makes most people like me, and I try to be generally a good community member, but I am giving up on the idea that I will have deep connections with others. Better to continue just being of help where I can without actually trying to get to know the people I'm associating with (baking for school functions, tidying up, volunteering, chatting with people who need company, etc., but not actually talking to anyone on a deeper level). Better to focus on making art and maybe writing down my life's history so that it will at least exist on paper after I die, even if it will never be understood by others.

I got married in December 2023, but the relationship collapsed within a month. My former wife soon filed several false accusations against me, and though the divorce was finalized this July, the whole process has left me financially, mentally, and physically shattered.\n\nPaying for legal help and the Alimony settlement that I paid to my ex-wife, for a marriage that lasted not more then 17 days,  wiped out every bit of my savings, investments, and PF. I’m now in serious debt that will take nearly a decade to repay—almost half my current take-home salary goes into it. Most of the friends I thought I could rely on disappeared during this time. I guess my financial and emotional struggles made them distance themselves.\n\nEven though the legal stress is over, the emotional scars remain. My phone is silent unless it’s work related. I made the mistake of opening up to some colleagues early on, and a few of them now mock my failed marriage—sometimes even using my ex-wife’s name just to tease me. I’ve tried to tell them to stop, but they don’t listen. I keep quiet because I can’t risk losing my job.\n\nWhat hurts the most is the loneliness. There’s no one in my life who asks how I’m doing or how my day was. I live with my parents and have an elder brother, but we’ve never been emotionally close as a family. We don’t talk about our feelings. I feel like I’m becoming numb—questioning the point of my job and life in general.\n\nI’ve attempted meditation, exercise, prayer, and other ways to heal, but I can’t stick to anything. I end up doom-scrolling for hours. Despite having 500+ contacts in my phone, there isn’t a single person I feel I can call to just break down and talk. No messages, no check-ins, nothing.\n\nThe loneliness is becoming unbearable.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1oyqqfz/struggling_after_divorce/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1oyqqfz/struggling_after_divorce/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I was bullied when younger, and experienced abuse throughout my life.\n\nBecause I was bullied, and was let down by friends who treated me like competition, I rarely let anyone in.\n\nI was depressed for 14 full years, and near the end of those 14 years I was crying myself to sleep every night and had suicidal ideation.\n\nI numbed myself with food, not even enjoying it. But food only distracted for as long as I was chewing. Then I would have to look for another alternative.\n\nGames distracted me for as long as I was awake, but at night I was still alone and my problems weren’t gone. Thoughts of death and self hatred haunted me. I ruminated on them on my tear soaked pillow.\n\nMy days comprised of sleeping from sheer exhaustion, to waking up to a “dreadful” day, to gorging to numb myself, work and pretended I was happy and “normal”, return home and repeat. I felt like a zombie.\n\n*What was the meaning of life?*\n\nIn October of 2016, a demon was pressuring me to end my life. I assumed it was my voice because I was agnostic atheist. She was speaking especially harshly that night because I was hanging on a thin thread.\n\nWhen I had decided to end my life, something was encouraging me to pray to the “God of the universe.”\n\nI gripped my hands, nails dug into my skin so I could distract myself from the emotional turmoil, and looked up to the ceiling.\n\nI asked the “God of the universe” to please remove the pain. Anything to remove the pain.\n\nI heard a strong wind hit my window and a presence shot into my back with a force so strong my torso leaned forward from the impact.\n\n*What was that!?*\n\nI felt something move inside my heart, like plucking on my heartstrings. The something was settling in my heart, as if making himself comfortable.\n\n*’What a waste of life.’* I heard.\n\nWhat was that? I looked around me.\n\n*’What a waste of life.’* He repeated again and again.\n\n‘This being is mourning for me before I even die?’ I thought, confused.\n\n*’One more try.’*\n\nThe female voice that was telling me how much I sucked and to die, was being drowned out by this calm voice that gave me hope and feeling of peace.\n\nIt was the Holy Spirit of God who saved me. I would’ve been dead in 2016. I would’ve ended in hell and tormented there forever.\n\nFood didn’t fill the void of loneliness. Games didnt fill the void of loneliness. Nothing of this world filled the void.\n\nBut I’ve found what does: Jesus, Father, and Holy Spirit fills my void.\n\nAt times when I feel lonely, I just spend time worshipping our Lord and the Holy Spirit gives me joy.\n\nWe are battling more than flesh. This war is spiritual.\n\nIf you’ve tried everything to fill you, and it hasn’t worked, how about you try Jesus? :)\n\nGod bless you. May you have a radical encounter with Jesus, in Jesus’ name.

I'm at a point where I basically just go to work, go home. Watch tv. Apply for jobs. do it all over again. I barely talk to anyone. When I'm in a depressive episode, I generally drop almost everyone. It feels like I'm a raw nerve, my whole being and psyche, and too much people is too much. I save the majority of me for work, because obviously. Then when I come out, I only go back to a few. As I've gotten older, it just seems like fewer and fewer. I think this time, I just don't want to do it again. Not open myself to anyone new. I'm such a mess anyway, and so much older at this point than all my other retries, why not just leave it to being just me? No more vulnerabilities. No more trying to rebuild relationships. Or grow any relationships that I'm just gonna fuck up anyway. Or start again. Especially since I'm just counting down the years until I can die from a natural death (as soon as possible)....why not just keep to myself? Am I lonely? YES! But not in any way that can be fixed. I think, when you're a certain type of person, when you go so little for so long, from childhood, you need more than anyone can give you. It's like sleep deprivation. You cannot actually make it up. So people like me, whose needs keep us fucking up relationships, we fuick up our relationships b/c we ask for more than others can give. And no, I don't think it's a therapy thing or work on ourselves thing. At some point, even if we regulate well, we have to accept that. It's not like we're a black hole of need, but relatively speaking it can come across that way. So I just want to stop being alone in a crowd. Loving people more than they love me. Prioritizing people more than they prioritize me. I don't know, and even after trying haven't been able to reach a happy medium, on how to have balance. How to be satisfied with scraps. So I just want to stop. I've gone through this phase before, and I do get back into trying again. But now for real, my life sucks so hard right now that I just want to be accepting of not trying at all. Just me and my never ending job searching and part time jobs and panicking over money and not taking medicine I need and using books and tv to calm down. I am saying in the universe - I give up the extreme positive emotions of happiness and joy if it means I can stay away from the extremem negative emotions. I want numbness. That's it. I want to exist and I want to only exist. And I want to only want to exist.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1oum8dg/contentment_with_how_i_always_end_up/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1oum8dg/contentment_with_how_i_always_end_up/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Life often feels empty and lonely. I see others sharing moments of happiness... spending time with loved ones, enjoying life’s simple pleasures... while I find myself disconnected and searching for meaning. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone truly sees me or cares. I've shared my struggles before, and honestly, life has sometimes felt like a series of hardships, teaching me lessons of pain rather than joy. The weight of loneliness and depression is heavy....like a shadow that never quite leaves me. I try to escape the darkness, even if just for a moment, but it never fully leaves me.\n\nRight now, I’m in a quiet forest, alone with my thoughts, writing this out of a deep sense of solitude. Life was brighter during school and college, when everything seemed full of possibility. But as I grew older, I chased success and money, only to find myself a slave to them... losing touch with happiness and genuine connection. I left behind a promising career at a big tech company to pursue my own venture, which grew but at a personal cost. The pursuit of success stole something precious from me: my joy. And despite all the achievements, I still feel empty inside....like I’ve lost the essence of who I am.\n\nLife feels fleeting, a brief chapter in the grand scheme. We spend so much of it working, earning, surviving... rules seemingly set to keep us busy but disconnected from what truly matters. Despite having stability, I still feel the ache of loneliness, of being unseen and unheard. Sometimes I visit cemeteries, reading the names, contemplating the brevity of life... some left too soon, others lived fully. I wonder about those lives, about the chances I never took to truly connect or understand. It’s painful to think how fleeting it all is, how quickly it’s gone.\n\nIn complete isolation, I share this here, hoping to find a little relief.

Too often people will express themselves as “broken,” but I fail to see how a human being can be such. At any given moment we are the fullest of ourselves that we can be. At any given moment one could perish, and no longer walk on this planet, causing their “life cut too short” to seem like they were not full already. Think of someone like Jimi Hendrix, who died at 27, but what he did while he was alive was incredible. Sure, we wouldn’t want individuals to die young like that, but we needn’t look at it as a missed opportunity. His place on this earth was just that long, and had he been here longer he would have been out of place and out of time. Thus, we should live every day as if it were the last. Not in the sappy manner that some will admire of “What if you died tomorrow? Be kind,” but in the sense of “I am who I am today, and I should continue to grow.” \n\nI cannot be broken, as I am the fullest version of myself that I can be at this time. Whenever I think to myself “I’m broken,” perhaps I mean that I am too full, too enriched with knowledge and understanding that suddenly I cannot take anymore. Suddenly I stare out into the world and I no longer see the wonder of life but a version of it that causes me to think “How can I make this place better to live in?” rather than “Let’s explore unto the horizon.” Sometimes, that causes a mental collapse within me, but not a brokenness; it is a complex situation where I have walked on the solid path but found how long the path was and stopped in my tracks. I shall continue to walk the path, but doing it alone is difficult. I find that day in and day out, in every aspect of my life, I am entirely alone. Yes, there are people near me and around me. I go to work and see my students and co-workers. But all in all, there is a loneliness within the crowd that debilitates the soul. This loneliness is, as Frank Sinatra understood it, is a sadness and isolation that only the lonely know. \n\nThat is why it is so vital to “know thyself”; always in a constant dance with the soul and world, attempting to create beauty out of what seems like scattered dreams of the mind. But one mustn’t fear the inevitable outcome of death. There is never a moment where I am not living, and as the old adage goes, “I’m too busy living to be too busy dying.” Thus, my life is full within myself, but without, I am alone. Yet, there is hope that I may meet a bird on the path and make a friend. \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1osibav/i_am_not_broken/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1osibav/i_am_not_broken/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Im a recently turned 18m. In a sort of recent turn of events (may this year) I lost all my friends. I grew up in a cult-like church my whole life, developing friendships with my buddies in there. As I got older and started to think about how I didn't align with this cults beliefs and realized how controlling and evil it was, I decided to leave (may 2025). Following this, I was kicked out of the house and cut off by my parents and family. And all of my friends cut me off. Everything and everyone I have known for the last 18 years, gone. I had two friends from work that I am now living with, and their family has been incredibly supportive to me, and they treat me like im family. I just feel lonely still. I have these people around me now, which don't get me wrong I love and I am eternally grateful for. However, I miss my friends. I used to be so close with a few of my friends and now our circle is gone, I can no longer talk to my best friends. I feel so lonely, because sometimes I just want to hang out with people other than my new \"adopted family\" not that I don't love them or love spending time with them, but my relationship with them is more of a family type than like a deep friendship type if you know what I mean? I also had a girlfriend who was my best friend who I also lost around the same time (parents/church didn't approve and made me cut her off in February, leading to her moving on and finding someone new by the time I was able to get out of that church). It felt like everything crashed at once and I still feel so lonely. I have trouble making new friends. I am a senior in HS and due to the circumstances my former church had me in, I was very socially limited and never made good friends at school. I have a group who I kinda hang around at school but im the outsider friend. I never get invited to things, am not in the group chat, just kind of am there at lunch. They're honestly more of accuaintences than friends. This is fine, as tbh these people aren't exactly who I could see myself being friends with, nothing terrible just not really people who share any interests with me. Anyways, I don't know how to make friends. I think in my social interactions I am constantly looking for something to feel like how it did with my best friend that I am no longer in contact with. Something with how our relationship was just honestly was so fulfilling socially. We were always there for each other, fit each others personality perfectly, shared like the exact same interests always working on cars together, fishing, snowboarding, basketball, etc. But I just feel like I don't know how to connect with people on that deeper level like I had with him. I think for him it happened naturally because we were kind of forced to be in proximity together for so long that we ended up as best friends. But I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to make friends. Im not in a good mental state. My grades are slipping, so is my attendance. Financially I am struggling right now as I wasn't prepared for a sudden change in housing, employment(I had worked with my dad prior), car insurance, health insurance, almost everything financially is different and more expensive now as I have to afford these things on my own. I just want help. And I want friends that were as supportive as my old ones. A good circle just like my old one. But I don't know how to get there. I feel like everyone has their own friend groups and best friends and I feel like I will always be the floater friend.\n\n  \nTLDR: Lost my friends and family due to a conflict in religion.

This keeps happening in every \"friend\" group I'm a part of. At first I think I matter, only to eventually have it be made clear to me that I really don't. They don't dislike me, they just don't care all that much. I think it wouldn't be so hard if I didn't keep thinking I mattered more than l actually did. I'm in my early 30s and this has been happening for as long as I can remember. Over and over and over. \n\nAfter this last time I'm accepting it now, but I've been crying a lot because it's a hard thing to realize and start to accept and I feel stupid for not seeing the obvious signs, and pathetic that this keeps happening yet I keep desparately trying. But it won't happen anymore, I'm done hoping/believing \"things will be different this time.\" I don't know what it is about me that keeps me on the fringes or outside of every social circle. It's not even the amount of time I've been a part of a certain circle, because people who join later become clearly more a part of the group than I am. \n\nGrowing up I was always replaced or pushed out of every friendship/friend group I was part of. I thought as I grew up things had changed and I was important to some people, and I feel incredibly stupid for thinking that. Things haven't changed all that much. It hurts to finally see that. 30+ years I've been hoping and trying and believing, but I have to stop otherwise I'll only keep hurting myself this way. \n\nI've been celibate for nearly two and a half years, and before that I was never in a relationship, only casual. I was planning to make it three years then try to find an actual relationship which I've never tried before. I was looking forward to giving it a shot and meeting someone. But now there's no way I'm doing that. I can't even get friends that care about me, I'm not going to find an SO that does even if it seems that way at first. So next summer once the 3 years are up I'll be keeping things strictly casual. \n\nI feel incredibly lonely. I don't belong anywhere and never will. The sooner I really accept that, the sooner I can finish grieving and move on. I don't have anyone to talk to, so I guess I'm just posting this here to vent and get it off my chest.

Basically I'm 23 y/o, I have no friends, I've never had a girlfriend and I only lost my virginity a few weeks ago because I visited a prostitute. Funny enough, because she didn't kiss me, and I've never kissed a girl before, I managed to loose my virginity before ever kissing a girl. My entire life I've been a very awkard guy. My very first memories in life are of being awkard, like other kids coming up to me asking me to play with them and telling them no, stuff like that. Over time it only got worse, as kids my age started to develop and I remained very childish and socially stupid. During puberty I got really fat, had the most acne I've ever seen on anyone in real life and developed really bad gynecomastia (to the point that I had to get surgery at 19, and even now I'm thinking of getting another one because I still have a lot of breast gland tissue). For the last five years I've slowly lost my last remaining friends from school. I was never a guy who cared much about girls, which makes me believe my libido must be pretty low, and therefore also my testosterone levels (the gynecomastia also points in that direction, apart from other factors like low sperm count or no morning boner). However, for the last year or so I have started caring about girls, to the point where now it's the only thing I care about. It's almost like I'm going through adolescence in my twenties. I've started going to the gym, apart from playing rugby, and I've gone down from 120kg (265lbs) to 100kg (220lbs). I'm still very fat for a guy my height (176cm), but it's progress I guess. I would like to get down to 85kg\\~, but even if I do, my personality will still be shit. I feel like a kid in a world of adults, since everyone my age is so much more developed than me socially and emotionally. In fact, the only reason why I'm posting here is because the girl I met through her post rejected me on account of being too childish for her, so even the loneliest of the lonely is too good for me. I've tried dating apps but that hasn't worked, obviously, considering that the girls there expect a normal functional adult, which is not exactly what I bring to the table. In fact I got scammed and now some filipino lady has a video of me naked jerking off on camera and is asking for 1500€, so I hope that doesn't reach my family and acquaintances. I told her I was going to kill myself and stopped responding, so hopefully that works. Having said all this, if any girls my age want to talk I would love that.

Eventually I’d like to be friends with more girls, but it’s hard to just feel trusting with them anymore right now. Also I have issues getting alone with people my age in general. I just can never relate, almost every time I meet someone my age I’m just never the right genre. I’m a furry, a home body, I have no job or drivers license, I’m not in school and live in a very rural area. I live with and depend on my father for everything. The only people I get alone with are older men. I’m talking 28+, and I’ve got three friends I talk to, but obviously; they get busy, or are in different time zones. I tried making a post to make new friends, and the only guy who actually messaged me, called me his “baby” within 48 hours. Told me he wanted me to move in. Why? Why is it so hard to find a guy friend who’s older, and just actually have them as a friend? I’m sure it’s because I have a shit relationship with my older brother and my father, I’m not looking for a sugar daddy or anything like that. It’s just for some reason older men make me calm. I feel so fucking weird for that too like, I feel immediately sexualized for it. I don’t know, I’m not expecting anyone to actually read this,  but I really would like older guy friends. I’m tired of playing games solo. I’m tired of being in the house because I can’t go anywhere. I’m just tired of being isolated.
