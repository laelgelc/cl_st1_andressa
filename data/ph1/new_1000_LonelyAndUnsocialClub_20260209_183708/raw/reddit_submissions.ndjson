It's not like what my sadness usually feels like. \n\nI feel overwhelmingly sad and miserable and lonely. I look in the mirror and I barely recognize myself. I recognize my face, it's different but I recognize it, I feel like an outsider looking in. \n\nI've always had a romanticized view of life and love, and I think it's starting to hurt me. I don't know how to have this conversation with anyone. Not even myself. I don't know how to explain it. \n\nIt's like the romance novels and movies I watched growing up made me think life was a certain way, and that all people loved the same, but I know that's not true and it's still hard to comprehend.\n\nI feel depressed and anxious and burned out, but it's more intense than normal. I feel withdrawn and empty inside and like my brain constantly wants to make me think stressful things. I haven't slept through the night in ages and I have no motivation for studying. I'm lonely and craving attention but I dread having to leave the safety and comfort of my room and home.\n\nI'm on the edge of tears all the time. I'm going therapy this week for the first time in a long time but I don't know what to talk about first or even at all. I'm terrible at staying on topic and telling things in a straight line, especially when I'm not sure how to talk about things I don't understand.\n\nI have a wonderful boyfriend who means the world to me, but we're long distance and its really hard to bring topics like this up, because I want to make sure the time we do have together and times we get to talk are not sad or stressful.\n\nI don't really have any friends, and while I would love to make some, I don't know how. I'm very shy and introverted and I don't want to make friends just to bring them down, y'know?\n\nAll I want is my boyfriend, but he is a math grad student and he's preparing for a very big, important, and stressful exam he needs to get for his PHD. I think I need more friends so I stop aching for his company all the time.\n\nAny advice or thoughts on any of the above?", "score": 19, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonelyAndUnsocialClub/comments/t3ytpc/im_very_lost/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonelyAndUnsocialClub/comments/t3ytpc/im_very_lost/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I am not allowed either. My parents are really scared of people. And they think that all teens do, is to do dumb shit that can put me in danger.\n\nIts so heartbreaking to scroll on snapchat on a Saturday night, seeing that EVERYONE is with their friends or partying, and I am just sitting alone in my room.

I just want to be heard and rant because I have nowhere else to. (If I did this post wouldn’t exist lol)\n\nIf you’re un interested that’s fine as well🤟 I bet most people will be \n\n\nWhen I was in elementary I had friends, but I didn’t. I was introverted so I never hungout with people unless it was at school. I did befriend my neighbour but we grew apart.  From grade 1-5 I was always the outcast, something I never outgrew lol\n\n\n All of that resulted in me having a weird af personality going into middle school. I didn’t really know how to act in front of people like at all. So I was often hated and cast aside. I did make friends here or there but for some reason the friendships always ALWAYS went up in flames and never recovered\n\nDuring highschool I started to get friends and I actually was popular for a year and had a huge friend group, but even they were all toxic and fighting all the time. Then grade 11 rolled by and when a girl I was seeing cut things (cause I didn’t drive yet). all of my “friends” went with her and I was a lonely mess the rest of the year. Like I said, up in flames\n\nThat same year my birthday rolled around, and my best friend (we’ll get to him) went hiking with friends instead of spending it with me like he promised and didn’t even apologize for missing my birthday or try to do something with me afterwards just left the topic there. One of my ex buddies texted me so I chilled with him instead. then he brought all of his friends and I was once again alone in a room full of people. Honestly feels better to actually be alone on your birthday than alone surrounded by 10 others\n\nsenior year came I didn’t hangout with anyone and often went lunches being alone.\nI’d try to make friends but people would turn awkward, walk away, or just straight up ignore me. It hurts to say hi and be ignored for a minute and have to walk of shame away😬after a while, I often chilled alone in empty hallways at lunch just so I didn’t have to be constantly reminded that most highschoolers have great friend cliques\n\nFast forward to my first year out of primary. I get a job and think that I can maybe make friends there. Nope everyone’s just as awkward and ignores me no matter how hard I try to be friendly and initiate convo. (I get I’m awkward but cmon)\n\nObviously I get along with some there but I can’t say they’re my “real friends” and even they do it sometimes so I started keeping to myself and even that weirds everyone out because “I’m too quiet” so it’s just a lose lose all around.\n\nEven my parents give me the awkward treatment a lot which sucks because they know I have a condition that doesn’t help my social skills\n\nI do have a best friend, he’s been with me for 8 years. I value him and would do anything however I always felt like he never thought the same of me, going back to the hiking story as well. He always did things exclusively for himself and still does. He’d even make me walk 20 minutes home in blizzarding -35 Canada temperatures in a very thin hoodie because he didn’t feel like driving me on multiple occasions. We’ve since been distant because he doesn’t really like texting me or doing anything so that leaves me with _______.\n\nI have a minor disorder which affects my friend making skills as well so that has a huge factor, and I don’t think the years and years of on and off toxic friendships helped anything either. It doesn’t bother me all the time. However sometimes it keeps me up at night knowing I have nobody to talk to and all those memories haunt me\n\nI’ve never had a real friend who wants to see me succeed or actively tries to hangout with me none of that. I know I’m young but the thought of having no friends all of my life scares me...\n\nIf you made it here I thank you for taking the time to read!

A Jedi is the keeper of peace and history, we use words, ideas, and knowledge, and are led to these things by the force.

Religion never worked for me, and then it hit me, and all the knowledge from my childhood fantasies, synced up with what I know about real religions, and real spirituality, if these concepts and labels, help me understand something that is both improving my life, and also, enables me to find a true faith that I never knew I could have, how is this wrong or crazy? I guess, you have to be out on a ledge, for a really long time, before you start becoming grateful for the things that make you realize, what the fuck am I doing on a Ledge, I got an Xbox and Playstation, I got skills and talents, life is not so bad, why am I not finding a way to be happy? The Darkside does not want us to be happy, and it makes us lazy, it lies to us, distorts the truth, and makes us hate ourselves, it makes us long for release from suffering, when we can end our own suffering through the choice to find happiness.

Maybe a little more around American people as compared but then I shouldn’t feel like I don’t belong around Indians.\n\nI stay in my little cocoon. I read I write, I watch movies.

Talking to myself is helpful in unraveling my thoughts. I feel like a loser. I feel lost. It’s not that I don’t have the potential to do things. I have great potential but it’s just that I am chasing way too many rabbits at the same time or maybe I am just thinking about chasing them but in reality, I am not pursuing even one.\n\nI seek advice but then I don’t value advice so much. How can someone help me guide my path? I know myself better than anyone else. But do I really know myself as well as I think I do? I feel like a bullshitter.

Been it all, and I’m back again. So theology told me\nThat the gift of prophecy was removed from the world. And also as a Christian, I have to stay away from people claiming to know the future. One last thing. I’m fully jaded now so I live life like a leaf in the wind and just hope for the best, and expect the worse. With that being said. I’m open to all interpretation of this story that has plagued me for a total of ten years now.\n\nDisclaimer: I also feel strongly about putting things into the universe. So I kind of don’t want to hear the self fulfilling prophecy thing, since it’s not really going to change my life, as I’m hoping a stranger on reddit will.\n\nIn 2010, I was 18,f, dating a boy from Queens,NY. I was from uptown NYC, New Yorker non the less, so I knew how to get around the boroughs pretty well. It was winter, and I had on ugg boots and sweat pants or something. And I had just gotten off the 7 train in corona queens. This area is not as grid like as Manhattan, and it sprawls out into suburbs. But I had that area recorded like the back of my hand. \n\nThat night I got lost for a total of 2 hours, on what was suppose to be a 10 minute was. I kept turning corners and seeing empty streets that seemed vaguely familiar. To shorten this thread I’ll tell you what happened. Enough details. \n\nThis man kept appearing everywhere I turned. And I was going far. I would hesitate and pick another direction, following my internal gps. And finally he stops me. He tells me “the mans house you are going to is not your husband. In this life, no man will ever satisfy you. God told me to tell you, you have a higher calling. That I should forget about man.” And it stopped my whole world. In about 10 minutes as I walked through what seemed like blurred streets. I finally found his house. \n\nWhen I got there I told him and he laughed when I cried. Because I had never experienced that feeling. \n\n10 years later, after that man I was with for 5 years, who said he would marry me one day, decided to cheat and leave. \n\nI had a few men in between, a few dates. And fell in love maybe once, or what I thought was love. And the older I get the heavier it feels. That it doesn’t matter where they love me or if I like them, something seems to always bring us down. Most times it’s them who decide to leave. Some try to come back but I’ll have moved on with my life. I’m 28 now, and I’m an attractive girl to everyone apparently, we don’t need to go there, im smart, financially healthy, physically healthy, mentally depleted, and feeling unwanted. \n\nSo should I maybe look into what this man claimed to have heard when he saw me? Because the older I get the more that night pops up\nInto my head. And my life changed completely after that one so called bf. \n\nI don’t wanna be alone forever. But I know some\nPeople who struggle because of many reasons and I think of people who are different, and how they might have hard times finding even a friend. And have to tell myself, what if that’s my destiny. Or what is he completely crazy, have u met him? Have I met you?\n\nAnyway the night popped up, and the night felt heavy. So here I am Reddit.

Three years and one relationship later though, I’ve successfully become an introvert and it fucking sucks. I miss having friends to talk with & play games with.

After me and my ex broke up, and quarantine hit, i realized just how much i depended on her for socializing. She was the only person i’d really talk to every day & hang out with at school. Afterwards, i did have people that i’d hang out with but once quarantine hit, we all just drifted apart. I miss having those close relationships with others. The ones where you could tell the other person all you troubles n shit. But it is what it is I guess.\n\nVideo games just aren’t the same by yourself. Youtube starts to become repetitive. I just wish I could have friendships like I did back in middle school. Growing up really does suck once all this starts happenin to ya! :)\n\nI just hope that shit gets better in university.

I've also gone without having any friends for a year and a half which I know is a very dumb idea but I think it's a lot better than someone having to listen to me be upset about a romantic interest tapering off until full on ghosting me. I also easily go off about things in my life that I probably shouldn't be telling people I hardly know and I don't know if that's Aspergers or from the fact that I literally have no friends and want to be closely connected to them.\n\nSo onto the things that I like. I am really interested in technology and I like fixing computers and smart phones. I'm not a professional nor have I gone to school for it it's just something I decided to do at the age of 15 since it'd be cheaper than paying someone else to fix that stuff. I enjoy art and photography and used to draw and take pictures myself (I want to get back into it at some point) and I enjoy looking at other people's work and admiring it. I've also made some things in Adobe Photoshop as well but I haven't done anything with that in a while either.\n\nVideo games are currently my dominating hobby and some of the games I like are Minecraft, Warframe, Grand Theft Auto Online (I've played many other GTA games too), The Sims (2, 3, and 4 but 4 is kind of bland), Need for Speed (I haven't played any of the newer ones), Watch Dogs 1 & 2, Saint's Row (1 & 2 are my favorites), etc. and we don't have to talk about gaming I just figure maybe someone really likes the above games or other games and maybe we could bond over that.\n\nI almost forgot to mention that I do all my online gaming on PC and I do game on console too. I also don't have brand loyalty to either Xbox, PlayStation or whatever Nintendo puts out because I go by what has the most games that appeal to me. I also tend to stay by myself in online games but I'm open to anyone who is willing to play with me but don't expect me to be the best because I just play to have fun. My PC is a 7 almost 8 year old gaming laptop and I'd figure I'd mention that just in case it causes issues later on down the line that and if I redo the thermal paste on the machine it's going to take me roughly 4 hours to do it along with dusting everything and cleaning the screen (just mentioning that as I might not be able to play with you if my laptop is in literal pieces).\n\nSome other random things I like are Spider-Man, Deadpool, Wonder Woman is pretty bad ass, Pokemon, Dragon Ball Z, and InuYasha (the character), crystals, and ASMR (no it's not a sex thing).\n\nI didn't want to put this at the top because I'm honestly at a point where beggars can't be choosers but so you know I'm a 27 year old male (going to be 28 in early November this year) and I live in the United States in the midwest.

Person B has to answer person A’s questions using the keyword. Person A wins if Person B fails to answer their question using the keyword. Person B wins if Person A cant ask anymore questions. Here’s an example since I suck at explaining things.\n\nPerson A: The keyword is Cake. What’s your name?\n\nPerson B: Venellope Von Cake\n\nPerson A: Where do you live?\n\nPerson B: Cakeland \n\nAnd on and on until someone loses like its stated above.
