It’s a retail job at a mall and I loved it when I was first there. The only reason I left was to just find something better. At least something to get me back on my feet while I keep working my side job (giving wine samples at different stores).\n\nI left for a year to do two terrible life insurance companies. When those didn’t work out, I went back to this retail job. Right now it’s a new manager; someone I worked with in the past. I was okay with her then despite some people not really liking her. When I found out she was manager, I was happy for her. But when I started, I admitted that I forgot A LOT since so much happened a year prior. Her responses were essentially “yeah, that’s what trainings for, buddy!”, and, “I was gone for awhile and I still remember everything!”.\n\nWhen I started, I went for their supervisor role and I was barely being scheduled (like going a whole week without being scheduled) and, in turn, barely being trained. Despite being shown a few things here and there maybe once, my manager expects me to know it off the bat despite showing me maybe a week or two prior ONE TIME. It’s worse when even if I make a small mistake or maybe I miss something on the group me and ask about it, my manager just talks down to me and treats me like I’m stupid. I genuinely hate it. Like if I get wording wrong on a sale and she hears it, she gets on to me in front of customers saying I need to stop ‘assuming’ what the sales are. And our store even tracks how many tote bags we sell, and because I’m barely being scheduled, my manager gets onto me for how low my tote sales are (gee! I wonder why).\n\nTo make it worse, my mall has a rule that anyone under the age of 18 must have an adult over 21 accompany them at all times/anyone 18 years old cannot be with anyone else younger than 21. I understand why this was put into place; a massive fight broke out last year started by a bunch of teenagers. I hate how complicated the rule is, and it’s harder when not every store in this mall is enforcing it. Our store is catered primarily to teens/young adults, so it gets stressful having to explain this to everyone who walks in and looks super young. My manager tried to compare it to me IDing shoppers when I give wine samples almost making it seem like I’d be dumb enough to serve to minors.\n\nI never wanted to come back indefinitely, just long enough to get my feet off the ground after struggling last year. Coming back here just feels like a nightmare now and I just want to leave. I’m barely being scheduled, barely being paid, so it isn’t even worth it. Once again, I have to rely on my job giving wine samples at stores. It’s not a great time in my life.\n\nTl;dr: went back to a job I love. New manager treats me poorly and barely schedules me. I have to rely on my side job again.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/12mqlsn/i_dont_even_want_to_go_to_work_tomorrow/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/12mqlsn/i_dont_even_want_to_go_to_work_tomorrow/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I was getting promoted at my job, had a good amount of friends, a beautiful girl was interested in me, and I was finally getting my life on track. Then everything went to shit.\n\nThe promotion never came cuz of high turnover. I started school so work and school together ruined my social life. A lot of my friends slowly lost touch with me. The girl I loved was in college on the other side of the country but was moving back near me soon, so I was excited to see her again and ask her out. But turns out she was just trying to fuck and when I told her that I liked her and thought she liked me, she simply responded that ‘like’ is a strong word and she doesn’t catch feelings for people. \n\nSo I quit my job at the end of last year and lost my friends I had there. And I lost a girl that was everything to me because it turns out I was nothing to her. And I stopped working out because of my depression I fell into. I cut myself off from the world.\n\nNow I’m trying to get it together which is terrifying. I got a new job which seems cool enough but the people there kinda suck. I’m back to working out but I can’t lift anywhere near what I could a few months ago and my body is in deep pain. I’m gonna go back to school in the summer. But no real friends besides a couple roommates. Not a great relationship with my family. A significant other seems laughable to me at this point. It just sucks because I wanted to die for so long and stopped caring. Now I’m slowly trying to get my life together, but the pain is still there and there’s no signs of it going away.

I was happy to see many replies and personal messages saying that it helped a bit with their loneliness. It was also interesting to see almost 2000 anonymous logs, and all the different reasons for their loneliness.\n\nAs you might expect, many felt lonely because they lacked romantic partners, closely followed by not having friendship. What was interesting though was what they thought attributed to their loneliness. Many found communication skill as what was holding them back, almost twice as many as those who said physical appearance was the cause.\n\nI wanted to do more with the webapp so that people don't just post how they feel like their shouting into the void, but actually verbally talk to others in similar situations so that they can work on their communication skill AND actually make meaningful connections with people across the globe.\n\nI was sprint-coding for the past 2 weeks so that I can have this audio chat feature ready by Valentines Day because I know this day can hurt so much for people without someone to spend with. I wanted to have it ready before Midnight, my apologies.\n\nI added a feature in the audio chat where, when you talk to someone and enjoy the conversation, you can send them a rose 🌹, which the receiver can use as a way to find you another day to continue the conversation.\n\nI plan to be on the platform for most of the day on V Day. I would love to talk to you as I have also previously suffered from loneliness and I vowed to myself to create something to help others who might be going through similar things now.\n\nIf you want to check it out, you can visit lonelyworld <dot> info (use . for <dot>)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllow me to end this by wishing you Happy Valentines Day.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/1120nnv/i_built_a_website_to_help_lonely_souls_find_each/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/1120nnv/i_built_a_website_to_help_lonely_souls_find_each/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

The idea was to allow a lonely person to report their loneliness anonymously and share their location on the map so that other people visiting the website can see that there are lots of people across the world going through the same thing.\n\nThe engagement was fantastic. There were over 700 visitors and more than 150 people reported being lonely. We actually saw people from all 7 continents - Antarctica reporting loneliness. \n\nIf the website was of any small help or consolation for anyone, I wanted to do more to help out. \n\nI since added a limited chat function so that people can share why they feel lonely, and how they are coping with it today. People who do not feel lonely can also contribute by sharing their past experiences and leaving suggestions.\n\nI think the first part of overcoming loneliness, or any problem for that matter, starts from recognizing the issue and identifying the factors leading up to the problem. I hope The Lonely World can help people with this first part.\n\nPlease feel free to check out the website and share any feedback. \n\n[https://lonelyworld.info](https://lonelyworld.info/)\n\nCheers,", "score": 8, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/10n9j0a/i_updated_the_lonely_world_website_because_it/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/10n9j0a/i_updated_the_lonely_world_website_because_it/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It showed a boy being in his room gaming to avoid meeting family members visiting. The dad is very gentle, supportive and patient with his son and brings the boy food for him so he doesn't have to leave the room to talk to his visiting family. The father says something like \"just come out when you are ready no pressure\". The poster of this comic says the kid gonna be super fucked up and prolly kill someone with a car when he grows up. \n\nI related so much to this comic it kinda shocked me how close it was minus the killing people as an adult part haha. But growing up I wasn't like ultra rich but my family was definitely more well off than most and could get most game consoles, pcs and go to a lot of nice restaurants. money wasn't a problem growing up, not so much now but that's a different topic. My parents were generally speaking pretty supportive, patient and gave me freedom to do what O want. I spent a majority of my free time as a child being a shut in, gaming, watching YouTube and shows. Other than some small chats to a few classmates during school. I can say I had 0 friends, physically weak, kinda chubby and only above average grades. I was surprisingly quite content it actually didn't bother me too much. My parents definitely seemed to worry but never really forced me to anything.\n\nObviously now that I've grown up in my early/mid 20s. I've changed a lot due to age, financial problems and work experience. I went to a college immediately after middle school underprepared and couldn't really get a job in the field  i wanted but at least got one semi related. I also at least made some friends for the first time in my life that I still talk to sometimes years later. worked for a bit over 2 years started break out of my shell during my employment. I also discovered what I wanted during work and self-studied a lot during that time before going back to school to study a field I'm passionate about. Got kinda into fitness and am in the best shape of my life though still got some hard to get rid of belly fat. In my current school I'm also moderately popular and an decent talker. People are surprised to hear me say I'm an introvert. I'm doing well grades wise and am pretty confident getting a job in my field after finishing school. Hell I even had a girl ask my contacts at a party after chatting a bit for first time. Now gonna go on my first ever date soon. Fingers crossed everything work out!\n\ntldr: My patient, supportive parents let me be a total shut in which messed up my teenage and early adult life. Delayed me growing up and learning a lot of lessons I should have earlier. Now turned my life around a lot.

I’m a 21M and have a similar story to many of you in the group: still a virgin, had a couple kisses but never a good one, been on a couple of dates that went nowhere, etc. Now I look back to summer of last year with deep pain. During that time I was really getting it together: I was about to be promoted at my job, school was going well for me for once, I was getting in the gym almost every day and gaining confidence, and I met a girl that I was instantly intrigued by. This girl was incredibly beautiful to me and shared a lot of my interests, and quickly she gravitated to me while we worked together. She was pretty shy but would take the time to talk to me and always greeted me with this amazing smile. But by the time the summer ended, she left across the country to college. I tried to keep in touch as much as I could, but then life got crazy for me too. Balancing school with work became an intense challenge, working out fell off as a result, and the promotion I was looking forward to fell through because they were understaffed. Then this girl moved back close to me and when we saw each other again, she quickly became flirty. One night we were sexting and she was planning to come over the next night, but those plans fell through and life was getting busy again so it was my last chance to see her for awhile. I became impatient and spilled all my feelings for her and she pretty much told me that she doesn’t catch feelings for people. I got drunk a night later and drunk texted her some nasty and forceful things and got blocked. So here I am, thinking just last week that something special was finally happening for me, but instead feeling as hopeless and lost as ever. I quit that job as it took a huge toll on me, still in school but have no idea where that will lead, and have been isolating myself and not working out. All my motivation in life feels lost because it seems like when things are coming together, everything eventually crumbles.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/1072wt9/scared_of_life_ahead/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonersEmpire/comments/1072wt9/scared_of_life_ahead/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}
