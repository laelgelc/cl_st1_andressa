(You can see that I posted on the hikikomori subreddit already). The main goal of my research is to better understand how solitary individuals live, the space they inhabit, and what it actually means to be \"doing nothing\" (i.e., it turns out people rarely do nothing), because what strikes me the most when I read papers on hikikomori/social withdrawal is that researchers don't really focus on the daily living arragements, on what people do or don't do, their aspirations, desires etc, usually those aspects are rather described in vague terms, and at times, research mainly overlooked what people mean by \"doing nothing\".\n\nSo my research interests are related to solitude as a practice, being in the world, dreaming, struggles of everyday life and \"making do\" in a way with what people have and don't have. I'm aware that you're not hikikomori, but I'm posting here because there might be some overlap between social withdrawal and seeking solitude. I will be happy to answer questions regarding this ethnography and myself. Also, if some of you want to contact me, I have an information sheet and an ethics consent form, with my name and the university I'm affiliated with, that I can send privately. This research is completely anonymous, and I usually use Discord to chat with participants (voice call and direct messaging only).\n\nThanks for reading, and my apologies if I posted in the wrong subreddit.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1qtsydy/ethnographic_research_on_social_withdrawal/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1qtsydy/ethnographic_research_on_social_withdrawal/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It all started with my parents' divorce, or rather their separation, which happened when I was 15. Around the same time, I was addicted to cannabis and hanging out with the wrong crowd.\n\nToday, I'm 26, and I've stopped trying to understand the reasons for all of this. The divorce, the move, and my bad influences have had a devastating effect, and I've started distancing myself from my friends, who have undoubtedly suffered, but now they don't want anything to do with me anymore.\n\nI feel like there's a huge void. It's as if, overnight, I lost everything. I used to be someone who was extremely loved. I had tons of friends all over the countryside around Lyon. My parents invited their adult friends over every weekend to my big house, so I knew their children and lived a dream life. In 2015, everything changed. No one saw the aggravating factor coming: my cannabis addiction and the gradual decline of my social circle, which isolated me.\n\nBut as I said, the problem isn't the past. The problem is that since that day, I've been trying to move forward, but nothing seems to work. I first tried Facebook dating groups shortly after I moved in 2017. Without much success, given the impossibility of knowing who you were meeting. Then, my parents literally forced me to study something I hated (construction, an exclusively male field). I suffered a lot because, since I didn't like those studies and there were only men in them, I couldn't see myself remaining friends. Furthermore, I have trouble understanding people from my own social background. Far be it from me to talk about \"segregation,\" as I've always been friends with people from very different social backgrounds. But at a certain point, I felt completely lost and went through a major identity crisis. After my vocational diploma, I started my first year of university, where my attachment to my previous life was reinforced. It was complicated because, as you know, the university is a large campus, and I was two years older than most of the students; it was difficult. The same thing happened in my bachelor's degree in international relations. In fact, the profiles offered weren't really a good fit for me, as there were a lot of intellectuals, sycophants, and tattletales. Yet, I'm very open-minded, but I've had many conflicts with classmates who, for their part, didn't understand me either.\n\nYears later, this persisted, even when I was working. Yet, I'm a kind, cheerful, rather extroverted girl, but above all, open-minded. I often think back to my \"old life\" with my childhood friends, even though no one wants to see me anymore. I don't know if others have ever experienced loneliness, but I'd really like to talk about it with you. I know there are two types of loneliness: imposed loneliness and accepted loneliness. For me, it's more than just a challenge, even though, of course, when I distanced myself from my childhood friends \"because\" of bad influences, it was actually me who wanted to create some distance, and that suited me perfectly. This loneliness makes me believe I'll never find a husband, never have friends, never have children, and never own a home. I don't know what to do with my days; I wake up in the morning feeling dizzy, but of course, I always end up having good days because I always find a way to keep myself busy.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how to organize my life without my friends, without real friends to go out with, party with, and eat out with, like most young people my age (26). I feel like this loneliness will inevitably lead me to a life I didn't choose: without friends, it's a vicious cycle, and you never meet anyone. I've already talked to quite a few people, and I know that sports, community activities, and so on are good ways to connect with others. But for now, I lack the motivation to get involved in those kinds of projects. Especially since, on the other hand, my family isn't really supporting me, and I've already tried activities during my isolation period, without much success.\n\nThank you in advance for your help…", "score": 3, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1qrzfhg/immense_suffering_from_loneliness_family_problems/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1qrzfhg/immense_suffering_from_loneliness_family_problems/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Despite it’s pedestrian routine and the common predictability of it all, his young life in that desolate place held a certain magic. Fluff dandelion tendrils rocketing soft off his breath, the touch of a cold metal mule bit. Even their dilapidated porch gave promise to the miles and miles of flat earth that lay ahead.

He set his mind to another time, a time of rope and ride as a young cowhand traveling the countless cattle trading outposts of Colorado and Wyoming. He was handsome then; inclined towards rodeo, rippling summertime creeks and bunkhouse whiskey. Tack pianos poured out ragtime tunes at every new town. Dancing girls in brothels, saloon floors stained in blood, all wrapped tightly in the electric shock of possibility. \n\nIt was a transient life, a fortune known only in youth; to be equalled in both poverty and capability, all the while mired in the momentary bliss of adventure.

When he listened close to the smoldering embers, the falling snow; he saw floating apparitions of dandelion tendrils and felt the pounding of a thundering herd and it all convalesced into an orchestra of empty embrace. \n\nHe made his final peace. His fortune now existed somewhere behind him. The cowboy surrendered it without quarrel and reckoned maybe, on a long enough timeline, that’s where all great fortune is found. \n\nThey beckoned.\n\nAt first light, he beat back against the freezing dawn with an icy gaze that left the frosted air outside his window little choice but to rise.

It’s like I am so sensitive to even the tiniest bit of friend interaction or plans. Big money stress also…all combined have made me retreat off of social media as well because I am just easily triggered by posts by friends or the guilt of not reaching out/worry of being a bad friend, but also absolutely needing to retreat. I even feel guilty about not interacting with friend’s posts or the thought of me becoming irrelevant because I haven’t been active on there like I usually am. \n\nMaybe it’s partially an identity crisis or is social media really affecting my psyche more now than it ever has? (Silly question I know)\n\nI know I’m not alone in this I just need maybe someone who is on the other side of this to help me with their input to not worry and keep chugging along.

The cultural imperative of \"Don't just sit there, do something\" was more than a mere suggestion; it was an ingrained operating system, a voice that whispered, to be valuable, \"we must always be in motion, always planning, always producing, always chasing\". \nThis was not a conscious choice but a deeply embedded and borrowed program, a societal consensus I had never dared to question. I believed that my worth was directly proportional to my busyness, that to pause was to fall behind, and that to be still was a form of laziness. My identity was built on a foundation of constant activity, and to remove that was to risk personal collapse.\nThe initial days and weeks of solitude were therefore not peaceful. They were a battle. My mind, stripped of its constant to-do lists and external distractions, did not find a quiet sanctuary. Instead, it was flooded with a deep, gnawing sense of \"guilt, as though I'd wasted precious time\".\n\nThis was a painful process of confronting a profound addiction. The sensation was akin to a physical detox, where the body writhes in agony from the sudden absence of a substance it has come to depend on. My discomfort was not a personal failing; it was a direct, predictable, and even a healthy reaction to the sudden removal of a deeply ingrained cultural addiction to productivity. The pain was evidence that the old program was being challenged, not that the new path was a mistake. The discomfort was a necessary rite of passage, a sign of true change beginning. It was an agonizing confrontation with a deep-seated fear of falling behind, a feeling born of a culture that \"worships busyness\" and measures a person's worth in \"productivity, in achievements, in the size of our to-do lists\".\nMy journey began not with a surrender to peace but with a fierce internal resistance to the forced stillness. I felt as though the very fabric of my being was unraveling. The absence of noise and task lists was not a relief but a terrifying void, filled only with the clamor of my own insecurities and a relentless voice demanding to know what I was doing to prove my existence. The simple act of breathing without an agenda felt like an act of rebellion. I was a person who had always moved, and now I was a person who was learning to be. \nThis initial agony was the first and most critical lesson of my time in solitude. The paradox was this: the only way to heal from a world addicted to motion was to sit still long enough to feel the pain of withdrawal from that motion. The suffering of those first months was the fertile ground from which all future understanding would grow.\n\n\nThe Unveiling of the Game:\n\nAs the noise of the outside world faded and the initial battle within my mind began to subside, my perception underwent a profound shift. Watts describes how the world is held together by \"agreements\" , a series of collective fictions we all agree to believe in—that money has meaning, that clocks measure something real, that careers and titles matter. My solitude stripped these agreements of their hypnotic power. The three-year detox from their relentless reinforcement allowed me to see the world not as a serious, life-or-death struggle, but as a vast, beautifully intricate \"board game\". The anxieties and dramas that had once consumed me now appeared as trivial as arguing over plastic pieces on a cardboard map.\nThis new vision was a double-edged sword. To \"see what others don't\" meant to feel an immense sense of liberation, but also a profound isolation. I realized I was a person \"no longer hypnotized by the same spell\" as the rest of society. This created a lonely position. Friends and family, still deeply invested in the rules of the game, could not comprehend my newfound lack of ambition or my detachment from their \"little dramas\". As Watts points out, \"if you tell them this, they won't thank you. They'll say you're spoiling the game\". And in a sense, I was. I had stepped out of the consensual reality and could not pretend it was all real again.\nThe wisdom, however, was not to withdraw entirely or to become a cynical preacher. The true goal was to \"play the game knowingly\".\nMy solitude was not an escape from life, but an education in how to live it more gracefully. The three-year period provided the necessary distance to detox from the cultural conditioning that had convinced me the game was reality. This detachment led to a clarity of vision that was initially painful, but which ultimately necessitated a profound shift in my attitude. I learned to \"eat, work, love, create,\" but with a lightness, with \"a twinkle in my eye\". The purpose of my detox was not to stop acting, but to \"act more freely,\" knowing that my worth was not tied to the costume I wore or the role I played. This transformation from isolation to clarity to a playful engagement with the world was the central arc of my journey.\n\n\nThe Art of Unbeing Bothered:\n\nMy three-year retreat became a forced masterclass in a profound internal truth. In the absence of daily friction and drama, I came to confront a startling truth about the nature of my own suffering. I was forced to realize that \"what bothers you is your reaction,\" not the external event itself. The world had never actually bothered me. The sting of an insult or the frustration of being ignored was not the action itself, but my interpretation of it. The three-year period without the constant drama of human interaction was a forced immersion in the art of non-acceptance. The lesson of the monk who returns an unaccepted gift became a lived reality: if someone offers you a gift and you do not accept it, to whom does it belong? Insults and judgments are gifts you do not have to take. If you refuse them, they remain with the giver.\nMy solitude revealed the central character of the \"game\" I had been playing: my ego. You can call it \"the character you think you are,\" a thing that is \"fragile, always hungry for validation, always afraid of rejection\". The detox was, in essence, an ego-ectomy. By removing the sources of external praise and criticism for three years, the ego’s power source was cut off. It withered. What was left was the un-fragile, steady \"awareness behind it\". This awareness was untouchable, a witness to the unfolding of life. The ego's dependence on the social matrix became starkly clear; it is a social construct that cannot survive in isolation without constant reinforcement. The \"detox\" was the deliberate deconstruction of that matrix, and the ability to be unbothered was the lasting outcome.\n\nMy solitude also offered a new perspective on those who had once bothered me most. I came to see them not as enemies but as unwitting teachers. \"The one who irritates you is showing you exactly where you are, not free\". The detox from constant social interaction gave me the perspective to see this truth. I was no longer in the immediate moment of conflict, but observing from a distance. \nWhen I eventually re-entered society, I could look at a harsh word or an ignorant action and think, \"Ah, this is their storm, not mine,\" and simply \"let it pass\". This is the core strength learned in solitude. It is not about building walls or isolating oneself, but about becoming like \"water, soft, flexible, unresisting\" in the face of conflict. A mountain does not argue with the wind; it simply stands. The person who is truly unbothered is not a doormat but a mountain of stillness in the chaos of the world.\n\n\nThe Intelligence of Silence:\n\nThe culmination of my journey was the realization that silence, which began as a terrifying void, was not a void at all. As Watts notes, \"silence is not empty... It is full\". Initially, it was a space I rushed to fill \"with noise, chatter, music, activity\". But as I endured the initial discomfort, I discovered a \"stillness at the core of my being,\" a calm depth beneath the waves of thought. This fertile emptiness is what the sages of India call shunyata, a presence far greater than any noise I could have created. It is the foundation upon which everything rests.\nThe greatest surprise of my solitude was not what I learned, but what was revealed to me. Watts says creativity is \"born of silence\". I found this to be profoundly true. Without the constant mental clatter, \"new insights arise. Creativity blossoms\". My best ideas, my deepest intuitions, came not from forcing them but from sitting quietly, being open and receptive. The universe, through my silence, was \"breathing ideas into me\". My mind was no longer a frantic factory of thought but a receptive mirror reflecting a deeper intelligence.\nThis led to the ultimate expression of the lessons learned: the paradox of effortless action, known in the East as wu wei. \nMy life no longer requires \"frantic control\". Just as \"water never tries to force its way yet it wears down mountains,\" my actions now flow from a deeper sense of alignment. I learned to \"stop trying to bully it, manipulate it, control it, to relax, and let the universe breathe through you\". Silence became the central force that dismantled my old patterns and allowed this new flow to emerge. It was the catalyst that connected the initial pain of detox to the final state of effortless grace. True, lasting change came not from doing more, but from daring to be still and allowing the intelligence of silence to do its work.\n\nThis is not a theoretical model but a lived reality, a transformative journey that can be mapped by the changes it precipitates. The experience shifts one's very mode of being from a conditioned state to a conscious one.\n\n\nThe Transformative Journey Matrix: \n\nA Shift from Conditioned to Conscious Being\n| Before Solitude (The Conditioned Self) \n| After Solitude (The Conscious Self) |\nDoing is my value. | Being is my nature. | External noise is a comfort.| Internal silence is a home.| Control is the goal. | \nTrust is the foundation. | Effort is required for growth. | Effortless action is discovered.\nExternal events define me. | Internal awareness guides me. |\n| The game is real. | The game is a play.\n\n\nReturning to the Unfolding:\n\nThe most profound realization of my entire three-year journey was that there was never a finish line. All my life, I had been running a race I had imagined, a frantic chase for some elusive destination. But \"life was never meant to be a race... it was meant to be lived, savored, experienced\". The fear of \"falling behind\" that haunted me at the start of my detox, a feeling born of the endless hustle, dissolved into the understanding that \"you were already where you wanted to be\". This final realization is the true gift of solitude; the discovery that the peace and completeness one seeks is not found at the end of a long struggle but is the very ground of being itself.\n\nReturning to the world, I am not a defeated man but a liberated one. The paradox of the three-year detox is that \"freedom is not found in controlling others\" but in a profound internal shift. I am now like water, soft, flexible, unresisting, a person who can stand in the marketplace, hear the noise, see the chaos, and remain centered. -This is not indifference but a hard-won peace that cannot be disturbed by external conditions. \n\nI have re-entered the world with a fundamentally different operating system. The purpose of my departure was not to stay away, but to learn how to be truly present. The detox prepared me for a new, more meaningful engagement with the world I had previously fled.\n\nIn the end, my detox was a detour to find the shortest path back to myself. You don't have to fix yourself. You were never broken. \nThe three years of silence were a slow, patient process of removing the layers of conditioned thinking that convinced me otherwise. My journey led to the simple, radical, and undeniable truth that \"simply by being, you are already enough\". My life is no longer a frantic chase, a struggle to become, or a demand to be unbothered. It is an unfolding, a dance with the flow of existence itself. And in that dance, I have found a joy, a peace, and a freedom that all my striving could never manufacture.\n\n", "score": 11, "num_comments": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1nm844k/three_years_alone_in_solitude_breaking_down_to/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1nm844k/three_years_alone_in_solitude_breaking_down_to/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Try to know their intentions.", "selftext": "\n\nSo, this is a short story happened to me long back. Our family went to a temple where we met our family friend with their daughter there. Before that I've seen her thrice, but we never talked. (I'm an introvert & socially awkward person.) The temple was exhaustingly crowded, where in I saved her multiple times from falling down. After that, She talked to me in a friendly way. After that, she took our pics, I took their pics(as I'm not interested in pics, I usually photographs the people in the meets). Later she sent me those pics via watsapp but I forgot to send the pics I've taken,  which I've sent them 2days later. I was guilty for not being punctual. I've sent her those pics & asked \"sorry for being late. Btw how do u do?\"...No response for 2days(I thought maybe she's busy, i shouldn't have asked that, i might be disturbing her) & then she replied 2days later \"good, Wt Abt u?\"...I said, \"good ma'am. R u busy, Am I disturbing?\"...no reply since then, & she deleted or blocked my num, god knows!!\nmy problem here is..... I did not have any ill intentions. I genuinely asked her if I was disturbing her, cuz I don't know how & when to talk to others being an introvert. Still, I don't think she's wrong. She's right in her own way. She must have got offended or creeped out by my words. But It did hurt me. Maybe I won't talk to women from now on(atleast I don't start a convo). Cuz, I don't want myself to think a 100 time, before i message. ikik, All women won't be the same. I don't wanna generalize all the women & say \"women, plz know that if someone is being nice to u, doesn't mean he's hitting on u\".  I know all females aren't like that, atleast in this sub. Cuz i acknowledge that women should be cautious & careful. But u can ask right? Yeah yeah! How can u ask?...how can a girl ask somone if he's just being nice to her or being interested in her? \n\nI understand.\n\nIt's my mistake. \n\nI don't see gender. I talk to everyone in the same way, cuz I see a friend in 'em. That's it. I shouldn't have extended the convo..should have sent the pics & stayed calm. She's been friendly..so I thought, it's a formality to ask the  howabouts.\n\nI guess, things like these make u realize the bliss in solitude. How happy can u be in solitude. It's u! It's in u! Everything that makes u happy should be within u. Never seek happiness from others. Be a self-satisfied soul.\n\nThanks!

I am 28 years old and I come from Poland – the land of the Piasts, with a rich history. But history is the past. It will never happen again. Today, in the 21st century, the year 2025 appears to be the negation of the values that our ancestors once cultivated.\n\nValues... they are our soul. And this is not only about the soul of a Pole, a Japanese person, or an American. It’s the soul of humanity. Culture is its manifestation – just like the world we create, the path we follow, and who we are: first as individuals, then as nations, and ultimately as a global community.\n\nReligions are also a product of the soul. They try to give meaning to what goes beyond the senses – God, angels, spirits, the enlightened mind of Buddha. In today’s world, religions are losing significance, which – paradoxically – may be a good sign. It doesn’t mean the end of faith, but the beginning of a new understanding of it. We don’t have to abandon spirituality. On the contrary – this is the time to revive it, renew it, and understand it more deeply than ever before.\n\nOur world has forgotten its roots – the ancestors who shaped the human soul. And although it is painful, it is also natural. The evolution of civilization requires change. When we satisfy basic needs – physical and psychological – a desire for something more arises: meaning, ideas, creation.\n\nThat’s why I do not reject material prosperity. In fact, I believe it is necessary – as a foundation. But only if it serves creation, not mindless consumption. Today’s world does not create – it devours. We live in a culture of excess, which confuses comfort with meaning. Pleasure with spirituality. Power with value.\n\nMan is extraordinary. This is a fact. No other period in the history of Earth has one species dominated the planet like Homo sapiens. But with great power came pride. And now it is not animals that are our enemies – it is ourselves. We fight not for survival, but for pleasure. Not for life, but for luxury. And in this battle, we lose our soul.\n\nWe let ourselves be enslaved – by systems, by the media, by illusions of happiness. Our brains have become addicted to dopamine, to false rewards: objects, likes, drugs, superficial sex. We are programmed. Every day, with every advertisement, with every message – someone else shapes our thoughts. Unconsciously, we give in to what weakens us. Because we no longer know how to distinguish value from illusion.\n\nBut this doesn’t mean we must get rid of the ego. The ego is the core of our soul, of our individuality. There is no need to be ashamed of it. We need to understand it. To tame it. Because an inflated ego is an ego that crushes others. An ego that doesn’t allow others to flourish. And every ego, every soul – is a unique manifestation of life. And Earth gives it the right to exist.\n\nThe Earth... our home. We have created a civilization that destroys it. We cut down forests, build concrete walls, construct roads that lead nowhere – except to our own self-destruction. We’ve forgotten that the deepest peace comes from contact with nature. It is the Earth that gives us life – and it can take it away. Coexistence with it is not a return to the past. It is the future – truly advanced, wise, spiritual.\n\nI am not calling for the halt of progress. On the contrary – I call for its purification. For the creation of a world where technology serves the soul, not suppresses it. A world where humanity is not a parasite, but a guardian. A god who creates – not destroys.\n\nFree brothers and sisters!\n\nDo not abandon your spirit. Do not blindly believe what the system tells you. Do not lose faith in yourselves. Each of you has a gift – a unique perspective, a unique soul, an unparalleled voice. Share it, create, set it free. Let no power, no idea, and no ego suppress you!\n\nTake care of yourselves – your will, your mind, your soul. Take care of the Earth. It gave birth to us. And only with it – as a partner, not a master – do we have a chance to survive and rise higher.\n\nI feel you. I am with you – in spirit, in thought, in idea. Although time and space divide us – our hearts beat with one rhythm.\n\n \n\n", "score": 5, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1jzvb2l/the_manifestation_of_free_spirit/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1jzvb2l/the_manifestation_of_free_spirit/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Cognitive dissonance forced me to reevaluate my existence, and in the end, I deliberately decided to change my environment. All this hustle and bustle oppresses me. Perhaps my \"conscious\" decision is not rooted in rational analysis but driven by emotional and psychological impulses. Maybe this \"escape\" is merely an attempt to run away from my problems.

Yet, I am grateful to those who took the time to read these words, even if they had their own motives and interests. I dream of retreating to forests and mountains, living in solitude. I want to take books with me to fill my time, study sciences I have yet to explore, master survival skills, and improve my physical condition. I aim to find inspiration, to comprehend the incomprehensible. Perhaps this departure will be my reward. My request is simple: how can I make this dream a reality? How can I leave unnoticed, as if I never existed? Even if I face legal challenges, I am ready to take the risk if it truly aligns with my desire. How can I disappear from all radars if I’m only 16?

{"id": "1b3r0gl", "subreddit": "solitude", "created_utc": 1709288484, "author": "Toti200126", "title": "Sociality is a weakness of the human mind", "selftext": " Human beings often love to extol their need for companionship and love as something we should be proud of. I have sincerely never been able to grasp how someone could be proud of something that we need. It is like being proud of the fact that we suffer and die if we do not eat or sleep.\n\nThese people who extol sociality seem to forget how human interactions were born. Our ape-like ancestors needed to survive in a harsh environment and lacked proper teeth, nails or strength to defend themselves. They managed to live on by helping each other. Time passed and our nature transformed to make us more sociable. We created morals and standards to regulate our community life. In the process, all individuals who did not conform enough to the standards were severely punished. This is something people who praise sociality often forget: building society was a bloodbath of those who did not conform enough.\n\nWe surely learned to create and express thoughts and information more than other animals, but we also built conformism and a psychological void in the human psyche. In order to have free space for morals and social upbringing in the mind of individuals, we needed to remove or repress all instincts we had before. When a human baby is born, it has no instincts but impulses. These impulses are then transformed by society to turn the individual into a member of society. This is done through blackmail. Parents and educators teach the child to appreciate their love and approval, and then threaten to stop loving or approving it if its deeds do not conform to expectations. Love is the blackmail society uses to conform individuals to expectations.\n\nWe feel the need to be acknowledged by others because we lost our self in exchange for a social self. In natural selection, those who did not feel the need to conform were not trusted enough by others, so they were often persecuted as enemies. The people who keep some traces of our former unsocial state are the sociopaths, the criminals, the egoists, the arrogant as well as the free thinkers, the hermits and the introverted. They have in common, to various degrees, the capability to find value in themselves and desire independence from morals and conformity. I am not saying these people do not feel any need of human interaction. I am underlining how such people are admirable for being annoyed by human sociality and the need of constantly being acknowledged by others.\n\nSomeone may consider me a hypocrite for writing against sociality in a post which is meant to be read by others. I am, in fact, not annoyed by our capability to share information and work together towards a goal. This is a wonderful capability. The problem is, it is not just a capability. It is a need. I hate the fact that we feel the need of being with others and we mostly fail to find value in our life independently from others.\n\nWhat I dream of is a new humanity who could be able to not suffer loneliness anymore. We could still communicate if we like to, but we would be perfectly able to thrive even if we do not love anyone, even if have no friends. We would not need to rely on the opinion of others to find value in ourselves. We would be the ones who decide our worth.\n\nHow will we create this new humanity? By endorsing transhumanism. The transhumanist is the one who wants to fully control itself and break free from bonds and limits of our nature. Please mind that I am not endorsing violence against others. That is just a rough temptation and turns into sterility. If we practice violence, this project will be not trusted and stopped. I have no interest on imposing anything on others, I just want to change my capabilities. As I said, I want to not feel any need for human interaction anymore. I also think anyone would benefit in their individuality by this independence. The best way to implement this project is using neuroscience. Maybe we could build a technology enabled to stop the feelings of depression caused by loneliness. The technology does not necessarily have to be irreversible. We could build a helmet which protects us from negative feelings and breaks the deterrent of pain when it comes to follow our ambitions and desire even if others despise it. We will become Individual Gods if we do so. Like the ancient Greek gods, who did not feel the lack of anything and still did things like eating or talking just for enjoyment, not with need.\n\nI do not hate others for existing. I just realize that only when I am alone, I am able to fully do what I want. In some cases, people are to blame to coerce conformity. If you mock others for what they wear or how they behave, you are contributing to the dictatorship of conformity. In other cases, the simple presence of others creates a boundary for our desires. That is why we should strive to endure solitude more. So that we can build even more our individual identity and make it independent from the external world.", "score": 25, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1b3r0gl/sociality_is_a_weakness_of_the_human_mind/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/1b3r0gl/sociality_is_a_weakness_of_the_human_mind/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

This makes me a good friend, a safe and stable companion for the people around me and it grants me a lot of safety in my life. But please remember this have a cost, please remember that every smile is a choice and that, somehow, it never full-fill the emptiness inside. \n\nI think we all felt like this, impossible to understand ourselves at a point that makes us give up on everything. Give up in the meaning of thing, just keep smiling and hoping it will be ok somehow if we keep doing our best happy face. \n\nBut for real, where is the warm ? Where is the thing that give us the feeling we're alive for something, for someone, where is this trust ? Does this have to be this way ? Are we doomed to forget our child dreams and to become a part of this big empty world we saw the adults in as we were kid ?\n\nI'm not alone, i got awesome roommates, friends, a loving cat, i even knew a very deep love and i kept somes friends from my childhood that i've being seing for now more than 15 years, so why do i feel so cold somehow ? Why the only name of this solitude make me wanna hide and cry ? Is it because the universal is a big empty place where we have the feeling that everything we do is just a distraction from the lack of meaning we all suffer ? \n\nThe more time goes, and the more i just want to disappear and watch the story of the universe without interfere, and the more i feel like i'm gonna forget every warm feeling i had when i used to dream about being an artist and change the world. \n\nSomehow, i now feel like this is just how we're suppose to be, getting further away from the naive emotion of the child to find happiness even in the contemplation of the sad and unfair reality.

Je n'ai pas d'amis ( des potes oui mais il y a une distinction) et je commence à me dire de plus en plus que après la fin de mes études je suis voué à rester seul. \n\nSuis-je timide ? Non pas du tout ! La seule chose que je n'aime pas c'est faire le premier pas (et encore), une fois la première conversation amorcé ça passe tout seul j'adore échangé, je m'entends très facilement avec les gens. Sinon plus jeune j'ai toujours eu beaucoup d'ami. Je sortais énormément, je faisais beaucoup de rencontre mais petit à petit j'ai perdu tout ses amis et ma vie social aussi. Maintenant ma vie se résume à aller en cours, rentrer et rester chez moi aller au sport dormir et rebelote.\n\nHonnêtement j'ai pas à me plaindre de mon intégration dans ma classe ( je suis en étude supp) je m'entends bien avec tout le monde et parle avec tout le monde, ça arrive qu'on se fasse des sorties étudiante mais c'est tout. J'ai qlq très bon camarades mais je n'ai pas réussi à me construire d'amitié au sens pur.\n\nAvant cette année scolaire, j'étais en année de césure c'était une période horrible j'étais vraiment au fond du trou je sortais pas du tout, je restais dans ma chambre des jours et des jours d'affilés, 0 message et je faisais une dépression. Je me disais que j'avais encore l'opportunité de me faire des amis quand je reprendrais mes études avec qui sortir, à qui me confier SURTOUT  au final non.. le peu d'espoir que j'avais et qui me faisait tenir c'est juste écroulé\n\nLa je rentre à nouveau dans une période de questionnement, quand j'imagine ma vie après les études elle se résume juste à aller au travail rentrer dormir et rebelote encore une fois de plus. Pas d’interaction social, pas d'ami, 0 messages juste rien moi et ma propre conscience, le néant. Tout ça me débite. J'ai 0 espoir en l'avenir qu'on se le dise, 85% des rencontres amicales se crée dans un contexte scolaire ou les amis d'amis.\n\n Des fois quand je vois des groupes d'ami, des publications ect je peux pas m’empêcher de les envier pas dans le mauvais sens du termes mais plus dans le sens \"alala c'est trop cool la chance\". Il y a TEELLLLLEEEMNT d'activité que j'aimerais bien faire de partir en week-end à manger au resto ou juste s’assoir sur un banc à parler, TOUT me va, rien faire me va aussi j'aimerais juste avoir UN seul vrai ami.  Toutes ses désirs, j'ai que fait les refouler étant donné qu'ils ne sont pas réalisable, ça a fait de moi quelque chose de vide à l'intérieur, je désire plus rien je suis inerte. Certaines personnes idéalise les sorties solo mais il faut faire la distinction entre sortir avec ses amis et faire des sorties solo de temps en temps et sortir tout le temps tout seul simplement parce qu'on a pas d'amis. \n\nBref ma vie se résume vraiment à rien elle a pas de sens et je me demande vraiment la nécessité de celle-ci, ma présence sur terre ne sert à rien je suis juste la à reste h24 dans mon studio (pas suicidaire juste 100% objective je garde toujours ma lucidité) Encore un samedi soir où j'attends impatiemment lundi pour retourner en cours afin revoir des gens (d'ailleurs je me trouve tellement pathétique à penser comme ça chaque vendredi soir ou début de vacance). \n\nUne info supplémentaire, j'ai pas d’interaction social que se soit amical mais aussi familiale ou dans un contexte sportif ou autre. \n\nJ'attends pas forcément de réponse. Comme j'étais entrain de déprimer et que je faisais des recherche sur la solitude je suis tombé sur des forums et je me suis pourquoi pas m'exprimer.\n\nPS: si vous voulez répondre svp ne me parlez pas de psychologue spécialiste ou quoi + la suffisance à soit meme ", "score": 7, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/18epm0j/je_nai_pas_vraiment_dinteraction_social/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/18epm0j/je_nai_pas_vraiment_dinteraction_social/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Aside from one day when my dad came up to “fix something” (check in on me) I didn’t see a human near my place. Running into town for groceries, wine, and wine was the only true contact I had with people. Even a lovely couple out on a trail merely smiled and waved. \n\nTook up a new hobby in writing, whether that’ll become a thing or a passing fad, who knows. I enjoy it for now. The camera was dusted off for the first time in ages. I found a few new podcasts that will keep me entertained/interested for a while. 6 books are now off my “must read” list and I can finally remove them from the pile on my night table. I ran far too much. Ouch. \n\nA lot of comments from friends made me chuckle.\n\n“Aren’t you scared up there all alone?”  Nope. \n\n“When you get back will you become the hermit cat lady?” Ha! Nope.

Perhaps. \n\nThe million dollar question is, would I do this again?  Absolutely yes. Two weeks may have been a bit much, but a week or so every few months feels like a worthy goal. Winter may impact that as I don’t want to be stuck, but worse things have happened. \n\nSo to any of you thinking about getting away for a bit. Anywhere. For any amount of time. Just do it. Your friends, family, and the world will still be there when you get back.

Through out my life I have always been alone. As a single child and an introvert I have realized, through suffering and contemplating upon the scriptures, I am the Solitude itself experiencing the aloneness through the physical body and mind.\n\nDeleting all my social media accounts further deepened my esoteric understanding of solitude.\n\nIt is only solitude that will help you to understand the occult studies like Astrology and holistic philosophies of the world.\n\nSolitude helps your mind by removing the \"key\" from the \"monkey\" as solitude itself becomes the \"key\" to unlock the \"monk's\" mind.\n\nTwo of my favourite verses from the scriptures for you to help turn the depressive solitude to meditative solitude:\n\nब्रह्मैवाहं समः शान्तः सच्चिदानन्दलक्षणः।\nनाहं देहो ह्यसद्रूपो ज्ञानमित्युच्यते बुधैः\n\n- Aparokshānubhuti verse 24\n\nTranslated:\nI am verily Brahman, being equanimous, quiescent, and by nature absolute Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. I am not the body which is non-existence itself. This is called true Knowledge by the wise.\n\nExplained:\nBrahman is the ultimate reality that is you, me and everyone and else. Our real nature is that of Existence itself, Consciousness itself, Bliss itself. These are not external emotions felt in the mind alone. But we are IT. We cannot be this body as body is degrading all the time. Which one are you in the changing nature of the body? The child? The adult? Or the old? You cannot be all of them at once. If you can be all of them then you should not be changing. But despite all the changes you still say it \"I am this body\". Enquire deeper and you will find that the \"I\" is different from the body and mind. This way of self-enquiry is called to be the thinking of the wise. 🕉️\n\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n\nYeshua said:\nIf you do not fast from the world,\nyou will not find the Kingdom.\n If you do not celebrate the Sabbath as a Sabbath,\n you will not know the Father.\n\n- Gospel of Thomas Logion 27\n\nExplained:\nThis is a good saying by Jesus regarding solitude. To fast from the world is to manifest our freedom in relation to it. We\n must leave the city in order to see its real skyline. A time of retreat is necessary for a truly human life. This also includes going away from social media and too much socialising in modern terms. This is the deep meaning of shabbat, a word\n which literally means “a stopping.” (When contemporary Israelis needed a\n word for a labor strike, they coined the word chevita, a derivative of shabbat.)\n. The importance of Shabbat to the Jewish people is well known. Each\n week, individuals stop doing and thereby wrest away the world and\n human life from the iron, mechanical grip of production. People take the\n time to be, to sit before God.\n This is also a day when humans are equal. They drop their social and\n professional roles and are simply human beings. Their universal family, all\n members of which are descendants from God, allows them also to discover this same movement as a kinship with all creatures.\n To bring Shabbat into our life is to introduce a time of stopping and\n of returning—even in the midst of our agitated state—to our essential\n being. It means taking the time to ask the great questions, such as “What\n is the real motive of my action? Who is it who thinks? Who am I?”\n The Shabbat is also a moment of halting our churning mental appara-tus, when time is suspended . . . Then it is possible for a flame to burn from\n the heart of humanity, an echo of the pure and simple I AM which is our real nature as Brahman  (refer to the first verse). 🕉️", "score": 15, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/13yiqky/benefits_of_solitude/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/13yiqky/benefits_of_solitude/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

All the gaslighting that human connection is the pinnacle of existence - I fell for it all.\n\nThe reason I now love solitude is because there is no human connection to be found. Believe me, I tried. I'm extremely open and will bond over any little thing (food etc).\n\nHowever, most people are very closed off, will judge you to your face to feed their starving egos. I've had people tell me they've switched off all their feelings and any capacity for love. I'd had people say they'd rather die than be vulnerable.\n\nMost people are obsessed with a toxic parent, sibling or lover and there's no room for a second person in their life. People are so codependent they will phone you for 2 minutes then run away to be a servant to all their family - making elaborate meals and giving lifts... all to get love that I could just give them. But no. Gotta be the big status stuff like marriages, pleasing cold parents and pointlessly making kids...all for approval. Normal approval from peers means nothing.\n\nEven if I get myself into romantic \"big status\" relationships (the only thing we're allowed apart from being a servant to our parents) so I can grab my own validation - the other person will likely be incapable of giving and only take. It makes me way more lonely than just being single.\n\nPointless empty draining interaction, whether I'm talking with a boring coworker I just met or a hot girl I met on a dating app who watches the same shows. Same old perfectionist, shallow, never vulnerable, always one-upping you crap. Like a needy child. Unless they want something. Then they're a perfect companion.\n\nAdd this to all the gaslighting of \"love love love is all you need and it's everywhere\" and you get an existence of just being your own friend. Which is hard. However, I think it's the shame that comes from all the fantasies we're taught to believe as soon as we're born - that our parents are capable of seeing us as full separate beings and romance is work but very fun work and you get closer because of the work. That relationships get deeper over time (very untrue). \n\nEven in schools, all the focus is on others - group work, talking about family, \"Who is Your Hero\" projects and books about how much a parent loves a child, etc etc. We're trained to leave ourselves behind and focus on others' minds.\n\nAs soon as I realized what I was looking for was a fantasy, I began to love my solo existence.", "score": 28, "num_comments": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/zi21kh/the_fantasy_of_human_connection/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/zi21kh/the_fantasy_of_human_connection/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I was the only introvert (and highly solitary person) in our group of 6. The trip was rough for me, but I knew it would be, and I think I did my best to be a good sport for the group (quiet and alone time was found at the roulette table where others got bored a lot faster than I did). \n\nFirst encounter started at the pool. A hotel pool that felt like a club (everything in vegas is a club) and had hundreds and hundreds of drinking adults and a decent number of children, too. I was lagging a bit behind our group, and when I got in I said hello to a guy about my age sipping a white claw against the pool wall, alone. We immediately started talking - innocent, random things. The other people in my group were very concerned and surprised that I was talking to a stranger. After several minutes, I tried to bring him into the \"group\" conversation, and he revealed that he had traveled to Las Vegas alone. As soon as we had separated from him, my group said it was a 'red flag' to travel alone to Las Vegas. \n\nNext up was a drag brunch show. The host picked on a few people up front, one of whom was alone and was local, and roasted her in front of the whole crowd for coming to see a drag show by herself. \n\nLastly was a cirque du soleil show. Same thing - comedian comes on stage, picks on a few people up front, and roasts a dude in front of hundreds of people for coming to the show and to vacation to Vegas alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - I was stoked and validated to find three people enjoying vegas in solitude, and witnessed how uncomfortable others were with seeing it.", "score": 27, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/w3b75j/what_i_learned_from_attending_a_bachelorette/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/w3b75j/what_i_learned_from_attending_a_bachelorette/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

As a person who prefers solitude, it's great to find a place like this.", "selftext": "To write my story so far would be very long and confusing.  Needless to say, there are probably some essentials to know:  I'm in my mid-40's, I grew up very introverted, shy, whatever people called it.  Only ever had a handful of friends at most because it was hard work figuring it all out.  Not really interested in relationships but tried to go along with it in my teens.  Failed.  Went through my 20's and into my 30's without any close relationships, minimal friendships.  Ended up marrying someone at 32, we don't have kids (biological reasons) - and we're happy with that.  Got diagnosed with ADHD last year, made a lot of sense of things that have happened in my life as well.\n\nI'm a somewhat sociable person - I am a nice, civil person to the people I need to be.  If people ask me for things/advice/just say hello, I'll return that in kind.  Simple conversations that are to the point, but not being brusque about it.\n\nI don't mind being in a place where it's busy because I am anonymous.  I used to love going to the nearby cities, doing some personal shopping, all with this deep sense of comfort that I was on my own, doing my own thing and nobody around me made any difference.  Having a lunch in a restaurant, watching the world go by.  It was great.  Spending time out and doing photography for my pleasure without anyone else is just sublime too - finding an isolated spot to take pictures of wildlife, insects, plants is a particular specialty and joy to me.\n\nI'm fine with talking to my clients for work, doing my job, being at home.  My only friend is online, from a different country too.  We get on well, and it's sporadic too - so it's not like we're bothering each other every day or whatever.  I like that.  We just pick up a conversation from where we left it days/weeks/months ago.\n\nI've often had to face criticisms from people I know for being a solitary person - it was antisocial, it wasn't right, I should be \"fixed\", etc.  To be perfectly frank, I should have told them to fuck off because the joy I have in my moments of solitude, doing my own thing, being my own person is immeasurably more satisfying than the social things they offered. Things they did were full of uncertainty, things I didn't like (and sometimes had to endure).\n\nThe huge difference came when learning about the difference between alone/lonely.  I'd often conflated the two together, but there's a strong distinction to me: I am often alone (even in my work), but I'm not lonely.  I struggled with loneliness for years, until learning that the loneliness was caused by me believing the expectations of societal \"norms\" that we MUST be social creatures, we MUST have friends, we MUST be outward looking for these things.  It's harder in a culture where social interactions are considered a must in order to 'progress' through life, to be successful, better off, etc.  \n\nI just don't.  There's no need for me to do so.  Online friendships, even the superficial ones through comment threads are enough.  Speaking to a client is enough.  Small conversations with my wife are enough.  80-90% of my waking hours are on my own, my thoughts, ideas, things I do - all in solitude.  And it's bliss.\n\nThe solitude of making oneself isolated from society at large isn't one I really 'gel' with, but my place in society is just being someone who floats through it, part of the populace, but also no-one at the same time.  I'm content with my place in this.  \n\nI am content with my solitude.", "score": 58, "num_comments": 10, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/sgzkrw/interesting_to_find_this_subreddit_as_a_person/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/sgzkrw/interesting_to_find_this_subreddit_as_a_person/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Water was nice and warm, a little hot spring.  Fuck, this is heaven.  I'm now farther away from town, which is fine with me.

Equating them is as nonsensical as thinking a butterfly is an airplane. Yes they both fly, but that is where the similarities stop. Yes Solitude and loneness share in the sensation of being alone, in any of the 4 body’s. Those commonly being referred to as the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual shards of the soul, but that is the extent of their similarities.\n\nSolitude is so so much more than loneliness. It’s a cascading sense of calm and fulfillment, it’s as close to enlightenment as the human race can get. The bliss of true solitude is far grater then any high. It’s true that with a drug or sex or success high you become elevated, but that elevation lacks the sense of what’s both below and above. With solitude you stand atop a mighty tower and can see precisely what you have risen above, and more importantly you can see there is nothing above you.\n\nLoneliness is personified by cracks in that mighty towers foundation. Some can never move past those cracks, like the light Shining thought them somehow diminishes the brightness seen only from atop that tower. That’s not to say those cracks are necessary, and its true that the closer to true solitude you get the less frequent they become. \n\nSome have summarized this train of thought by claiming that solitude and loneliest are the same, with your mindset being the only differentiating factor. They would you believe that if your mindset is positive then solitude will arise, and that solitude is a good thing in moderation. but if your mindset is negative, then loneness will follow, and that loneness is always bad. This philosophy is dependent the assumption that all people WANT something to do with one another. That people can only see themselves in the shadows of their peers. That’s not to assume in order to experience Solitude you must remove all earthy contact with those peers, that's almost as idiotic as original comparison between Solitude and loneliness. With loneness you long for some kind of meaningful connection, you want, and in some cases need that. Or at the very least the illusion of that. Whereas with solitude those connections are irrelevant, your existence is not negatively or positively impacted by something so completely out of your control. \n\nWhile loneliness is not some kind of steppingstone to solitude, many if not most people see it that way. They see solitude as just making the most of loneliness, and not what it truly is. I suspect this is due to society’s relative unacceptance towards solitude. I can write 100 thousand words on that subject alone, but It boils down to this. Solitude by definition requires a removal from society, and if you are removed then people can’t compare themselves to you. Some of those souls can’t even entertain why someone would willing do that. Most of those people need society in order to tell them they are “right” or “wrong” or if they are “winning” or “losing”. Without that they lose their sense of self and without there sense of self they have nothing. They are nothing. And as such they view those that have escaped the chains they cling to as, at best nothing.

In other words, a shaman is a man who has undergone solitariness. He has gone away into the forest to find out who he really is, because it’s very difficult to find that out while you’re with other people, and the reason is that other people are busy all the time telling you who you are, in many many ways, by the laws they impose on you, by the behavior ruts they set on you, by the things they tell you, by the fact that they always call you by your name, and by the fact that when you live among people you have to be in a state of ceaseless chatter.\n\nBut if you want to find out who you are before your father and mother conceived you, who you really are, you almost have to go off by yourself. You go into the forest, and stop talking, and even stop thinking words, and be absolutely alone, and listen to the great silences.\" - Alan Watts\n\nAnyway, I'm interested in trip plans and techniques for seeking temporary, constructive isolation.

I graduated from one of the top art colleges in the world 2 years ago but one thing I absolutely hated was the need for open studio work, peer to peer and group learning. It was all very extrovert. During my degree I tried to drop out twice because it all became too stressful and I had a couple of breakdowns. I took a year out before my final year and felt revitalised, only to return and feel upset, inadequate and quite suicidal. I got through the final year, and actually came top of my class, winning every award, even a couple of very prestigious ones. \n\nThis was completely unexpected but it gave me the confidence to think that maybe I have something valuable to offer and I could succeed in life being my introverted authentic self. I've spent the majority of my educational life very unhappy. Tutors would call me lazy and unmotivated because I would prefer to work on my own or work from home, quoting things like \"the best students come in and work amongst their peers in a studio environment\" which did a lot of damage to my self confidence. The way that I was taught also wasn't right for me. They would put a very heavy emphasis on a particular style or method, and whilst I appreciated that, I also wanted and needed space to develop my own style of art, but because we had to work in an open environment (the teachers were constantly on the prowl critiquing and because of the reputation of the college, students were very competitive and bitchy) I felt very self conscious about making mistakes or working authentically.\n\nFast forward 2 years...When I graduated I moved back home, all I wanted was to rent a small artist studio where I could be free to work and explore my ideas, no tutors, no bitchy pretentious art students, no ridiculous tight deadlines, no one telling me to do it this way, do it that way, NOTHING! I had dreamt of this for years, I so wanted to make work I was happy to stand by and wasn't forced or made to someone else's taste. I found a space. But, I fell in love with the landlord of that space and we've been in a mostly very happy relationship for over a year. \n\nThe problem is, he's a distraction amongst other things. He is such a lovely man, but he is so hedonistic and extrovertits affecting me. He wants to go on holiday every month, have party people round for dinner every night, work 2 days a week and spend the rest of the time drinking and rolling around in bed, whereas i'm quite conscientious and i love working and spending time alone (I used to party extremely hard in my early 20's but i've realised there are more meaningful things to do with my time and money!)  I'm not working as intensely as i used to and its making me so sad because I finally got through art school, did unexpectedly well, now this! \n\nWhat is really hurting me is that he keeps giving me unwanted advice on my art work. I have a few projects i would like to get started on, but I would like to work on them privately and take my time and explore it to its fullest, but he is always in my room. He wonders why I work so slowly on things but I absolutely hate that criticism because it's MY project and i've been bruised by these comments from my art school days. Now im starting to feel this pressure to produce artworks at a pace that again, suits everyone else and not me. I mentioned i wanted to have a body of work that I was happy with and I'm aiming roughly for spring 2020 to make my next move, maybe to Rome or Berlin but there maybe a few things i'd like to  learn in london first, and he's took that idea and its turned into \"we're moving to Berlin in April, and I don't think you should explore blah blah in London, you should get a job in Berlin\" and all the other bits of unwanted advice. Now i feel like he's implementing my idea in his way, and if lets say i change my mind or I decide to move the deadline, then I'm \"working too slow\" etc\n\nWe were out a few nights ago and his friend who is lovely but a bit of an adrenaline junkie started having a go at me and asking me why I had completed certain projects and why aren't I producing anything. Even though it felt like a small comment, i've felt upset about it for days because again, it's MY project, MY pace and its made me feel like theres something inherently wrong with me. I wouldn't dream of telling someone how they should or shouldnt work, especially if I didn't know anything about their subject/industry. Now the whole thing is tainted because I now know that he talks about this very touchy issue with his friend.\n\nI've always dreamt of working in solitude for these kind of reasons.  I want the freedom of being able to work in a way I'm happy with. Maybe I'm just a hyper sensitive introvert? I also can't deal with people constantly phoning and texting me and invitations for small talk, then they take it personally if i dont message back straight away. It's almost like asking/implying that you'd like to be left alone is too much to ask for, or its such a weird thing to want.\n\nI need space. I'd love to just live on a remote island where I can go about my daily activities/wants/goals without being disturbed or interfered with. How can i tell everyone to bugger off without upsetting them? Any advice (since I asked for it haha) would be appreciated.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/ci53lx/how_do_i_create_a_world_of_solitude_particularly/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solitude/comments/ci53lx/how_do_i_create_a_world_of_solitude_particularly/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}
