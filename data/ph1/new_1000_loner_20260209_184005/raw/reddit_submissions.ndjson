How attractive your face is, how tall you are, your race or ethnicity, your socioeconomic status, the way you dress and how you present yourself, your sex, the way you talk, etc\n\nWith any social group there will inevitably be a social hierarchy present with these things playing a factor in how people interact with you and perceive you. These things affect your position in the hierarchy.\n\nI never desired a social life or a relationship because I don’t like the idea of being dependent on others for happiness and having to cater to their needs. I put myself first. I’ve been self isolated for years now with my sole human connection being through the internet or the couple of times I leave my house a year. I don’t own pets. I work from home and order things to my house. I have hobbies that bring me more fulfillment than a social life would.\n\nI just don’t like having to put up with the games people play. People idealize relationships (friendship/romance) with others to be magical, but if you are disadvantaged in some way (short, ugly, autistic, etc) then you know how brutal people can be, even if they’re your “friends”\n\n*It’s like being ugly and short, but people in your friend group constantly make you the butt of the joke but you put up with it because you* ***need*** *friends.*\n\nEven if you are advantaged (attractive, tall, wealthy, popular, talented) people can still harbor a bitter jealousy towards you and may try to undermine you. They judge you harshly for the things you can’t control.\n\nObviously I’m not someone who is energized by socializing, it always brought me exhaustion and brutal frustration because I’m not ”normal.”\n\n* Now I don’t have to watch what I say so I don’t offend others (people are sensitive to brutal honesty)\n* I don’t have to keep track of xyz and whatever mainstream bullshit everyone else follows so I can have conversations  (can’t be too quiet and aloof)\n* I don’t have to be worried about expressing a dissenting opinion (the whole group will gang up on you and potentially outcast you)\n* I don’t feel pressured to talk (again, can’t be too quiet)\n* I don’t have to feel pressured into doing things I don’t want to do\n\nThe list goes on. Enjoying my own company frees me from all the bullshit that people put up with because they don’t want to be lonely. I do my own thing now.

There's no worse fate for the average human being than to be put all alone themselves with zero contact, or have zero connections whatsoever (family, friends, partners, etc). Many studies have proven the negative mental and even physical effects of isolation, social or physical; short term or prolonged. (Effects I have yet to experience for myself personally). \n\nWhen dealing with other people I usually leave at the first sign of conflict because I'm just so used to the peace and serenity of isolation, even if I like them. People are willing to put up with a bunch of crap when dealing with others and their flaws because either A: they like people enough to put up with the crap, or B: they hate being alone, or C: a combination of both, but not me. \n\nI like my solitude more than a lot of things in life. I don't even own pets. I finally realized the way I experience it, it just really is that pleasant. When the mortals say things like \"being alone will make you depressed,\" I immediately remind myself of the amount of dogshit they're willing to put up with in others just because they don't want to be alone. It's laughable and even pitiable. Personally, I see love as a weakness for this reason. The mortals fall in love, go through a bunch of horseshit in the relationship, even STDs, and fallout, and the cycle repeats.\n\nIf they manage to find that everlasting Disney fairytale romantic/platonic connection they're all looking for, and maintain it in spite of any follies endured, then hats off to them. I choose to love myself. \n\nSome people aren't THAT bad. I just like solitude. It's pleasant for me and miserable for everyone else. It's the closest thing to perfection. I'm not putting up with anyone's flaws or bad habits. Relationships are positive for the regular person but alone is already a positive for me. That's just the way it is. I'm not lonely. The interpersonal conflict they experience is offset by the deep bonds they form (which usually don't last anyway). I don't care about deep bonds because I like my *flawless* solitude more.\n\nIn truth, my arrogance is in response to theirs. In their eyes, I'm a loser because I don't have any friends. I'm a loser because I don't have a partner. I'm a loser because I never want to go out socializing. I'm even more of a loser for not having any kids; the ultimate form of success for the biologically brainwashed and hardwired sheep devoid of free will. They see me alone (the worst fate) and confuse me with one of those sad, needy, desperate souls at r/lonely.\n\nThey are alone because they cannot find people or people don't want them, and as result, suffer from loneliness. I am alone because I don't care about people and like being alone. We are not the same.\n\nIt's unfortunate indeed that the peace of solitude is known only to a lucky few, rather than be a universal part of the human experience. Many of the greatest and most influential human beings had an affinity for isolation. To have TRULY transcended the nature of men (not deluding yourself to cope with being alone); to not experience loneliness but the serenity of solitude; to have no emotional need for others thanks to complete happiness within yourself; to achieve mastery over your craft thanks to your ability to be alone and practice, is divine.", "score": 18, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/upudwq/loner_arrogance/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/upudwq/loner_arrogance/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

The thing started when i  had 2 years left of high schools, that verbal bullying started to dig deep inside my consciuos mind and even after days weeks i still had that pain deep down my subconscious mind, some of those terrible moments from the past still haunt me, i never responded back since i don't like to treat others the way i don't like to be treated, some of my \"friends\"(not all of them but most of them) even started to make me feel worthless and used  the same stupid jokes over and over again even if they saw i was not happy with the way they treated me they kept doing it, not as much as the assholes that started it all but they did, I even once wanted to kill myself because i was destroyed, i always said why i was born this way, but didn't do it because my family has always been really great and supportive towards me(although i haven't told them most of the things that i'm writing here) and i didn't want them to carry that pain of my lost. By the time that bullying started to hurt me in the long term, i started to be more introvert and started to develop social anxiety, i didn't want to be part of a big social group although i was/am still part of some, didn't want to be friends with other people so i didn't try to find new friends because i am afraid those friends will do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still friends with my highschool and middleschool friends, they don't make any offensive things to me no more in 99.999% of the times(at least not where i'm around), but i don't  see them now as friends and i'm just talking to them because i have to, i  have to because i don't want to be seen as a jackass or an asshole for abandoning them and talking to them feel more like a chore rather than something i want to do, we've been friends for more than a decade(We're 6-7 counting myself).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time the pandemic started, i spent 3-4 months without speaking to nobody except family members, those months were the best months since the pandemic  i was in peace and was not worry about anything, i even  found my passion in programming and started to learn to code, i was a  productive person in those moments and feel really healthy although i was not doing any exercise, i also started to sleep better, after those 3-4 months passed and i reunited again with my \"friends\" i've been feeling miserable most of the time i interact with them, i just want them to dissapear from my life, after reviewing myself, i think  that i want to leave everything from my past(except family) and see what the future have for me, but for now i am enjoying my alone time and i'm considering to become a temporary loner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to distance myself from them, but sometimes i feel guilty and not only that, they make me feel guilty for interacting less and less with them, I'm in a group chat with the 2 i'm closest with but yesterday they added 2 of the other 3-4 guys even though i explained them in the past i'm happy to be in a chat group with just 3 people max, i don't know if they found out i am starting to change but they still like my past version but i am no longer that version of myself, and they want me to be someone i don't want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in conclusion: I'm a person that wants to forget his past and pretty much start his social life from scratch in the future, planning on becoming a loner for now, What should i do?

I've tried to help those who I found endearing and special to me, but I was always left with the same answer. \"No, you don't understand\" and other stuff around that line. This has happened maybe 5-6 times now and I think due to this response and I guess us falling apart, I've lost a lot of friends. One instance I tried to help someone who was in financially debt. They were living in our friends living room $2000+ in debt, doesn't want to get a job, and had just spent $100 on a game called Valorant. I approached them saying \"hey I questing and am concerned about your spending habits.\" and their response was \"well you get everything for free, I get nothing\". Shortly after word spread around that I was manipulating them and so I left.   I had really liked this person, and I honestly thought that our friendship would have lasted a lifetime tbh. I told them pretty much everything about my last online group to which I was also close with someone who would give me a \"no, you don't understand\". I thought I had made it clear that I hope and wish that this wouldn't ever happen again, but it did. This happened in a span of 4 months.  \nI guess coming back to 3/24/2022, one of my remaining friends and someone who is dear to me, invited me to a past friend's birthday party. My past friend, they were stubborn to say the least, but I really cherished our time together. She was struggling with mental health issues and I said and done all I could to help them, and when I gave constructive criticism  (If I recall I said \"why do you keep using people to your own benefit\" she was pretty manipulative, but not to me for some reason??)  It fell to deaf ears and they lashed out at me and basically blocked me everywhere.        \nMy point is, I feel like every time I become close to someone I end up hurting them. Im introverted and confident in my abilities, so I would be completely fine on my own. Should I be a loner going forward?", "score": 4, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/tnbnue/should_i_avoid_people_flat_out/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/tnbnue/should_i_avoid_people_flat_out/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Its quite ironic, i used to joke around with my friends about having reddit but here i am,, idt anybody gives a crap but wtv\nSo ive been an introverted and dependent person for the whole of my life but i guess ive gotten lucky because ive always been in the company of friends.

The average person doesn't like being alone, and even the average introvert probably isn't a \"loner\" and still wants an ounce of social connection. I'm not one of those people. I don't give a FUCK about social interaction, and frankly, I like my passions/hobbies more. I don't care for friends or a romantic/sexual partner. Perhaps you are like this too. \n\nHow do you deal with the demonization of being alone? It makes sense from a normal person's perspective. They NEED connection, intimacy, closeness, and social interaction in general. Being without those things is the worst thing in the world, and from their perspective, LONERS are without the things THEY need. \n\nBut the irony is that most of the bullshit they'll ever put up with in life will come DIRECTLY from their relationships. All thanks to their inability to be alone, their insatiable need for sex and intimacy, etc. They live their lives relationship by relationship because being alone is so unbearable. They put up with toxic partners and friends because for them, that's better than being alone. Their inability to be alone is a WEAKNESS. They go through so much conflict in their lives all because there's nothing worse for them than being alone, and the worst part, they want you to do the same because they see you alone! \n\nBut when you enjoy being alone, it's a whole different story. You don't try so hard to conform because you're confident in the fact you can walk alone without going crazy. You don't NEED a tribe. You don't NEED a romantic partner and so you'll never experience heartbreak or having your life ruined by someone you thought loved you. \n\nTo some people even going through all that is better than being alone. I often find myself questioning my own reality when I hear things like \"You're dying alone!\" \"You're alone like a loser!\" \"You don't have any friends!\" \"Why are you still single?\" \"It's not good to be alone!\" \n\nEven though I have no problem being alone, the fact that everyone else hates being alone sometimes convinces me that there is something wrong with being alone. I even get insecure about it because you see it fucking everywhere. The one with no friends, no partner, literally zero social connection, by choice or by fate, is a LOSER.\n\nThen I quickly remember that they only feel that way because of their NEEDS. How about you?

I so go to movies and run. \n\nI don't think I'm a forced loner!\n\nThere are a lot of people, probably teens, on the web that protests a  lot of how amazing it is to be alone because people are stupid and don't know how to value genuine people. I'm not like that, I don't think like that. I wasn't really forced into becoming a loner, yet I don't remember ever not being a loner - apart from as a kid.\n\nMy sister isn't a loner, she has friends and on and she said I was brave in going for runs alone, she'd never do it, it feels strange. I'm exactly like that with going to restaurants alone, I had immense anxiety when I first went to a museum, or the cinema alone but now I feel at home in those spaces.

I am a loner because I'm sick of everyone's ignorance.\n\nHere's my story.\n\nI cherish my own space. Even as a kid, I preferred staying in my room playing video games rather than playing with the kids outside. Introvertism is in my blood, through and through. I also know I am not the stereotypical black man, and somehow, people do not know how to embrace that.\n\nI grew up in a catholic school. I was the only black kid in my class from kindergarten through 6th grade. What do you do when you are in that situation? You naturally adapt to your environment. I guess that's where my personality came into fruition. Of course, though the perspective of a child, I didn't quite understand how I was different, but my family always made a point for me to never forget that in their efforts to keep me sheltered. When I got to 7th grade I switched into a public school and had a culture shock because I never seen so many other minorities in one place. Personalities are very much different. Image that -  having a culture shock by your own race. \n\nMe, being an introvert, did the best I could to try and readapt to this new environment but I knew I was different so I stayed to myself. It was more comfortable that way. Throughout the rest of my time in school I made friends here and there. Never had issues finding a place to sit at lunch but I wasn't the type of person people would invite after school to hang out. I was just that guy people knew and that's it. I was too different for people to get to know on a deeper level. That kind of bothered me, but at the same time I never felt desperate for a social life at the time. When you're the kid who was never close to anyone, but somehow people felt comfortable to gossip about everyone else around you, it was odd. It was like being a fly on the wall. I never cared to have friends such as that. I preferred being alone.\n\nFast forward to today. I recently moved to a new city for a job. I work from home (thank God) and because of that I'm more secluded than ever. I'm trying to find some sort of social life but people don't know how to interact with me, whether because I'm not the stereotype or my personality doesn't fit what they see externally. I'm here writing this now because I've realized that people are so comfortable with the norm, that they don't have any desire to get to know something that is different. Society is so quick to label someone as \"weird\" or a \"loner\" when they don't fit the stereotype thats floating in their head, but they have yet to deem themselves as being problematic for following whatever role society has placed on them in to be accepted. I refuse to change who I am for the acceptance of others.\n\nI do have one good friend from my catholic school days. We communicate by text but he is so self-centered that I can only take him in doses. It's like he disregards anything I tell him in favor for his own life so I kept communication with him to a minimum for my own mental health. Other than that, my social life remains inexistent. Nowadays social media is what's dominant, but I'm not a fan. Its just an outlet for people to brag and over exaggerate their lives for likes. I only post sparingly because I realized that if you're not active on social media, you are easily forgotten about. I make the occasional life update post and go. \n\nI have thought about the possibility on vlogging on YouTube. I need some sort of social output and vlogging seems like a good way since I can control it 100% and throw it into the void of the internet.\n\n I don't want to deal with people's BS in order to build a friendship, or even a relationship for that matter. I just want a genuine connection with another person who actually...cares. But as I'm getting older, I'm realizing that its rare to find so for now I will stick to myself since that is where I am truly at peace.", "score": 26, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/p4z4ws/i_just_need_to_vent/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/p4z4ws/i_just_need_to_vent/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

By third grade or so three or four females would sit with me (male). Middle of fourth grade social anxiety bothered me so much I convinced Mom to homeschool me.\n\nThis was days before my 10th Birthday. I stayed mostly a loner for the next four years. Then, decided to go to public High School. Made it two weeks of the block schedule. Then, went back to homeschooling. \n\nThroughout my teen years I tried church youth groups, hanging with neighbor kids after school. Nothing stuck. I graduated a private Home School program. \nAfter that I went to College out of State. Living in the dorm there was some forced socializing. But, I was always a fifth wheel or invited by someone who knew I'd otherwise be alone. A year of that I returned home.\n\nI had a job at a pizza shop within days of returning home. There were usually three or four guys smoking weed on breaks. So, I was the lookout in case Corporate or a customer showed up. I went to a few work parties, but topped my run and coke off with coke so not to be drunk. I still just watched the the party from the corner of the room.\n\nFast Forward twenty years, it's just my wife son and me. Mom is close and my two siblings talk fairly often.  My wife is a loner too. She raises our son and is close to her dad and a couple of aunts.\n\nI'd honestly prefer staying home with the kiddo and dogs than grab coffee with a guy I've known twenty nine years.

And I barely message either.  No hard feelings. It's just that those two are social people. Social to the extent that there's back stabbing in their  circles.

{"id": "oi0c12", "subreddit": "loner", "created_utc": 1625990022, "author": "No_Motor7526", "title": "random thinking", "selftext": "Honestly, I’m slowly processing how lonely it is, driving myself to become a working artist. Now, it’s not only that content is king, but can it span across various platforms. With technology making it easier to create, at some point, the artist would have to offer something more than one form of art. Recently, I have had issues with the site reddit. Where it can draw a lot of traffic to whatever you’re doing. My posts for my YouTube links aren’t getting the traffic it once provided. During the course, I got one account suspended. Remembering an old account, knowing my posts aren’t reaching as many people, I went onto that reddit account. Forgot about the banon the subreddit, reddit crossed-reference & ended up banning that account. Trying to create new ones, building up my new reddit account. I was caught out for karma farming. This lasts for weeks. It’s not french toast. During this time. The similar issue with Facebook. Posts getting registered as ‘spam’. Which is still in play. Finally working on accounts that aren't getting banned on reddit. I’m starting to worry that the posts aren’t reaching the same amount of people. I don’t think art itself requires anything. I’m sure anyone can create art around other people, so that connection is in play. I know there are people who kinda crave that isolation. But reading academic literature, the character is a learned thing, like culture in a country. But having a baseline character is an inherent thing in being alive. Personally, I’m very much alone. Though people have, it’s never constant. I can’t remember the last time I got a phone call from someone to say hello. I’m not hip to any cool scene. My anxiety has something to do, a term I accidentally arrived to, is resting bitch face, which is commonly used for women. I do a lot of ‘art’ alone. A large portion of filmmaking is alone. For me at least. Writing it out, any pre-production of it, editing & marketing, marketing is what I started this off. Everything besides the filming of it. I’m sure later in life what I will regret will become clearer in time. But having said that about technology, it’s becoming easier for anyone to become a working artist. Which makes the journey to any success harder & more lonely. I don’t even know why I am writing this. It’s for the sake of it & no clear idea on it’s direction. \n\nHonestly, never against anyone’s stupidity & learn in youth. That your beliefs will always outperform your actions. Recently, I am wanting more of a life work balance. For insecurity, vain, what-not. I have been gaining weight. I’m actually quite pale. To which has been a constant. But the weight goes back & forth. Art has almost overtaken my life. Since I don't have a lot of friends, to any friend I do have, we don’t talk or hang out much. Which I will regret quite strongly. Art is a good supplement for it. It’s productive, meaningful, it is work, contributes to people's lives, like if I am thankful for someone, I can write them a poem, it’s cultured & so on. The lockdown laws has amplified this loner thing. YouTube has allowed a space for that. I’m not so in touch with other platforms, I’m so there is a loner thing elsewhere. What I do with my time, is what I value is where I’m getting at. The excuse of ‘working’ is an excuse for me. A detrimental flaw that I have, it’s easier for me to go & create art. There’s no rejection in me creating art. \n\nNot looking after one's health is a common price to pay. All too common, it seems to be normal, I think it's sad. Maybe it’s the search for that elusive high status thing. My other professional background is in food. Which does not help my weight issues. I think the traits of the human flaw will rise & always continue to do so in the narrative of human stories. I am not less than you, but I don’t want to be better than you. I should meditate more on my own relation to that high status thing, the reasons of vain I have with my weight. If you’re aware of flaws. You know you’re gonna screw up at some point. Life goes on regardless. Despite not looking at their weekly programs, I still watch wrestling, don’t know why I wrote that though it’s a nice filler. Writing anything weekly for this ‘essay’ or thoughts I’ve dropped off. I did it for a number of various reasons, take this how you want, to which I should expand on, I was with a girl who seemed to be attracted to my intelligence so I wanted to act on. I do enjoy writing. But, hey. It takes time to mature, but a process of living to accept a day to day growth thing. This is the first writing piece I’ve purposely sat down in an attempt to write in awhile. I’m trying to break the habit again. Next time I hope to leave myself enough space to write more & more of a moment or subject thing. But now, it is what it is. Not much, just a stream of thought. Which for a while, a stream wanting to be more of narrative. Which is an artform in itself.", "score": 14, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/oi0c12/random_thinking/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/oi0c12/random_thinking/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I am just gonna come here and rant a bit because I am feeling a bit stressed.\n\nI (M16) have always been a bit struggled with friends. My family tends to move a lot due to low funds, and the times I do get to stay somewhere, other circumstances split me up from people I start becoming friends with. Every single year since kindergarten I have lost my best friend from either class separation, them moving, or myself moving. Around 6th grade, I gave up on making friends but still made them anyway without much effort. Even with that, they still left every year. Around this time I also started getting really involved online. I met some really toxic people just so I could have some people to talk to, but they almost have \"ruined\" me if I had to describe the situation. Nearly their entire lives revolved around monetary income and assets, which my family doesn't have much of. They would tend to not address me without some sort of making fun of my money or my looks. Now its hard to live my life without constantly thinking about how wealthy or attractive I look, and I hate it. All it does is hurt me making friends in the real, which is hard either way with COVID. Idk, it just seems like the world is working so hard against me and it would be impossible to overcome it. All I want is just someone to depend on or talk to on occasion, but it feels like that will never happen since my circumstances have made me such a narcissistic, self-loathing, uncaring, and boring individual.", "score": 12, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/nynlp8/toxic_friends_for_when_the_good_friends_never_stay/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/nynlp8/toxic_friends_for_when_the_good_friends_never_stay/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I live alone, spend maximum time alone and only converse with people online with whom I have no commitments whatsoever. I am a loner with low key friends, acquaintances and parents but everybody IRL can see that I am a loner. \n\n\nABOUT MY PAST\n\nSo I would write a bit about my teenage years, how I was perpetually sad (existential crisis, you might say) and got over it pretty much permanently I'm sure. \n\nI was in 11th grade and realised I just don't see eye to eye on most things with other people because well I was different. Yeah it's a mystery it took me that long to realise it, probably because making friends was easy but getting close to them emotionally was a whole another thing. I have been bullied as a child though so a typical loner in the making from the very beginning. And yet I would always find other people to hang out with. And then one day I realised that I talk to people to hide my discomfort from being with myself. And I remember standing in the school playground alone, almost in the middle, feeling very awkward because everyone were happily gossiping but me. I felt the discomfort being in my own skin but I took the decision to become comfortable with me instead of talking to these people who are superficial and different than me. \n\n\nGETTING INTO SPIRITUALITY\n\nSo I searched about strategies for becoming a fully functional loner and stumbled upon the website called www.lonerwolf.com (I'm not getting paid to post this website address LOL I've been previously accused of promoting the Notion app when my post was actually about productivity). So this website was about spiritual methods and I was looking for something else but I went along. Meditation and especially mindfulness (the ones that Buddhists do, the most important skill) allowed me to see beauty everywhere in this world and I realised people are a very small part of this universe and there's beauty everywhere \n\nAnd then I read Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle which totally made blissfulness arise in me for eternity, in eternity. I also got into this book completely unexpectedly. I asked someone to give me a book that'll enhance my observation power like Sherlock Holmes and they gave me this. \n\n\nMY FAVORITE MOMENTS IN LIFE\n\nThey were not when I achieved something anymore. There was no me. Those were the times when I was lost in the woods near my college. I felt like I was better conversing with trees than people.:) It was observing moon at night that gave me chills and I could never get bored of the wonder of the world when you put your head out of the nonsense that society has created. And yet I also found beauty in the architecture of skyscrapers when I was walking alone at night in the streets of Chicago or when I was playing the beautiful open world games or when I was experiencing the books that made me experience joy and empathy. \n\nThese things are magic. And loners are at an advantage because they can truly experience it beyond the noise that results in meeting of more than a human. \n\nWhat more ? Living a fulfilling life experiencing beauty gave me an inner inexplicable confidence that made me talk with full confidence when I came in contact with people. Why ? Because I had learnt to be comfortable under my own skin.:)\n\n\nMY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE\n\nI don't plan. But I'd love to live alone in a city where I have books and games and I earn as a result of my ideas and not as a result of my time. So that I can be a loner in the truest sense so that I don't have to commit to any company or anything of the sort. I mean it's great to have other people from time to time but people come with their own sets of expectations and requirements for committing.

It's a mixture of events that transpired - some 'randoms' mocked me online and made youtube videos about me which I discovered to be two friends that I thought were close because we'd never really had any 'full conflicts' like the others in the friendship group. When I found out I confronted them, two of them began to punch me in a half-jokey way, but I knew it was my time to get the hell out.\n\nWell, I did. Then my school was placed on lockdown and now, a few months later, it's my time to head back to my school. Though, my only anxiety I have is that I'm going to be alone now. I'm in a school where everybody knows everybody and I'm essentially acquaintances with most people, though just not friends - mostly because we respect one another but don't have really anything in common. I only have a year and a bit until I graduate and go off to college (I'm in Britain) so I can't bring myself to focus on making any new friends.\n\nMy problem is, a lot of my acquaintances often remark when I'm alone and ask me where my usual group of friends are. I don't want to explain anything to them as to not rehash old stuff so I am unsure how to respond. Plus, my year/grade are all kept in the same small chunk of school (as per corona restrictions) so my usual hang out spot will have many people in it who'll notice I'm alone.\n\nHow do I divert attention away from myself yet still be alone so I can just do my own thing?", "score": 11, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/lu1z6z/tips_on_being_a_stereotypical_high_school_loner/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/lu1z6z/tips_on_being_a_stereotypical_high_school_loner/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I am 24 years of age, male, and a college student. I was born overseas on an army airfield base in Wurzburg, Germany; I am Black and Korean. I moved to NJ and I grew up as an only child and was raised by my grandparents, mother, and aunt. My grandmother is originally from South Korea while my grandfather is black and originally from Louisiana. My father was absent all my childhood for various \"unknown\" reasons. Until recently, I heard through my half-brother in New York, he's had a history of broken marriages as well as verbal/physical abuse. For the most part, my childhood was positive. As far as my socio-economic class, I come from an average and lower middle class family. My mother commuted to New York daily while my grandparents took care of me. I was extremely close to my grandfather and because of his military experience, he encouraged and exposed me to traveling the world at a young age. In my neighborhood, school, and town; however, I was practically a social outcast and I was bullied severely because of my cultural/racial differences and the fact I was extremely quiet. I know it's a cliche, but my experiences were from it and their scars both physically and verbally had traumatized me to this day. For instance, occasionally I would have to escape to the bathroom for lunch so I could avoid people judging me eat Korean food. My story was far from typical and there was no point of reference or alternative culture I could turn to. I was an outcast to all the outcasts in my town and school because my cultural identity was so unique and my personality was so odd. I had also suffered from a number of learning disorders and I struggled in school and I was forced into smaller resource classrooms with the same group of kids from elementary school to high school. It was painfully exhausting and monotonous and I never received proper help or treatment and I am not playing the victim or race card, my experiences were deeply rooted in my identity and things I had no control over. Typically, you hear similar stories like mine broadcasted in famous literature, films, and television series classic troubled loner, but it's almost always the white boy. I hate to be that way but I am being honest, none of my experiences of being an outcast were superficial or cool or it was deeply complex and very very isolating and insular. Fast forward, I was expelled from middle school for brining a knife twice to school. I had no intentions to murder anyone but I will be honest do not judge me, I was sincerely angry about it and I wanted to protect myself from the bullies I experienced at school. However, the school misdiagnosed me with with a number of disorders like aspergers and I was arrested and I am not going to explain in depth what happened and who was involved just a lot kids bullying me and being surrounded by two-faced manipulative friends, but it led to an immense misundestanding. Peers perceived me and joked that I was classic serial killer or whatever loner type and I was far from that. My truth was overturned by stereotypes, racist, negative remarks, and hyper-exaggerations.\n\nMoving on, high school was well alienating and I practically had no one to turn to until my final year where I met my best friend who helped. He was also extremely alienated and he exposed to different forms of music/art like My Bloody Valentine, Jean-Michel-Basquait, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Can, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, Deerhunter, and Animal Collective. We made music as a passion and we both were the only ones in our town that listen to this music. This is not important in the whole context of who I am, but it is still important to address. Anyway moving to college, was not better people often say that to people like me. I was extremely sheltered my entire adolescence I was not part of any group in school any group whatsoever and I was so sheltered and involved in my own world of my music, writing, and my problems that I was so detached from the beginnings of social media and internet culture that reigned all my adolescence. I had no experience of it and I still don't really understand social media or meme culture or this new vernacular, I was not involved in anything NOTHING. This caused me to live in a cloud of deep disassociation from my peers for years. College was extremely traumatizing this marked the beginning of endless spiral to bottomless sea four years and currently now. I withdrew from college my second year to be brief I went to school in New York. Sometimes I slept on the street and roamed on subways for hours and never returned to class. My roommate alienated me my second year and I was forced to sleep in the basement of my dorm sometimes. I also had panic attacks in public in the city and I can just say I rolled in the middle of a busy street and screamed helplessly for someone to help me and car almost ran over my head. That's how bad it was. I can name more darker experiences where I broke windows in the city too and attacked cars. I was forced on a medical leave of absence. Since the year of 2016 I have struggled immensely and I had return to my hometown and I have basically been there since for the most part. I have been in a long distance relationships and I have knew someone who died to heroin in this town. I hate it there everyhting has been fueled by negative experienences. My mother also got married and forced me to live with my step dad in a new home. I am torn between both places and I am also just feeling deeply alienated and since home I did some of those things in New York back in my hometown. thankfully though the only positive elements have come through therapy and passing and failing community college multiple times. I also had traumatic experiences during two summers in two different states where I interned. The most vivid expeirence I had was when I was slept in the fields of Iowa and behind a church in the middle of nowhere at night. I was feeling so disassociated I just escaped I had put on makeup and romaed on the highway drunk as fuck and I failed my summer internship. A lot other shit has happened too. Thankfully though, I finally got accepted to a college and on my way to get a degree but it's terrible to know how much has happened to me and where I am now.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/lmdxov/extreme_outcast_and_ostracized_in_every_possible/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/lmdxov/extreme_outcast_and_ostracized_in_every_possible/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

{"id": "g3taib", "subreddit": "loner", "created_utc": 1587237713, "author": "djv91", "title": "No one knows I was a loner", "selftext": "Quarantine has me doing a lot of self-reflecting and I just feel like getting stuff off my chest. \n\nBy no one, I mostly mean my family and the few people who I’m very close with. I say “was” because I’m remembering a time period in my life from middle to high school where I had absolutely no friends and nobody to talk to. I am 28 now and would still consider myself quite a loner; I don’t have any actual friends that I talk to or hang out with and my family are really the only people I talk to every day. The difference between then and now is that it has become less painful and doesn’t bother me as much anymore. Only when I remember certain memories is when it hurts and brings tears to my eyes. \n\nI’ve always been an extremely shy person with pretty bad social anxiety so it made me a really quiet person. Throughout my entire middle school years, I never ate lunch so I normally sat alone on the benches waiting for the lunch hour to be over. I did have one or two people that I could say were my friends but they had other groups of friends who I didn’t know well so often times I would feel like an outcast being there. I continued being alone and it felt really embarrassing so I often tried to look busy “trying to do homework” or read a book and choose the furthest emptiest table when possible. I remember we had this woman as our lunch proctor who eventually started talking to me and basically became like a friend. We’ll call her Mrs. Jean. Occasionally she would spend whatever remained of the lunch hour with me once all the students left the eating area for the playing field and we just talked about anything. She had a son attending the same school who was a year younger than me and although she introduced us to each other, I never expected a friendship to blossom because I was so awkward and he was quite an extrovert type. One day though while I was sitting alone, Mrs. Jean brought over her son and three of his friends (girls) to talk to me and keep me company. Bless her heart, I know she did it with good intention but I felt so mortified and embarrassed that I just started crying in front of all of them. I ran to the girls restroom and I don’t remember anything after that. I don’t know what it was, I think it just felt like a pity party for me and I was so ashamed that they must’ve been forced to come talk to me. I felt really sorry for them and myself that the situation had to happen like that. I don’t know how to explain it but as a loner, I didn’t want anyone to know I was a loner although it must’ve been pretty obvious. It could be that I was in denial of how I had no friends because deep down inside I know I was such a sweet and genuine person. If I was to make friends, I would want it to be in the most sincere way not because someone felt bad for me. \n\nThere was another incident during middle school. It must’ve been 8th grade because students were being offered a field trip to Disneyland and whoever wanted to go just had to sign up. I had someone who I considered a friend and we talked about going together. I was very concerned about being alone so I made sure that I knew she was indeed going before I signed up. She had other friends too who I didn’t know if they were going or not but I figured for Disneyland, it’d be best to stay with a group anyways if they did go. On the day of the field trip, I was very excited because if I remember correctly, it would be my first time going to Disneyland. The teacher was rounding up the students to leave to the bus and I noticed that my friend wasn’t coming. I asked her what’s up and she said that she decided not to go. So without telling me beforehand, my fear of being alone became reality and I was shuttled off to Disneyland. It was an entire day trip from 8am-5pm or so. So yeah, I basically spent a good 6-7 hours alone at the “happiest place on earth”. I wasn’t happy, I was sad and ashamed. I would try to hide whenever I saw another group of students and I had a cellphone at the time so I tried to look busy on it, a lot. I don’t know why I just didn’t sit in one place or find one of the adult chaperones to stick with but it was fear of being caught a loner and not wanting anyone to feel bad for me. I remember I stuck around in one of the Disney stores for a couple of hours and they probably thought I was up to no good so I left. I did cry. Got home at the end of the day, my dad picks me up and asks me how it went and I told him I had a lot of fun. \n\nHigh school wasn’t as bad. I grew up a little, met new people and made a few friends but I still really didn’t have a group. I don’t know how yours guys’ high school was but ours had 1st and 2nd lunches; so according to your schedule you’d end up in one of the 2 lunches. If my few friends were in a different lunch hour than me then I was pretty much a loner therefore I spent a lot of time in the library. The librarians must’ve been tired of seeing me nearly every day. My older sister and I attended high school together but she was 2 years older and had a good group of friends who were very sweet to me. If we did end up in the same lunch hour then I would stay with them sometimes but a lot of times I didn’t want my sister to feel like she still had to take care of me so I’d still end up in the library. If she ever asked about my friends I’d tell her they were all in the other lunch hour and she never probed it more. \n\nAll my life, my extreme shyness was just something I could not overcome and I’d say it caused me to be very socially awkward and have bad social anxiety. Either I didn’t talk or I’d start talking and end up trying too hard that my conversations were just messy. Therefore I avoided getting to know people as best as I could. I was more comfortable once in college because everyone really just did their own thing and kept to themselves so I didn’t have to try and make friends or talk to to people if I didn’t need to. It was also a time where I came to really know myself and understand the type of person that I am. The experiences that I went through really shaped me to be strong in a sense that if I had no friends, I would be fine because I’ve went through it many times before and I’m still here. Does it make me sad ? Absolutely but I don’t let it break me. As mentioned, I am 28 now. Still very shy, social skills have gotten much better as I matured and I still don’t have friends but I have my family, a loving boyfriend, and that’s pretty much all I’m grateful for. \n\nOne thing I know is that being a loner made me realize I wanted to be there for others. It was hard for me to get to know people in real life but I found solace in meeting people online because no one had to know that. I was able to be the genuine and caring person I know that I am, offering myself as someone who is there when you just want someone talk to to- being the one friend I wish I had growing up. It made me really treasure conversations with people. I hate small talk, I want to hear about your life and talk about the stars to the oceans. Why ? Because I never fully had a chance to show who I was nor allow myself to show who I am. In the end, it was never about wanting friends but rather, being a friend to someone. (I hope that hit different haha)\n\nAnyways, I feel like I went on a tangent towards the end but I just wanted to get all this off my chest. I feel good now. If you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here. Know that you are not alone and please take care of yourself.

So some of the things that characterizes me I believe are: depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo (sct), social anxiety and asd(have diagnosis). I've convinced myself that my version of reality is warped and greatly limited compared to the average person. Dunno, maybe I'm just being delusional. I've completely abandoned my ego because possessing one takes me to a place I like to call the abyss. This basically gives me ignorant suffering. Okay, I'll try to explain this the best I can. Several regions of my brain appear to be inactive and it's always been like this since I've been born. Due to this and the things I've listed before, without sufficient self-awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it. I reject my experience of reality and started considering the possibility of everyone else being soulless except me. The perfect coping mechanism! I can't validate my version of the world or other people's existences. Even as I read your comments, it will literally turn into a feedback loop to be interpreted by my brain. So I pay close attention to my thoughts, feelings, inclinations, ambitions, point of view, emotions and basically reject them. I have this constant need for stimulation(think I may have inattentive adhd), otherwise I get bored, completely empty and start feeling really . Though denying the very core essence of my being requires so much brainpower due to things listed above, and due to poor memory, I start doubting my belief. All I want to do is turn into a recluse and live a life of self-indulgence completely cutting myself off of society for good.\n\nA problem that I often have is falling victim to the flow of others (like a toddler).

I realized at one point the owner / principal was a boule christian ✝️ crazy ass lady who would contradict herself multiple times and lied / mind controlled my parents to believing I had a rebellious spirit. I was awakened to religion at this point and I felt alone then, I knew it was a scam and they paid extra money just so I wouldn’t be educated, but manipulated and so they could run their business hands on instead of hiring people to manage while i would stay after school. I would read encyclopedias and books to fill the empty time or on the computer learning about technology.\n\nFast forward to highschool.. I finally leave after convincing them to let me graduate from a public school, and I realize not only was my education level was behind, my gpa was capped for some reason at 3.3 the whole 3 years I was in highschool. I noticed this in 11th grade which I considered to be a critical point of standardized testing. It infuriated me and anytime I was exclamatory about this with my mom it would turn into a blowout argument and demonization of myself. \n\nI figured at some point I would be find someone to love after being abused and silenced for so long about my life. I did find that, after going through my late teens and early twenties in the street, dropped out of college because I loved making music more lol and for the business degree I was after, I was told many times over every now and then that I could just get certifications. I worked at restuarants, until I found a technical school to go to for an internship opportunity upon competition and inbetween the transition / internship our house went for foreclosure. I stayed with a friend and his mentor for subsidized rent on the Southside of Atlanta. Eventually the internship ended and I graduated..

So I have been a loner by choice for about 7 years now. I always enjoyed being alone with myself for the most part but I think it's starting to wear on me.\n\nAfter high school I didn't do much of anything except hang out with the same two friends drinking and smoking weed. We would usually do it a few times a week and outside of that and work I would spend my time alone. As me and my friends got older we started drifting apart still keeping in contact but I would decline invitations to hanging out with them and if i did I would leave as soon as I could without hurting their feelings. It got to the point where we would just hang out maybe once a month or two. I still played video games with one of them online though. The one I didn't play games with I would go almost a month without talking too but he would always reach out if i hadn't which I did appreciate but it got to the point where we had almost nothing in common so it was hard to talk to him.\n\nFast forward about five years and I'm still friends with those two but I have since moved across the country and the one friend I played games online with doesn't have internet anymore so we don't talk nearly that much and when we do it's not for very long and the other one we just cant seem to talk for longer than like two texts a week or so.\n\nSo now the two friends I had are all but gone and I haven't made a friend in earnest since high school. I had plenty of chances in some of my jobs but liking my alone time I always denied hanging out outside of work. As I'm sure you all know after a while they stopped asking which is what I wanted. But now im pretty much alone. I know I've wanted this but now I feel like I'm missing out on everything life has to offer. I always hear about stories of people going out having fun and I'm jealous. I see all the good co op games coming out that I would like to play but no one to play with and I don't like playing with randos. \n\nI guess what I'm getting at is I regret pushing everyone away so I can be alone. I don't even know how to make friends. Im not very good with conversing and am pretty shy. As I get older I feel like I've missed out on my youth and what's left of it by doing this. Don't get me wrong I still enjoy being a loner to some extent but now I feel like I'm really missing out on life by choosing the loner life and it's starting to effect me.

I just like hanging with family, maybe some friends I’m not rlly close to but other than that🤷‍♂️\n\nThe main reason I’m here is this: \n\nMy friends will make fun of me for “not having a girlfriend” but I’m not rlly trying. I’m a junior in high school and haven’t had an ‘actual’ gf since elementary (ik that’s some real hot stuff) but my personality has changed so much from Jr. High to now \n\n5th grade: first girlfriend, only official girlfriend 😑\n\nJr High me: not many friends, struggling with school\n\n8th Grade: Started finding myself in theatre, Peaked in social skills, hung out with people a lot, was very energetic, cringe mode top tier, (looking back strangely very flamboyant??) Crushed on some girl (looking back she was ugly) got Uber friendzoned.\n\nFreshman: realizing a lot of my friends were toxic and stopped hanging out with them, social, still strangely flamboyant(repressing currently), friends diminishing to small group of nice individuals \n\nFreshman summer: girl who was best friend liked me, didn’t like back( I did kind of but she dated all my friends in my guy group and the relationships lasted like a week each) I friend zoned her and we became distant.\n\nSophomore: finding myself again, had a solid group of guy friends. Growing taller, became less fat, dropped the flamboyance, became a relatively chill guy. Started to focus more on school. \n\nJunior: actually finding myself not liking having out with my friends that much out of school, my best friends starting to become real dicks to me, confused if I should drop them. Focused on school, thinking abt future. Friends make fun of my loner status \n\nIt’s not a great representation but it’s just a depiction of my social life changing. Throughout my life I’ve felt like completely different person than 1 or 2 years ago. I honestly just not interested in dating the gurls at my school at my age, some are cute and nice but I don’t think they’re interested in me and I don’t feel like putting in the effort of ‘wooing’ them if I’m not super crushing on them which I’m not🤷‍♂️. I hate the insult that I’ve not gotten a girlfriend bc 1st off my friends are ugly and they date all the girls in their friend group and haven’t held a gf for more than 6 months. 2nd is that I’ve had opportunities to date people but I’m not interested in the people that like me, looking back I was interested in one girl and idk why I didnt go for her at the time but she moved away anyway so oh well. 3rd is that I’m honestly never been looking since like 8th to freshman grade. I’m just not attracted to the girls in my friend group, like their nice and some are cute but most I’m not super close to, and most of them get annoying.\n\nThat’s my love life status, idk why I felt inclined to post this but that’s my situation, idk what to do I just wanna date someone that likes super nerdy shit, and has a off color sense of humor and for the girls at my school there’s like one girl and my best friend is trying to hook up with her. HUGE RIP(please press F in the comments). But like I feel like I’d be okay being s loner, I’d like to date someone but the options at my school are yikes. \nIf anyone relates that’d be great because I feel like a loner ", "score": 7, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/9zlud9/yeah_i_guess_im_a_loner/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/9zlud9/yeah_i_guess_im_a_loner/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Most of my childhood was lonely, my best friend was my mom basically - and yet I was happy. I was happy playing by myself with my dolls or drawing and doing all sorts of activities by myself at home. Me and my mom used to go to the mall or take short trips, go to the beach etc. As a kid I never felt that I needed a social life.\n\nIn high school I began feeling like a bit of a freak, but only because people around me treated me that way because most of the time I was by myself. I had friends some of the time, but I've never been a part of a close group like most kids. Just random friends that I met in different classes, never been a part of a real \"friend group\" that hung out togethe after school or anything like that.\n\nAnyway, even as a teenager I didn't feel like I was missing out on something by being a loner, but now I'm 27 and I realise that maybe my life could be better if I was more social. \n\nI'm good-looking and I have a nice job, I work out a lot and I like myself and I know that people tend to really like me. For most of my adult life I've been in monogamous relationships and hung out with my boyfriends' friends, they never met any of my friends because I've never really had any. It raised a lot of questions and I think that part of the reason that I haven't been able to find a guy who'll actually want to settle down with me is my lack of friends- as weird as it may sound. I just feel like most guys find me too weird and even if they date me for years and years, they probably keep this thought in the back of their minds and don't want to build a family with someone like me.\n\nAfter my last relationship ended, I was left completely alone. I had a few friends from my last job, but during the depression I've experienced post-breakup I've come to see that these \"friends\" don't really care about me. Since then I haven't been able to build any new friendship, perhaps because I just don't see the point anymore.\n\nEach time I somehow establish a connection with someone, it doesn't last very long because I really don't want to put in the time and effort anymore, after being so disappointed with the friends I had in the past. \n\nI don't seem to connect with people anymore. I don't have a problem being nice or developing a conversation -  I just don't care for it. \n\nI wish I could just feel like I used to feel when I was a kid, when I didn't feel the pressure to have friends. Now I just feel like I'll never get the life I want because no one will want to spend his life with someone who doesn't have friends and thus doesn't go out much etc. At least where I live it seems like a real dealbreaker for guys (always one of the first questions is \"where do you go out with friends?\").", "score": 15, "num_comments": 8, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/loner/comments/90vs4e/i_really_just_dont_like_people_even_though_most/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/loner/comments/90vs4e/i_really_just_dont_like_people_even_though_most/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

This has made me somewhat distant from people in general. \n\nSo I don't know. Does this sound similar to your experience?
