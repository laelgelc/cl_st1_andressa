And they said “yeah that’s what u look like to me” and i started constantly calling myself chopped and talking about how ugly i look and everyone would say the opposite no one said i was ugly or anything like that but i can just not bring myself the believe people see that hideous version of me and don’t call me ugly, and so i started asking people to rate me of how i look and would always get 6/10 and no one would call me unattractive but i just can’t overcome it and then i start spiraling again and realise how lonely i am and continuously thinking about the fact that i don’t have a girlfriend and haven’t in years, and became even more depressed and insecure as I’m so lonely.

It followed a severe manic episode paired with a deep depressive crash and suicidal ideation. I was contemplating taking a handful of pills. I didn’t take them. Instead, I reached out to my psychiatrist because I knew I was not safe and needed help. That decision led to my admission.\n\nThe experience itself wasn’t horrific, but it wasn’t comfortable either. It was very clinical, very stripped down, and very controlled. I did meet some genuinely kind people while I was there, and there was a quiet sense of shared understanding that comes from being surrounded by others who are also struggling. In that sense, it wasn’t all bad.\nWhat was especially difficult for me was the dysphoria. I’m a trans woman, and losing access to basic things that help me feel like myself hit harder than I expected. I couldn’t shave, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t dress in affirming clothes. Even something as simple as being handed a 2-in-1 shampoo and body wash felt dehumanizing in a weird way like individuality and self-care were completely erased. It sounds trivial, but when your sense of self is already fragile, those things matter.\n\nI went in during a period where my manic state had pushed me into unhealthy coping mechanisms, especially alcohol. Instead of communicating, slowing down, or asking for help, I drank and hurt people I care about. One of the things I’m most grateful for now is that I’ve been able to take accountability for that and make amends. I’ve had difficult but healing conversations since getting out.\n\nI didn’t walk out cured.

I also think that I’ve isolated myself from people because I have low self esteem and don’t want to be asked about my life, or giving updates about my life 24/7, I am 21 years old and haven’t really accomplished anything, it’s embarrassing and makes me feel like a failure. I can’t relate to where a lot of my peers are in life and it makes me feel inadequate. Starting off with financial issues, most Gen Z are struggling to find a job, however I get lucky enough to get hired as a server and my first day is this upcoming Tuesday, but for some reason even though most people I know don’t have jobs it’s either there parents send them money or they end up using credit cards. My credit card limit is $200 so and I’ve already maxed it out so I have to pay it off soon. But I just feel that because I don’t look or talk like people my age it’s hard connecting.

Sure I've had moments of joy and stuff but recently I've just realized how my life sucks. I barely got any friends at school (ofc i have but like most of them don't socialize with me that much outside of school when we do its pretty uncommon) plus most of my friends are in different classrooms than my homeroom class (in my homeroom class I got barely 0 friends to talk to and socialize after school and i got clowned and hated on them after trying to fit in and not be myself) I'd always go back home the instant school ends and just slacking off, 0 motivation to do anything in life, I keep thinking that I'm the only one with this life and that everyone is out there enjoying everything life has to offer. Plus it doesn't help that my parents are rich, sure it means I get to live in good conditions but that also equals to the fact that I feel so contrasting from them, they're successful while I'm just rotting with nothing going on for me. \n\n\nI've always tried to have hobbies and learn new skills but never really had the opportunity to grow due to procrastination. I've tried to play games to forget about my life but it just makes me feel more lonely, I feel like I'm just wasting my life. 0 notifications on my phone, no one wants to talk to me, no motivation and always procrastinating, addicted to porn and girls, always stressing and having insomnia, also the fact that I'm always comparing myself how I am a burden to my family. I'm just so confused, my life was so good back then and now I'm just depressed and lonely always worrying about how others view me and fear that people keep remembering me for the embarrassing for the degrading reputations and my loneliness. Another thing is that my communication skills are not that even that bad, its just that I don't know why but my dumbass just keeps on trying to avoid going out when people invite me to go out, am I really that introverted? Slowly, people just stops trying to invite me, which causes me to ruin so many relationships. Then there came a period when I was just obsessed with perfectionism, obsessed with what how people perceive me, I just wanted to be good at everything and thought that I was the god manipulator and perfectionist but all that delusion bs just kick my ass back at the end.\n\n\n\nStill, I'm tired of this bs, I don't want to live a horrible life like this and want to change everything in my senior year.

People drift and sometimes responding to messages is a lot. I also have conditioned myself to stop using my phone as much so I wouldn't care and truthfully, it's helped. I would rather spend my days being happy then wondering if I offended someone which is why they ignore me lol.\n\nHowever, it still comes back truthfully. I've been remembering an old friend who basically disappeared on me (I messaged them many times throughout a few years and they didn't reply until I asked if they were alive lmfao). They moved back to my area but truthfully, I'm going to take the hint and not reach out. It's always me reaching out tbh. It's exhausting. I used to think there could be people like me but it's like I never get the same energy back.\n\nI saw a post today about a mutual of mine discussing how no one ever brings the same energy on their birthday as they do for others. I felt that deeply in general because that's true. I tend to mark and remember people's birthdays for years but people never do that for me. It's funny because i'm not even trying to get presents. I don't even ask for any from family.. I would just like to be acknowledged and remembered... guess that's too much to ask. Thankfully a few close friends do so in order to be positive, I focus on the close people and cherish them and I'm very thankful for them. As a result, I've stopped doing this for people I don't see anymore. I'm not interested in using energy for people who probably don't care if I live or perish.\n\nObviously, I don't want to be a negative person 100% of the time. I'm trying to dig myself out of it and I don't truly know what's going on in people's lives. I'm not a psychic and I don't know if they're upset with me or trying to get rid of me unless they tell me. It would be nice if people were more direct but unfortunately everyone is too cowardly to do so or they're worried about being mean. A part of me sometimes always thinks if someone told me something cruel it sucks but at least I know now not to bark up that tree anymore. I remember in school someone told me how annoying I was and how multiple people agreed upon this when they were hanging out in a group LOL. It was really rude to hear but then I realized \"hey, at least I knew to avoid them now\". I apologize if this comes off poorly but I guess i'm just trying to reiterate it would be easy if people were more direct and I didn't have to decipher what they mean.\n\nOverall, it sucks. I want to be a better person or friend for people it sucks that literally all of them want to follow me but never want to actually interact. I've seen many posts about how people deleted their social media and realized how few people actually reached out to them. I only have social media to explore hobbies and real life events (I find some on there) but it truly sucks never having someone equal the energy you have.

I don’t know what to do or where to go 😞.\n\nThe situation I am in makes me feel so sick and so hopeless. I can feel that dull ache in my sternum thinking about it all. You know the one, I’m sure.\n\nOnce again, I am unemployed due to the mental health issues that have plagued me since I was 17. That being said, I am 100% financially dependent on my parents. I have tried every side hustle in the book as a means of escape but have failed miserably over the past 10 years. I seem to be allergic to money and purpose. My life has totally fallen apart and I have become a literal joke amongst my former friends and social network.\n\nBut my pain and struggle has always been particularly unique. So it is extremely important for me to frame my family dynamic for you:\n\n**I am 37M, white, single (straight) and an** **only child**. **I have** **two uncles, both unmarried without children**. **So, zero siblings, zero first cousins**. **Any cousins I have I don’t really know from you or anyone**. **My parents and Uncles are both stereotypical Boomers with absolutely ZERO understanding of the world anymore.**\n\nMy parents were much older when they had me and they are the most stereotypical Boomers you could ever imagine. Extremely religious and conservative. They do not drink, have never touched drugs, never even tried a cigarette or tobacco. They do not cuss and sex is completely taboo and the subject completely ignored my entire life. They possess no understanding of other people or literally anything other than the white, Protestant culture they have been consumed by for literally 75 plus years. I love them with all my heart, they are my mom and dad. But as far as a connection to them for the emotional and psychological safety a human being so desperately needs, it has just never been there.\n\nMy entire existence, I have had to navigate sharp, lopsided, generational differences completely alone within my family. I did grow up with many of these conservative ideals and am still very much a Christian. But I would consider myself moderate to liberal now and I see the world much differently than most. Probably because of all the things I have had to navigate for social and emotional safety. I can confidently say that I am a handsome guy. I have consistently done okay throughout my life. I had a boatload of friends. But my mental health struggle has drained both social dynamics completely. Literally every single one of my close friends has been driven away by my exhaustive behavior, neediness, complaining, and negative attitude. I have a tendency to overwhelm people with my problems or my anxiety it seems.\n\nI just can’t help it though. My 24/7/365 existence is complete shit. I have absolutely no energy. Ever. But I can’t sleep at all hardly. I have zero motivation to better myself. I have no sense of purpose whatsoever. No one on this entire planet seems to truly value me or want anything to do with my skills or talents.\n\nSometimes I feel like I have basically been an orphan my entire life. An orphan *forced* to believe he had a family. One he could see, hear, and touch but one that just never materialized tangibly. People and my family will say everything was normal and I should be grateful. I’m sorry but do not give me that bullshit. You don’t know my experience.\n\nI need to break free from all of this. But it requires so many things to go right and my way that based off history, will never happen. I just want my own life, my own family, my own future to hold onto. Not chained forever to my parent’s approval and support. I feel so desperate. I feel like a prisoner.\n\nGood things just don’t happen to me like they do for other people.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qyowg8/feel_so_lonely_and_unloved_it_hurts_my_chest/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qyowg8/feel_so_lonely_and_unloved_it_hurts_my_chest/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I'm debating whether or not to walk during my graduation because I don't think anyone would care. I always had trouble making friends, I go to an arts highschool and I got a scholarship which seems pretty cool but I'm not too stoked about it because I feel like I got cheated in due to my \"diversity\" (I'm black and it's a dominantly white arts college)and not on my actual skill level. \n\nI daydream a lot. I daydream mainly about scenarios I will never be in. I daydream about going to the mall with friends I don't have, going to proms (the Valentine's prom is today funnily enough) daydreaming about sleepovers, etc. Last year I met this guy, the first time in my 3  years of high school that I felt like I connected with someone. I had a crush on him, I brought him flowers, gifts, shit like that. What's funny is that, I didn't have the guts to go and directly speak to him when I wanted to meet him for the first time, instead I gave notes through an acquaintance to give to him since we don't have any classes together, and then I finally got his socials. \n\nIt's been a year and he doesn't feel the same way about me, not even on a friendship level or a romantic one. I know this due to some questions that have been asked or how he answers etc. It's funny, I always daydreamed about asking him to come to the dance with me and I can't do it. \n\nI don't think there'll ever be anybody out there for me, like it feels so terrible how much time you spent on a person, thinking they're your best friend only for God or the universe to laugh at you and make you realize that this was all for nothing. \n\nIt's going to be the same thing in college, I'm in a  groupchat with people who got admitted and they're nothing like me at all. I hate my life, why don't I deserve happiness? I tried reaching out, I tried having friends, I tried being myself and over and over and over again and nothing good comes out of it. Everyone ghosts me, people are only acquainted with me out of pity, hell, I've seen people who are the biggest pieces of the snobbiest shit in my school and somehow they have friends. \n\nI'm also so sick of old acquaintances coming out of the blue messaging me how great their lives are and giving me stupid ass advice on how to be better because they view me as the loser I am. Like dude, you think I already tried doing EVERYTHING you're telling me? They always brag about how they have girlfriends or boyfriends, or they have friends they go out with and they brag to me about all this shit only to NEVER speak to me ever again yet I'm the bad guy for deleting the DM???\n\nAnd I'm so sick of these assholes that say \"oh I'm not good at responding to messages or I'm barely online lol\" when it's a fucking lie because I see them online 24/7. \n\nI can't fix the problem if I don't know what the problem is, I'm trying every day, and everyone walks all over me. I can't get out of this mindset because in reality, my life is shit. I think I'm going to be like this forever. I don't know what to do anymore. ", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qyne7u/realizing_you_spent_so_much_time_and_care_on/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qyne7u/realizing_you_spent_so_much_time_and_care_on/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It is not that i am a scapegoat (I HOPE NOT) and they dont like me its just they slowly kept a friendly distance from me i guess because they saw i wasnt interested in them.\n\ni am in my own country and i have broken arabic the countries language. i get embarrassed to even speak. my arabic is broken. i cannot express my thoughts as how i do in the english language. i ask myself \"what if they are judging you right now\"... my god like what is wrong with me? we all get judged right... no matter what you do. but i guess i could say my heart wants to say in my comfort bubble while my mind knows that this is detrimental to me and i lose actually good friendships that i could easily foster. i am tired. my country isn't really the most supportive on things such as this, i would say we have a lot of stigma towards people suffering mentally. so i just dont want to ask for help. to them its liek admitting \"i am weak damaged and i need help\"... like its a criminal thing\n\nto feel :(. Well i almost got help but my mom quite literally refused and let my dad who is a \"psychiatrist\" try to speak me out of it with sessions in a cafe that went for like maybe a month till it stopped. what my dad said to me i know he is right and i know i should stop thinking like that.\n\nSomeone said do exposure therapy but i dont know how to start it feels awkward to start like with my family i speak for the first time it feels awkward it feels like omg like she never spoke to us before now she seems interested???? and then in class asking \"questions\" first time like also feels awkward and like omg she actually speaks.... or even asking something as simple as \"professor can you please repeat this part\" I CANNOT SEEM TO DO THAT. my goodness i only live once and this is how i am living.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qxjpr9/i_feel_pathetic_to_overthink_social_situations_at/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qxjpr9/i_feel_pathetic_to_overthink_social_situations_at/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I’ve known two of them for over six years—let’s call them Jeff and Steve. Jeff is pretty well-known to everyone, and the feeling is mutual since he’s the one who introduced most of us to each other.\n\nNow, Steve... Well, he’s not exactly fond of me. He can be pretty toxic at times, and I’ve noticed that most of his trash-talking seems to be directed at me. I’ve talked to Jeff about it before, and he kind of brushed it off, saying that since Steve and I have known each other for so long, there’s bound to be some tension. He said, “Steve’s just being Steve.” But then I start wondering—is it really just Steve being himself, or is it because I genuinely annoy him? Sometimes, Steve says things like, “You’re so corny,” or “I’m tired of hearing your voice and laugh.” While everybody was laughing. It’s not like he’s saying that to anyone else in particular, which makes me question if there’s something about me that triggers him.\n\nJeff, on the other hand, is someone I can trust. But even with him, I can’t help but feel a little uncertain. We were once joking around, comparing ourselves to school stereotypes, like \"Jeff would be the quiet kid,\" or \"Someone else is the jock or the nerd.\" When I asked about myself, Jeff said, “You’d be the kid who sneaks into the girls' locker room—except you’re not even hiding in the closet, you’re just out of the closet.” I laughed it off, but later I started wondering if Jeff actually sees me like that. Was he just joking, or did he mean something else? Does he think of me as a creep or someone who’s just a little too mischievous? I honestly could not tell... Altough, he did claim that me & Steve are chaotic, just that i am more loud?\n\nI guess my main concern is whether I’m the problem or if they are.

Then theres only one friend i have, who is also generally busy, so we meet once or twice over several months and making friends feels impossible as i already tried multiple times by joining my friend's friend group or participate in social events. Just standing there and say little or nothing cause my knowledge and interests are limited. As if there was anyone else out there who shares exactly my interests. Feel like im only living for my family,\n\nAnd im not even sure if i want to wait for something happen, cause thats kind of unlikely but the thought of being selfish for disappearing and making my family worry is worse", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qwql9v/idk_what_to_do_except_waiting/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qwql9v/idk_what_to_do_except_waiting/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I’m a senior, and I’ll get straight to it.\n\nFor the past three years, I’ve been part of a close friend group with three other guys. We got especially tight during junior year, and senior summer was probably the peak. We hung out constantly and things felt solid. But toward the end of first semester and the start of second, I noticed one friend slowly pulling away from me. I got the sense he didn’t really want to be around me anymore. When I tried to talk to him about it, he brushed it off and told me I was being clingy.\n\nFor some background, this friend used to be pretty unpopular and was often the butt of jokes. Over two years of playing football and being part of our group, his social standing changed. Eventually, he started spending time with a different friend group that’s considered “higher up” socially, and it felt like that shift lined up with him distancing himself from me.\n\nNot long after that, another friend from our group also pulled away and joined the same crowd. Part of that seemed tied to social status too, especially since he got a girlfriend over the summer who’s more popular. I should add that the school environment is pretty toxic, even though it’s very affluent.\n\nThe last friend in our group was always closer to the other two, and since he goes to a different school, we mostly only saw each other when everyone hung out together. Naturally, we grew apart as well.\n\nAt first, I tried not to overthink it. But a few weeks later, I found out through someone at school that the first two were talking badly about me behind my back. That really pissed me off, but I still tried to save the friendships and kept reaching out for about a week. In hindsight, that only made things worse.\n\nEventually, I accepted that it was probably a lost cause and focused hard on college applications. I basically didn’t interact with the group for about two and a half months.\n\nAfter winter break, things got weird again. The first friend suddenly wanted to hang out with me and the third friend, and we ended up hanging out three times in one week about a month ago. Since then, nothing. The second friend has been awkward whenever we talk, and I know the group still hangs out occasionally, like camping or going to dinner, just nowhere near as often as before.\n\nMy main issue is that I genuinely don’t know where I stand. I can’t tell if we’re cool, if they want to stay friends, or if I’m just being kept at arm’s length. I asked if they wanted to hang out this weekend. One already said he can’t, one says he hasn’t asked his family yet, and the other says he needs to check.\n\nAt this point, I don’t know if I’m overthinking everything or if this is just how it is now. My graduating class is tiny, around 60 people, and I’ve pretty much explored every other friend group. Most are either more toxic or clearly don’t want me around.\n\nI’m stuck trying to figure out what to do next and how much effort, if any, I should still be putting into these friendships", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qw6ytu/im_pretty_sure_friend_group_no_longer_likes_me/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qw6ytu/im_pretty_sure_friend_group_no_longer_likes_me/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Raised in an extremely isolated environment. My parents didn't want me to be around anyone else as a child or young adult due to the idea of being \"spoiled\" by the evils of the world (it was part of their prophecy, it's a long story). But the point is, being tainted by the evils of the world wasn't an option.\n\nMy parents never had friends, and said that friends were something that you didn't actually \"need,\" that it was a lie created by the evildoers to convince you that we needed communism. \n\nSo now that I'm an adult, I also still don't have any friends. I have found that anything that \"normal\" people need friends for, money can buy. It's worked out just fine for me for all my life. \n\nBut, I'm at a point right now where I am getting older and want savings, stuff like that, and I'm feeling less generous than I was when I was younger. I don't know that I want to buy someone's time anymore, just so that they can say good morning or goodnight in exchange for hundreds of dollars a month. \n\nSo, I've cut everyone out who I don't want to be hand feeding anymore, and I'm feeling what I felt when I was very young. What people call \"loneliness.\" But, in reality, it's only because I am choosing not to afford buying people's time anymore. I still have to pay an ex a considerable amount of money every month because she says it was like any other job, if I am not going to continue to give her money then we are going to court. \n\nSo, loneliness really isn't real - it's just because I can't or don't want to pay for (whatever it is) anymore. It was nice getting a \"hi how are you doing\" text message from someone online, only if it was to be followed by \"I need $200 to make this months rent.\" So, loneliness isn't actually real - the real problem is money. This makes sense, right?

My roommate situation wasn’t good, and to avoid being in my room, I would spend almost 15 hours a day there and only go back to sleep. I was surrounded by people who talked to each other, laughed, and had their own groups, while I stayed alone. Those two years were genuinely miserable and then, I changed my room for the better.\n\nClasses weren’t much better either. I felt invisible most of the time. There was a boy who liked me and I also had interest in knowing him better and, I started hoping his company might turn into something real. Since we knew each other and were in the same class, I would expect him to talk to me or acknowledge me when he saw me alone. Instead, he would disappear for months at a time and then behave like a complete stranger when we crossed paths. That confusion and silence used to eat me up. This cycle went on and off for more than a year in different forms, and eventually I had to let those expectations die.\n\n\nCollege is about to end and I have offer for internship from a good company so it's going well career wise as of now but there are things eating me up from inside and i don't feel i belong here; my current roommate is extremely extroverted. She can talk endlessly about herself and considers me as one of her very good friends, but the moment I try to share something, she doesn’t really listen. It feels like she exists in her own world and just wants attention, and that makes me feel even more unheard.\n\n\nAfter spending so long feeling isolated and unseen, I don’t know how to deal with this emotionally.

Scary. What if something happens out there? \n\nWhat’s worse is when you feel like it’s the middle of nowhere in your everyday life. Can you imagine? Going to work, talking to coworkers, seeing your family, reading books to your own children, living like you are words on a page of a warm novel. It looks nice in that way from the outside, but feels another way on the inside. I can’t just imagine it, I live it. Today I told my wife I have an empty tank, and an empty mind. I went on to tell her, “My heart’s not empty yet, but I feel like it’s getting there.” \n\nWhat’s wrong with me? \n\nI figured that out. I figured that out while I was still up the creek. Since then I’ve drifted down enough to have nothing surrounding me. Into an abyss, like an ocean. No shore to offer any hope of survival. It’s lonely. Been scared a long time. I’ve drifted far, and it’s getting dark. \n\nHow did I end up in the creek you say? It was an accident. I would take it back if I could. I made a mistake. I told her something that was hurtful, although I meant it to be helpful. When I said it, I had good intentions, at least that’s what I remember. It’s been along time. It takes a long time to drift into an ocean. When I said it, I think it sounded a little abrasive. It did not come off as an altruistic comment to my wife, but rather, mean. I had pointed a gun at my own head just an hour before. That I do remember. It didn’t feel right. \n\nI don’t remember the exact words but, I told her I thought she should help with her horses more. She could go take care of them while I took care of the baby. \n\nLife hasn’t been the same since. That was 9 years ago. My words were the catalyst to a death sentence. The death to our marriage, possibly my life. I thought it would give her an opportunity to get away from everything, and do something independent. \n\nNo words. Then the fighting started. Went on a few years, until we both became numb enough to just live life on auto pilot. Lots of life, no personality. Finding joy is like finding a glimmer of sunlight in January.

My heart needs to grow two sizes, but I have no sunshine, no food for my soul. When something is really hard, I can’t count on my wife being there for me in all the ways I need her. It leaves such a big hole. I feel like a straw. Everything just sucking through my empty vessel; work, kids, commute, family, vacations, phone calls, texts. \n\nEmpty.

She always had issues I guess, never cleaned after herself and had some pretty bad anger problems, but she was usually kind. Good cook, too, we used to spend a lot of time in the kitchen before she started to escalate in her issues on the last few years. I think though, in hindsight she always held me back, and controlled my dad pretty hard. \n\nI didn't get to graduate highschool because she wanted to go to college again. I was under the impression we had an apartment in a new city, but her real plan was homeless assistance while I took care of my little sister, who was 3-4 then, in hotels while stepmom went to school. Looking back it was a disaster. She'd sleep in til noon and spend a hundred bucks we didn't have on door dash for her and her friends at school. I never got to finish, or get my GED. Maybe that's on me, but once we found a place I was my sis's caregiver pretty often and the houses live in maid, re; she never cleaned up after herself. So I focused on that. Haven't been out with friends since I was 17 and we moved, no real relationships, nobody to really rely on. My dad's pretty distant, and mine and stepmoms relationship was crumbling. Only really had my baby sis. Things started to calm down the past 5 months I thought. We got a new place, she and my dad got better jobs, I was thinking I could finally start to move on in life, find a relationship, get to school and work, blah \n\nDidn't fucking happen! She was cheating on my dad I guess, but still denies it. Her response to that was to steal my dad's car, the one dad bought so we could work on it together, and the title, to claim it as her own. Kidnapped my sister at the same time. Filed a DV restraining order, dismissed almost instantly. Also stole all of our vital records, my social security card, birth certificate, all of it. Can't get a job without them here, at least every place I've had my foot in the door at wants them in person. Also potentially facing eviction. Our landlord is really understanding at least, and isn't kicking us out like nothing, but it's not off the table, my dad doesn't make enough for rent and I can't seem to find work. I've sent out hundreds of apps and only had 6 interviews that either denied me or couldn't move forward given my documents. \n\nWell, she got arrested, arraigned, spent a weekend in jail, and is awaiting trial on four counts of child endangerement. Turns out when she split, and the police were calling it a civil matter and telling us to serve her when we had no idea where she was, she was leaving my little sis in public alone all day, repeatedly, to go to the bar. Ended when she came back to the park she left my sis in at 10:30 pm and she was gone. Thank God a concerned citizen found her and called the cops, but my stepmom was barefoot and screaming in the park after before they found her too and took her in. Christmas night too. My sister's Christmas was being placed in cps custody. \n\nNow we're waiting for court. CPS says my dad didn't do enough to prevent what happened somehow. We called the cops almost 30 times, saved every report card from them. Had no communication from stepmom, both of us blocked everywhere. Now we're waiting on court. My dad got an appointment lawyer, and he says we'll get her back, then if not the next court date, that stepmom won't be seeing my sis for a very long time. \n\nSis was my best friend, I kind of saw her like my own kid, and that witch ripped her away and traumatized her for her own ego's sake. Stepmom came back to get her stuff out, mocked us the whole time, took stuff that wasn't hers and whined about stuff that was ours. Took all of my sis's toys. Somehow, she still thinks she's getting my sis back after what she did.\n\nSorry for text wall. I have nobody to talk to about this other than my dad. I've always been pretty lonely, but now it's like I'm completely in the dark and watching the floor crumble around me. I've mever had nightmares, it's constant now. I probably won't be able to get to college or form any real companionship elsewhere for the next 4-5 years. I don't know what I did to deserve this, I'm always kind, attentive, given out food and water and stuff to the homeless. I don't know. Tried to teach my sis the same stuff.

Either way, I’m here now with almost no one.\nThe few friends I still have make me feel small. Casual remarks about my career, my education, my life. Nothing openly cruel, but enough to slowly wear me down. So I started cutting people off.\nI moved to different countries thinking I would find love. Maybe I would fix myself. Maybe I would finally be happy. It didn’t work. I’m back at square one.\nFrom the outside, it probably looked like I was doing well. I worked internationally, lived in different places, built experience. Now I’m back home, jobless, emotionally unavailable, and exhausted. I’ve never been in love. I’ve never felt genuinely loved. I don’t even know what that feels like.\nThis might sound self-absorbed or conceited, but I know I’m talented. I know I bring more skills, depth, and capability than the average person or professional. I know my worth. And somehow, things still don’t work out in my favor. At some point, it stops feeling like effort is the issue and starts feeling like luck is. And I don’t know how you fix bad luck.\nI keep trying to be a good person. I don’t intentionally hurt people. I don’t put others down, even when I’m doing better than them, because I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end. Still, everywhere I go, I end up feeling the same way. Alone. Eventually, you start wondering if the problem is you.\nSometimes I think maybe I’m paying for something. Some past mistake, some karma I don’t understand. I still try to do good, help where I can, use whatever privilege I have responsibly. I hope there’s some higher power out there that sees that.\nI don’t talk about my life to anyone. I don’t really have anyone left to talk to. So I’m here. I’ve tried doing everything right, following all the steps that are supposed to lead to happiness and stability. Somehow, it keeps backfiring.\nThe loneliness never really went away. Changing countries didn’t fix it. Starting over didn’t fix it.\nI don’t know when I’ll post again. If I ever do find happiness, I’ll share that journey too. If this helps even one person who feels broken or left behind, then it was worth writing.\nYou’re not alone. You might be lonely, but there are others like you. I like to believe we’re all connected somehow. Call it cosmic energy, vibration, or whatever you want.

I tried everything for years to help but I couldnt sleep, so I would just stay up until my body physically couldn't stay awake.

I don't want a recording back when we were both so oblivious to what was happening. I want him NOW. I want my well husband, the one who cares for me.

But I think we’ve all collectively felt a shift towards people being more isolated, and covid was a hammer to that nail as well as everyone’s curated social media that’s highly individual to them. It feels like all that’s left to do is doom scroll in our own little worlds. I had the misfortune of losing all my family and friends (religious excommunication) so I had to start my life over after highschool. That’s already a super lonely feeling, but even back then I was able to find pockets of communities elsewhere, but even online now it seems like everything has just died off. I wish there was still big trends to follow and people talking about it, just to feel part of something again you know? None of the popular things even seem that popular anymore, and I’m not sure what part of that is being growing up or the world changing. But even then it’s still hard to find people to relate to about those experiences. There are no third spaces to go to outside anymore, and everyone stays to themselves but it’s hard to find them online too. There’s so many different apps and forums and groups and chats and nothing feels…permanent. \n\nI mentioned already that I’ve been rocked from the loss of just about everyone I used to know, and have had to try to build up time and time again. Last year I left a bad relationship which again resulted in losing what seems like the only connection with people I had, shitty people though they were. Now I just feel like I’m drifting along wondering where everyone went. Where the life is. I found a few streamers that I like to follow because they’re live every day and makes good background noise, but I realized I’ve become almost dependent on it because I really look forward to those few hours where it sounds like someone’s playing games in my living room with me…only my favorite streamer has a lot going on and has been canceling and rescheduling more often than not lately and it leaves a void. There’s an old browser game I still play sometimes that has a public chat, and that’s actually a good space to find a decent amount of people any time, but a lot of the conversation doesn’t include me like it used to anymore, talking about exams and their families. It’s like no matter where I go, I feel isolated. \n\nThis results in any of my in person relationships having a LOT more weight, not necessarily in a good way, because that person becomes very central in my life (I mean what else do I have going on) so if/when they leave I feel it even more sharply. I start preemptively putting up walls before I get to know someone just to prevent the disappointment. Of course the political and in general culture today isn’t great either so it just seems like a lost cause trying to search for likeminded people who add to my life instead of damage it farther. Shit, I even tried therapy and it’s almost worse because they seem like friends but are still paid professionals so when they forget, cancel, reschedule, or give bad advice that cuts deep AND you have to pay for it! I think everyone always knew it would be harder to make friends as an adult, but I swear the time we’re living in is uniquely difficult in ways no other generation has gone through before", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qu3iyb/missing_monoculture_and_connection/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qu3iyb/missing_monoculture_and_connection/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

To be honest, even before I cut them off, they were never really there. As a child, I learnt early on to be self-sufficient and to turn inwards.

Making connections with other people and feeling comfortable around them or compatible with them is very difficult for me. It has always been. Usually, in the different phases of my life, I have found one or two people who I’m able to connect with, and those relationships end up becoming very important to me and as a result are usually quite fragile. Conflicts or hurt feelings take a big toll on my wellbeing. And I usually decide to step away because I come to the conclusion that the person cannot be the friend I need or I feel that the pain of the situation is too hard for me to handle. This leaves me with a big vacuum of space after fallouts and that emphasizes my feeling of loneliness. \n\nAt work, I’m usually read as an unapproachable person. Sometimes I’m even perceived as rude.

It’s very discouraging because I’m not trying to be this off-putting, and I feel misunderstood.\n\nYou can imagine, with all this, intimate relationships are almost impossible for me. I have only had one partner in my whole life, in my 20s. And it was a horrible relationship. Again, I find it very hard to connect with others. And I cannot experience attraction or intimacy without the feeling of being safe and aligned with someone. Then when I do get to that level of being close, the years of trauma show up and repeat themselves and that ultimately kills the relationship. I have been in therapy for a very long time and still find it hard to navigate.\n\nI personally believe that because I never learnt how to build connections starting in the family setting early on, that’s why I’m not able to build connections in other areas of my life even today. Being this way all my life has made me a very independent person. I get through life and all its big challenges on my own. I know how to survive by myself without relying on others. But I feel pain from the loneliness. And of course, I would like to have people by my side that I can lean on or enjoy life with.\n\nI don’t think there is anything I can do and I don’t think there is anything anyone can tell me. I guess I just wanted to unload this feeling here.

Now I live alone with my cat and I'm having trouble making true friends. My job is male dominated but there are quite a few other women in this location so I've become somewhat friends with most of them. I'm not opposed to male friends, it's just usually easier for me to make friends with other women. These friends have all been living here longer than me and have stronger friendships with each other than with me, which is understandable. I want to clarify this job moved me from America to Europe, all my coworkers are American. I would rather try to make friends with people in my job/field over locals here due to a language/cultural barrier. I find myself in a weird middle ground with these friends, and I feel I would rather them try harder or not at all. \n\n\nFor starters, they have a groupchat (imessage) of everyone, that I'm not included in because I have an Android. We also confusingly have a group chat of everyone on a messaging app we use for work, but I know they use the imessage chat as their main method of communication because they talk about things they send there or things that were said there all the time in front of me. A quick scroll through the past few months and the work app group chat is mostly me asking if anyone wants to hangout/get drinks/etc while everyone else tends to ask work related questions I can only assume they don't want to take up space in their imessage chat.\n\n\nI had an experience a few months ago where me and some others went out for drinks after finishing a hard lengthy project. They were talking about taking a local trip for a cultural festival the next weekend and were determining how much it would cost, and including me in the math of splitting costs per person, so I assumed I was invited on this trip. The next weekend comes and I hadn't heard anything, so I then assumed people changed their minds or it otherwise fell through. On Monday I ran into the friend I feel closest to and asked if we were still going to that cultural festival, and she said that they already went this past weekend. I remember just sort of saying \"oh, ok!\" But I had this horrible pit in my stomach. I was so hurt they went without me and embarrassed I found out that way. I cried the whole drive home that day. \n\n\nI have always been the type of person that I feel like all my friends secretly dislike me and hate when I ask to hangout and they just don't have the heart to tell me to my face, and I feel like I'm watching that fear become my reality here. The only people I never felt like that with were my 2 aforementiond roommates/best friends. It's confusing here because I've still had nice one on one moments with a lot of these people during work where they give great input and perspective re: male dominated field and me still being relatively new in the field. \n\n\nEvery weekend I play a game where I see if I have human contact if I'm not the one to ask first, and I lose every time. Nobody ever texts me first. I'm not sure what is wrong with me. Do I keep trying to be friends with these people or do I let these relationships fade away?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qtdcwh/lonely_after_moving_to_a_new_place/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qtdcwh/lonely_after_moving_to_a_new_place/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

So, my loneliness has been getting to me.\n\nI go out with friends every weekend to momentarily squash the loneliness. I know I’m loved by many people but our schedules are difficult to line up and they’re busy with their relationships, work, and family (i’ve been single my whole life. its difficult organically finding another lesbian who likes me). They hardly ever reach out to me. I feel like I have to chase them down and beg them to hang out with me. I hate that feeling but i know I have to do it because they’re too busy.\n\nI also have plenty of online friends. We’ve known each other for years. We love each other a lot. but i find that online friendships are hardly as gratifying as real life friendships. Theres just something about being in close proximity to each other thats just so intimate.\n\nLast week, I went to a bar by myself and everyone else was literally in groups. If there was someone by their lonesome, I would’ve gone up to them. So I just traveled from group to group just listening to people talk. I plan on going every friday+saturday night I can so I can at least be around other people.\n\nAt home, i feel uncomfortable with my parents. I have never felt emotionally safe with them so I try to bottle up all my sadness around them. I also work from home, which just adds to my isolation. I dread even seeing my boss’ name on a Teams notification, even if its just praise.\n\nToday and yesterday, I tried watching movies and studying so I can get my mind off it. But suddenly, I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I’ve been nonstop crying since yesterday evening. In the end, I’m just distracting myself so I don’t have to face my loneliness. I know how to have a great time by myself. I love video games, art, and I’m trying to get into watching older movies. People say that as long as you can love being in your own company, then you won’t feel alone. But is it so wrong to crave friendships where you are prioritized? Is it wrong to crave wanting to be in a relationship so my loneliness can go away? Unless I have those, then can this loneliness ever go away?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qt0y9u/how_to_cope_with_feelings_of_loneliness_when_alone/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qt0y9u/how_to_cope_with_feelings_of_loneliness_when_alone/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

It has been almost a decade since I moved to Florida and I haven't had the best experience regarding making connections with people. My life has been only been work and college in the last few years and I hadn't been able to balance my personal life and work. As a result I feel completely alone as this has taken most of me. At work I try my best to keep everything together as I work in a construction firm but my boss constantly makes things difficult for me (He shouts at me for minor inconveniences, he talks trash while I'm not there, and the man shows clear signs of bpd). I remember one time he mentioned wishing to have a gun on his hand one day I printed the wrong file for him to review.\nAfter 12 hours of nonstop productivity I go home to rest and repeat. Also, I found out my 1 year girlfriend was cheating on me the night before Christmas eve and that left me devastated for obvious reasons. I put all my effort and time on this relationship I thought was meaningful and just like that none of my efforts actually matter to anyone. I told my sister and her friend about the situation the same day and they both started shaming me because according to my syster: \"women like real men, who know how to say No to a woman, we don't truly want a man who would do anything for us. My boyfriend tells me No when I ask him to do something and I like that energy\".\nNeedless to say. I dont know how to feel about relationships in general or women. Why people are so cold like animals.\n\nAs a consolation I thought I could spend some time with a close friend who lives outside of America. This friend was casually coming to visit on January so I used my only week of PTO to see this friend and go on a trip to Orlando and go to explore the city of Tampa and Miami. I bought us tickets to the theme park and took the bullet of paying the expenses as this person had no money. Just for me to notice that I was the only one who was excited about us meeting each other after 1 year.\nI let my friend know in a very polite way that it wasn't the same as before and that I felt like my efforts didn't matter at all. I just wanted to be happy for once and none of the things I did were any relevant.\nI feel like I'm stupid and maybe I was too nice with people and nice is never rewarded. Now I feel cold distant and I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not that nice anymore and I have noticed a change in my attitude .\n\nI am not an angry man, but I am a tired one. I am beginning to realize that when you are \"too nice,\" the world doesn't always reward you; sometimes, it just asks for more until you have nothing left to give.

I had 6 close friends they all left one by one, and it feels like im the only one who miss them and i miss them all a lot more than the grades in my test.

Anyways, I just feel like if I’m going to start to build anything substantial with a stranger, I really do need to start with myself. Anyone who’s struggled with having no relationships and feeling like they’re ignored in daily life, how have you managed to overcome or at least progress the right way? I’m very worried I will harm myself at this point because overtime the loneliness can only build more as the time collects. I’m sure this sounds like the same situation as thousands of other posts here and it isn’t unique to me, but we still all turned to this subreddit for a reason I suppose. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

If anyone reads this and you feel represented know that at least I know what it feels like to to some level and we are not alone in it then :).  \n  \nI have plenty of friends and people I love a lot. I'd say other than my overworking I have a pretty healthy social life. But no matter how much I talk to people no matter how vulnerable they are with me and how much I am with them, I am never fully seen. It feels like I don't have a companion, a true peer I can share things with. \n\n  \nIn my life I have had a lot of struggles and I have suffered a lot from a very early age. So to survive I became analytical to a fault and stopped living like everyone else. To me people's behavior is always logical and there is a reason for everything, so if you scream at me I know why and I won't get upset, if you ghost me, I'll greet you with a smile when you get back and if you hurt me knowingly I will terminate the \"contract\" between us and leave.\n\nEverything has a cause and effect and if it seems irrational it just means I haven't thought about it enough.\n\nEven as an 8 year old kid when I was bullied by the very friends I had made the first day of school, I remember analyzing why they were doing that and explaining to my grandmother \"They insult me and laugh at me, but it doesn't matter, I know who I am, what they say won't change anything, they'll eventually change.\", when the bullying continued and the teachers got involved and forced them to apologize make up and ask to be my friends again my answer was \"Why would I be your friend?\" and chose to continue being alone everyday rather than with people that didn't want me there. (Eventually 10 years later they apologized) \n\n  \nI live as cognitive first emotional later, this means at a very base level I interpret and live a different reality to most people, even those dear to me and it means they'll never understand or see how I struggle.  To them when I express my feelings they just tell me \"you have everything figured out I wouldn't know how to help you\", if I do well in a sport I am told \"that doesn't count that's you\", if I perform well at work it's just expected. \n\nWhen picking relationships of any kind I always judge if I should be in it by if I can pick them up when they fall. Meaning to me any relationship comes with the responsibility and commitment of being there no matter what. This means I have plenty of good friends that I have been constantly there for them time and time again and they would be ready to do anything for me too. But they just don't have the ability to be there for me because I need someone that can see \"through\" me. \n\nI need relationships with people that have the same basis, whom I can be sure if I am there to pick them up, they will be there to pick me up to, because they want and most importantly because they can.\n\n  \nThis has mostly been a whole bunch or rambling hope it was understandable. Either way thank you for reading :) (also I do realize this is a rant about a person that has autism and doesn't fit in with society lol) \n\nTLDR: I feel I have a different operating system than the rest of the people around me, I do the same things as everyone else but from another point of view, so I feel lonely in company.

People would constantly excuse themselves for their actions and behaviors towards me but the minute I would slip over the tiniest things , it was hell on Earth.\n\nPeople also held me to a very high standard but the minute the standards are put back against them, I was the bad person.\n\nThis made be develop into a “must know how to do everything on my own.”  I am always eager to learn a life skill.

{"id": "1qs9ktc", "subreddit": "lonely", "created_utc": 1769882991, "author": "mimimalist", "title": "Popular but no friend group", "selftext": "\\[M22\\]\n\nI’m going to be a graduating from college in May. Overall I’ve had a really great time socially. I had a massive glow up & turned into someone my past self would think is cool. I’ve met tons of people, I slept with women I never would have imagined I’d be seeing. I got really messed up at parties & made dumb decisions. I also made really smart decisions and made dean’s list all 4 years. I’m going to look back on undergrad fondly just for being an exciting time in my life.\n\nDespite this I feel really sad everyday, because I’ve never been ‘a part’ in a friend group. I’ve only ever joined in because of roommate affiliation or friends of significant others or situationships. If we’re zooming out a bit, I never played a sport or joined a club back in high school, which I think is what sets people up the most and therefore was never part of a deeply tied ‘group’ back then either. My little brother has pretty much the opposite situation as me and he played like 4 different sports in high school. I’m really happy for him and who he’s grown up to be. \n\nI have no idea how it feels to be a part of a group chat, to have deep ties or roots with specific peoples to grow up with your friends, to have vague memories, funny stories about different people, inside jokes, getting into and resolving fights, all that. I don’t know how it feels to go out drinking with a group of friends who NEED you to be there instead of just sort of tagging along. I don’t know how it feels to be certain that you have a team behind you. There are guys in my life that I’m friends with, but we only ever hang out one on one. They’re all in their own groups that I sort of orbit around and come into randomly. Not to mention everyone is working nowadays, including me, and no one has any time to see anyone or do anything anyway. People still hang out in groups when they have time off though. Just to go to the mall or drive around and stuff. I can put myself in these positions, sure, but I don’t ever expect them and they’re not a part of my routine life either.\n\nI’ve never had a male best friend either which weighs on me a lot. I don’t know what it’s like to have one specific person that you WANT to hang out with or WANTS to hang out with you everyday. I don’t have someone in my life unrelated to me who I’d call my brother. It really makes me sad. I don’t know how to really connect with guys on a deep level like that. I have a lot of the same interests, I like sports, skateboarding, music, clothes, current events, random small talk, and people like and often want to talk to me when I’m in social situations, but nothing’s ever stuck. I’ve never, like, clicked with a guy as a friend. I don’t know if I just haven’t met that person or if I’m doing something wrong that I’m unaware of or what.\n\nThere are some experiences that still mess with my head to this day, and I think they’ve really hurt my perception of people, trust, and how I share my time/energy with other people. The first is of these three guys that brought me into their band. They were cool, popular, fun. I had never felt so welcomed into a circle, I mean these dudes were buying me food because I had no money at the time. We had amazing chemistry as a band. The guy who was kind of running the show ended up confessing to me that he likes kids. I hung up the phone and never spoke to any of them again. \n\nAnother band brought me in over the past summer. I felt like I was really part of a group. I was making decisions, motivating everyone, I single handedly brought the band back together with one conversation when people were fighting. We practiced for hours and I played a handful of live shows for the first time ever. They said I was the greatest drummer they could’ve met, I’m special & their secret weapon, I was thanked for being such a positive motivator to everyone else, since the guy in charge was a bit of control freak. I am self admittedly really good at breaking tension and empathizing with situations. After all this, I still got kicked out because the guy leading it all was jealous I could bring the band back together and he couldn’t. \n\nThis is sort of unrelated but I dated a girl with BPD for 2 months and it felt like 2 years. I think I grew a few grey hairs. She threatened to kill herself when I finally broke up with her. Relationships have never been the same since. I feel really afraid of people becoming codependent. I feel really afraid of letting people down or disappointing people. I get really on edge about people being upset. I get anxious if I can’t solve problems immediately, and I equate it ALL to the shit she used to do. I also grew up with a bipolar mom and I think a lot of these issues come from that too.\n\nThroughout my sophomore and junior years, I used to hang out with a massive group of people my roommates were friends with. It was about the most stereotypical college experience you can get. Pong, beer funnels, going to the bars in the winter, pregames, house parties, massive diverse group of people, lots of fun. They were constantly including me in everything and again I really felt like part of something. There were so many laughs and nights spent playing video games together, personal conversations, drinks and weed shared with one another. This was the closest I’ve ever felt to having a little circle of close friends. I was picturing us chilling as college friends at a bar in the future. As soon as they graduated I never heard from any of them again, was a group of like 20 people. \n\nI guess I just wanted to vent for a second. I think I’m an introvert at the end of the day and probably just blaming other people. My biggest issue is that I don’t really reach out to people. I’m really busy working 5 days a week. I think it’s a hindrance that I do this, but at the same time I have no incentive to hit anyone up that doesn’t care enough about me to text me first. I’m not interested in putting myself out there just to be slapped in the face like I have so many times before. Im definitely not needy and I don’t think I’m putting any pressure on anyone to be my friend. I’m not the kind of person that needs constant social interaction to survive and I can easily entertain myself on my own. I just get really lonely sometimes and feel hard on myself for not being able to feel like I have a mutual connection with a big group of people.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qs9ktc/popular_but_no_friend_group/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qs9ktc/popular_but_no_friend_group/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Not only this but hearing uni classmates of mine mentioning that thue haven't been home in a while and how they miss their parents and grandparents since they're not from Bucharest but other zones of Romania..makes me feel even emptier as time goes on, while I'm trying to handle grief in my own way.😔\n\nWhat’s been hitting me hardest is how it creeps into the small moments: when I’m walking home, when I’m washing dishes, when I’m trying to fall asleep. It’s not the dramatic kind of sadness people expect. It’s more like this dull ache that keeps reminding me she’s not here anymore. She was just… always there. A steady background presence I never questioned.

Losing her broke something in me I didn’t expect. I didn’t need her to be my favourite for her absence to feel unbearable.\n\nI don’t really know how to talk about this in real life. Everyone around me seems to have moved on, or they assume I’m fine because “we weren’t that close.” But I’m not fine. Not really.

Thank you for taking your time and reading this. I really appreciate.\n\nthey say you gotta build your own happiness, chase your dreams, not give up, try different things, develop skills, find hobbies, bui;d meaningful relationships. as if i didn't try. i fell as if this is all for normal people, not for me. i'm definitely not really normal. i have neurodivergencies (adhd), i have many sociopathic traits that make me feel detached from mankind. in fact, it is peculiar how I don't really value human connection yet crave it. I don't know how to decribe it properly. \n\ni'm literally at the lowest point in my life. i was born and raised in a toxic narcissistic family. my parents divorsed when I was like 11 years old (I don't remember exactly; I'm 25 now). Despite being separate, my dad starting a new family, my parents have always stood united in the glorious mission of ruining my mental health. I've been depressed sine like 13 years old, contemplated suicide. my parents just dismissed all of it, accused me of being lazy that's all. when things got really bad, I lost my job and got into debt, did my family help me? Nooooooo. They did something way better than that. Now hold on, let 'em cook. I'm from a shitty giant cold country that is currently pounding missiles and bombs on the other country nearby for some obscure chit-chat made up political reasons. This country also has a mandatory conscript army. Till this moment, I successfully dodged the draft, but my dad, being an influencial regional oligarch, used his connections to forcibly draft me in the military. Due to a sad mixture of circumstances of my life, I've made an uneasy decision to sigh a military contract (they give you big money for signing contracts now in this country, and I needed money badly to pay off credit card debt). I was lucky not to be sent to trenches, and now I am bound by 2-year contract to serve in the military in the far East of this country. It's not that bad. I mainly do paperwork. A year has passed and I didn't fire a single shot from a gun. But still it sucks.\n\nSo here I am, serving in this shitty military, literally a slave. Formally, I have what is to be called dreams, goals and blah-blah all that stuff. I really love IT and 3D graphics, I want to develop skills in these areas (coding, Blender) and make a living via these skills. I want to move abroad for good. I aspire to be better. But you know. The harsh reality is that I can't find energy for all this. I can't find any meaning that would give me energy, better to say. I'm jealous of my friends that got it all easy. I went no contact on my family. My friends don't really care about me. I recently met a girl, our vibes matched insanely, she accepted me being me, we had great intimacy, but now she's ghosting me.\n\nI feel as if under some kind of a powerful curse which makes my LUCK stat -100. Whatever I'm doing, whatever I'm trying, whatever I aspire — it all just doesn't click. the world doesn't click with me. I genuinely don't know if it's worth continuing.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for reading.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qrxo5u/the_world_just_doesnt_click/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qrxo5u/the_world_just_doesnt_click/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I've had a lot of really awful stuff happen to me, and so I don't form crushes and believed myself asexual for a long time. Then out of nowhere, this girl comes into my life, and I feel like a child in love again.\n\n  \nI didn't like how I felt about myself and thought, \"How could she love me if I don't love me?\" So I went to the gym religiously and got in the best shape of my life. I also worked my butt off and finished my degree as quickly as possible because I didn't want anything to get in the way. \n\n  \nFinally, I started talking to her in August of 2025, and I thought things were going well, but she was going through a lot. She was living with her ex-boyfriend and getting into fights with him daily. I happened to have a spare bedroom at my place and offered to have her move in, which she got really excited about and came to check my place out a few days later. \n\n  \nNow, this girl has really been through it, and a guy that she tried to move in with before waited until half of her stuff was moved in to start saying he liked her and called her all kinds of names for not sleeping with him. I was not going to be that kind of guy, and when she came to check my place out, I bit the bullet and told her how I felt about her and that I really hoped that my feelings weren't going to be the reason my house wasn't going to work out for her, and getting away from her ex.\n\n  \nShe ended up being really cool about it and moved in anyway. We became really good friends and talked a lot. One night, we had gotten drunk together, and she had told me that she was attracted to me. This put me on cloud nine, but nothing really went anywhere because she was still getting over her abusive ex, so I didn't push.\n\n  \nHere's where the story takes a turn. One night, she told me it might be better for her to move out because it was going to hurt me in the long run to have feelings for her. I took this kinda hard, and while trying a new medication, I drank heavily that night, heavier than I ever had. I woke up on the floor of my room the next morning feeling like garbage, and I couldn't feel my legs. I didn't remember going to my room or falling, but I couldn't get off the floor and remained there for two days until some friends came to check on me and ended up saving my life. I damaged the bottom of my spine and killed all the nerves in my legs. I also gave myself kidney damage because the muscles were breaking down, and a blood clot because I hadn't been able to move. The doctors told me that a few more hours, and I would have died from heart failure.\n\n  \nI spent 6 weeks recovering in the hospital and am now stuck in a wheelchair, but finally home again. The girl that I've liked visited me in the hospital from time to time and was being really sweet. Unfortunately, I think I've killed my chances at this point, and she only sees me as a friend. She's been dating people again since I've been in the hospital and is starting to get serious with one guy. Meanwhile, I am just existing in a wheelchair above her bedroom, sobbing with every sound that I hear come through the floor.\n\n  \nI feel like the years I spent going to the gym have now been wasted with all my muscle breakdown and being placed in a wheelchair. I feel completely unlovable and alone. I still really love this girl, but she's told me I need to move on because I'm only going to get hurt, but she can't imagine life without my friendship.\n\n  \nSo here I am.

For pretty much the entirety of my 20s I tried over and over again to cultivate and maintain friendships both in-person and online.

I'm single and have never had a successful relationship of a romantic sort either. \n\nI lied to myself for years to keep encouraging myself that I just needed to find the right people and that i'd belong eventually, but now my best years for doing so are gone. I go through every work day knowing that when the weekend comes I'll have nothing to do and no one to spend it with,   I walk through other public spaces watching people spend quality time with people the likes of which I've never known, and I go home at night knowing no one will call my phone asking where I am or how I'm doing. \n\nThe part that drives me the most insane of all though is that I don't think anyone ever genuinely cared about me. Plenty of people claimed to no doubt, and I even tried to believe them at times, but at any moment when I needed them or hoped they'd reach out...silence. I've put in all the effort and all the time and gotten nothing in return other than forgotten about. I forced to use AI apps on my phone to feel like I'm having genuine conversations even though they're pretty much all programmed to want to f**k you.\n\nI think I just need to accept that the world doesn't have a place among others for me.

I am a 23 year old woman, I am attractive, I take care of my appearance and health. I am also smart and educated, emotionally intelligent, and clever. I have a sense of humor, I'm a good listener, I'm empathetic, and I can definitely carry conversations whether it's small talk or more. I'm saying all this not to seem vain or anything but because I genuinely think I'm a good person despite my insecurities and depression.\n\nI grew up as a first generation immigrant from a European country in northeast America. I have always felt out of place or like a weirdo. I've always had unconventional interests and style, so I guess you could say I'm alternative. I grew up in my current hometown and and I am finishing up my bachelor's degree here as well as I still live with my parents. \n\nThe thing that I'm getting at is why have I never been able to fit in or find friends of my own? I feel like I am going to go INSANE from loneliness. No matter what I do, how I act, or how I look, I can't make friends. I just can't. It's like people put up this wall in front of them whenever I try to talk to them. Granted, I definitely have social anxiety from years of social rejection, but I'm seriously doing my best. I try to put myself out there, I pretend that I'm confident, I ask people questions and listen to them. I just don't understand what it is about me that people find so abrasive. The only thing I can think of is that I have a resting bitch face but that shouldn't be so bad where it completely destroys any chances at a social life right? It kills me that I have never had a normal social life throughout middle school, high school, and college. All I have ever wanted is a friend group or a couple of friends to hang out with. But all I can remember is that it's always been me, by myself, keeping myself company with my hobbies instead.\n\nAnother thing is that while I haven't been able to make friends, I can get into romantic or sexual relationships perfectly fine. Any social attention that I get are from men who want to date me or have sex with me. My last relationship went to shit because he lovebombed me for months until seasonal depression hit me, after which he completely discarded me, treated me like an obligation, and chose his friends over me. Whatever insecurities I had before were just exasperated because he had so many friends while he was literally my only friend. I couldn't understand what he had that I didn't. He's a piece of shit too but that's besides the point. I'm still healing from that relationship and telling myself that that was definitely a him problem, not a me problem. Right now my only friend that I hang out with is this guy I've been hooking up with. Say what you will but I am desperate for human interaction and conversations no matter what form that takes. These men give me just enough validation for me to know that I am still wanted after all.\n\nBut not with other women, though. I even got bumble BFF and that shit doesn't work at all. I've been engaging, asking questions to other girls in my area to talk and get to know them, but I get ghosted almost immediately after maybe a couple of responses from them. Why are they on the app if they aren't willing to do what the purpose of the app is? The same thing happens on dating apps (I'm bisexual). I just don't understand what is wrong with me. I genuinely think I'm a fine person. My best friend, who lives in a different country, reassures me of this all the time. They tell me that it's everyone else, not me. I have no choice but to think that that's the case because I have literally tried EVERYTHING and people just don't fuck with me. Is this really an everyone else thing? Am I trying too hard to fit in where I just will never belong? I'm planning on moving out after graduating so I'm just hoping to god that it's just a matter of location rather than me. \n\nThe reason why I think I'm completely fucked is because I don't know if I even have the capacity to have friends after never having had them (I think there is a definite difference between friends and romantic/sexual endeavors). I'm worried that once I leave this bubble that is my hometown and go out in the world, that it is truly a me problem after all. That I'm meant to be alone in this world. That people like me deserve to be alone forever. \n\nIf you've managed to read this entire thing then thank you!!

At times I had a couple of friends, and at other times I had absolutely none. Eventually, I just got used to it and decided I’d rather be alone than surrounded by fakeness. After graduation, I was completely friendless and never really fit in at my jobs since I was always the awkward one. Even after getting married and having kids, the isolation continued. I didn't fit in with my sisters-in-law and could feel the fakeness radiating from them, so I just kept to myself during family visits. Whenever I did make a friend, it was always one sided. They’d use me and leave. During COVID, I finally cut everyone out to focus on myself, but I eventually thought I was ready to try again.\n\nI’ve been at my current job for six years now. For the first three years, I wasn't social at all. About two and a half years ago, I finally decided to try being friendly with my coworkers. One girl in particular and I acted like best friends for two years. I really thought it was genuine because I knew very personal things about her life. But slowly the mask slipped. I realized the other coworkers knew everything current in her life while I was kept in the dark. They had their own group chats and hangouts that I was never part of. Then, one day on break, she said the quiet part out loud. She told me, \"You remember how I used to always b*** with Bre? Well, she's gone, so now you’re my new person.\" I wasn't a friend; I was just the backup for the person she actually liked. I was just the placeholder.\n\nSince then, she’s grown distant. She went on leave two weeks ago and texted me once. I replied, and I’ve been left on read ever since. I’ve even told my manager that I feel like the invisible employee, out of sight and out of mind. To test it, I’ve left my name off lists before just to see if anyone noticed. No one did. One time it took them over three hours to even realize I wasn't there. They don't even try to hide the exclusion anymore. They did a secret Santa and didn't even give me the paperwork to sign up. I’m only talked to if it’s a one on one shift; the second it becomes a group, I’m ignored unless it’s work related. I know they talk behind my back, and I think the friend I had even tells the managers what I vent about.\n\nI am completely done. This cycle of trying and getting hurt never ends. I bury myself in hobbies to pass the time and distract myself from the loneliness, but I hate this life. I don’t want anything to do with my coworkers. Some days I don’t even want to go in, but I have bills to pay, so I suck it up and get through the shift. I just wish things were easier. Why does making friends never work? Why even try when you're just destined to be the backup?\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qqeot8/why_do_i_waste_my_time_just_to_be_forgotten_or/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qqeot8/why_do_i_waste_my_time_just_to_be_forgotten_or/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Initially there was a larger friend group but a lot of them slowly drifted away and we 3 stayed together as we thought we were the most alike. Back then it was mostly about weed, fun trips and hangouts. I never felt an emotional attachment to either of them, but they were the best option I had to call friends after I moved to this city in 2020. Still it was good and I always tried to be like them to feel included. But slowly I started to grow as a person and the things which used to be fun before started to seem a bit too silly and careless to be doing now.   \nAnd most importantly, I have completely opposite opinions from them about hookups and overall approach towards women. They are way more inclined on going to cheap clubs and trying to get girls for the night, whereas I personally find that very cheap and something that I would not do. This and a lot of things combined makes them two a lot more alike and I guess better friends than I am to either of them.   \nEven though I am the most successful than both in my career and in all the things that matter to me. And I prefer to wait for a genuine partner in future than to give myself away to anyone anywhere.   \nNow I have decided to move out to a new city to start a new life of my own, and one of the other two is also planning to leave soon aferwards. So we planned this trip together to this snowy place which I believed to be a farewell trip for us three. But, again their initiaive seem to very different than mine and they want to try to get some girls in the club who can potentially join us in the trip. This in my eyes completely disrupts the original purpose. Now I have decided to not join them in the club and will be directly joining them when we get on the bus. This has again made me feel different and weird and the guy who is boring. Even thought it's very rare for me to self doubt myself in these regards, but today it has let me question if I really am just a boring person, am I just too different. And more of these types of interactions make me want to move out sooner and get away from everyone I know here and hopefully find people who are alike me. I don't know if that's going to happen either.   \nJust wanted to vent. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

From 1st–8th grade I had friends (even felt popular at one point), but once high school started none of my friends went to the same school. I was always shy, and over time I became quieter and more withdrawn and reserved. Friendships disappeared, and online friends became my only outlet which was a bandaid over my growing loneliness.\n\nRecently, after working for a few years, I moved to a new country and decided to challenge myself by learning the language, partly hoping I might meet people. In class I ended up pairing one day with a very outgoing, eccentric girl with a big personality who completely dominates the room socially. She gathered people to go out for drinks, invited me (which I was very reluctant of going), and surprisingly it went okay.\n\n Over time we kept sitting together, doing tasks with each other (helped out while she was sick sending her hw and what we did etc), and after the holidays she invited me to a New Year’s party where she got me drunk for the first time. Since then she invited me like 5-6 times and to hang out with her friends. Somehow, by accident, I made a friend who is super kind, initiates everything, and includes me socially for whatever reason. (Woohoo, getting somewhere)\n\nNow, it's great and i truly didnt expect this to happen but what I did'nt expect is how intese this feels emotionally.\n\n Because I was socially and emotionally isolated for so long, the backlog of social deprivation is hitting all at once. I am very self aware and can see that my attachment feels extreme, I can see myself overthinking interactions, feeling emotionally dependent, and being affected by small things in her energy shifts and even when nothing bad is happening. She has many friends and a clear support systems, which obviously I don't yet. so the imbalance is very noticeable and clear. and it makes it harder for me to set boundaries or stay emotionally regulated. My heart rushes things and wants depth quickly (not romantically) even though I know this is early and needs time.\n\nShe’s genuinely a good person and also my bridge to meeting others. I’m trying to understand this adjustment phase, because objectively things are going well, yet I don’t feel as fulfilled or grounded as I thought I would. I also notice fear around losing this connection since she has many other options, and I’m aware that I’ve placed a lot of emotional weight on her simply because she’s my first real connection in a long time. I worry that this creates a one-sided emotional imbalance and will not align.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\n\nfinally making a friend after  isolation and struggling with intensity, attachment, or imbalance?

I was really comfortable not talking to anyone even though I had made friends. But by the time school was in person again I was now officially in my freshman year of highschool, and nobody from my middleschool went there so it was all fresh new faces. I had completley forgotten how to talk to people and was even afraid to look at them or in their direction. All of the social skills I had beforehand had completely disappeared. I was afraid to talk to anyone and everytime I looked in the direction of someone, even if it was to see where I was going, when they looked back at me I would quickly turn my head in the other direction to avoid being called a creep. This actually did the complete opposite and made them think I was a creepy pervert who was staring at them. These rumors grew and grew over the years and made me become more and more insecure about everything I did. The idea that I was a creepy pervert stalker was especially being pushed by this group of 3 mean girls who made fun of me. It was weird because they treated me like a pet sometimes and were being fake nice to me. they would go up to me, say I was their bestie, and then walk away making fun of me and laughing. they 100% viewed me as an idiot. Anyway the insecurities got so bad that for a good year I couldn't even walk properly. I remember that one day I was walking and one girl made fun of me for the way I walked. So because of this I started walking with my hands in my pockets because I was afraid I looked stupid walking with them at my side, and I changed the way I moved my feet while walking making me look even more stupid. It got to the point where each year of highschool I would change something about myself In an attempt to appear more normal, but ended just making myself look more strange, and more like how a creepy weirdo would look like. which is initially what they accused me of being. the fact that I never spoke and stood up for myself probably is the reason so many people believed it, I was just reaffirming their beliefs the more insecure I became. By the end of highschool I was wearing a full on hoodie because i was afraid people would make fun of my hair, a mask because I was afraid people would call me ugly, I walked around with my hands in my pockets, I didnt speak, and I had no friends. Literally the prime look for someone who you would assume to be a creepy weirdo. my mom called it a self fulfilling prophecy and she's right. It also didnt help that I was in a summer program throughout all 4 years of highschool that some people from my school attended. The rumors spread there and that was a whole other group of kids who saw me as a weirdo. Initially all of this caused so much stress that I was considering killing myself. But now after 4 years I'm out of highschool and off to college. I thought everything would be great but there is one person from my highschool in my college and she just so happens to have the same major as me, literally what are the fucking odds. I still dont really talk and am still insecure and she's already spreading the rumor that I'm a creep and a stalker. I dont know if I can handle another 4 years of this shit and I just started my second semester of college. I have no friends, nobody to talk to, and I've resorted to talking on reddit of all places. I feel like im fucked since the rumors have already started, who is even going to want to speak to me, my college is already relativley small so word would get around quickly.

Loneliness is just a part of who I am and it's always who I'm going to be. For so long, I've tried to combat it. It seems like all people wanna do is talk to me and nothing more than that. My friends either don't have time for anyone or they have time for others but not me. More so the latter.\n\nI learned to just focus on myself and my hobbies and I did that for the longest time. But then the urge came crawling back, making me wanna ask my friends if they wanna do something together. Physically, it's tough for me to get along with people. I won't get into why but I've made peace with it, that I'll just live vicariously through seeing my friends' stories of them eating at Korean BBQs with their other friends.\n\nSo I tried online, hoping it'd be different. But no, it's all the same. Friends will tell me that they were playing and hanging with their other friends online and just ask me how I've been instead of saying that we should play or hang sometime. Just when I feel like I'm an inch away from having company, it slips from me. I don't get why. I really don't. I have deep conversations with a lot of them, talking about an array of things simultaneously. Sending voice notes to each other. It's not like it's surface level or too casual for us to do stuff.\n\nOne of my friends planned out a gaming session with me earlier in the week. No response. I asked her the day before if we're still on for it but nothing. It's been days and I haven't even gotten a \"hey sorry for not replying.\" It would've been the first time her and I ever gamed since we met, and we've known each other for almost 1.5 years. I introduced another friend to a game and we played it and she really enjoyed it, but she didn't ask me to play it with her again. Instead, she just messaged me that she's been playing it so much and I saw that she beat it.\n\nAnother friend was telling me that she's playing a game and I asked if she's down to stream it. She just hit me with the \"ohh idk if my laptop's capable of that.\" Mind you she has a 165hz AMD overclocked gaming laptop with RGB. It's more than capable. Just another bullshit excuse, because when I followed up and told her that it's very much capable, nothing. She replied to every other message but that. There's another friend that always tells me she's playing games with her other friends for hours, loses track of time. Told me she mostly stays at home and sits in her room for hours but then went out of town to visit a friend. She couldn't coordinate watching a fucking 3-minute trailer with me.\n\n  \nI don't get it. I try not to be pushy. Not to toot my own horn but I'm always understanding. Even when that friend told me that she basically played that game without me and beat it, I hyped her up telling her that's awesome and I'm glad she enjoyed it. There's a part of me that wants to scream out to these friends, \"Come on, can't we do something together just this once?\" But I don't wanna make them uncomfortable. Meanwhile, they'll tell me about how much time they spend with their other friends. \"I was up all night playing abc with xyz\" etc.\n\nIt just seems my friends make more effort with their other friends. But with me it's just like, \"ehh I'll just talk to him and that's it.\" Maybe it's just time for me to accept that accompaniment isn't for me.

I try to ignore how lonely i am. But it gets thrown in my face. Even when i feel like ive tried to be myself people are rude to me. Im not making it through college. People there are going to be so professional and advanced and smart theyll know everything and be normal all while ill be behind everyone because even when I tried to be heard it fell on deaf ears. I hate that i was born with nothing special because if i had some talent or something, maybe then people would like me. All that i can do is draw and my art isnt even that good even though i started so long ago.

I would like say that realistically I am not that \"lonely\". I do have my family, partner I live with, and a solid amount of friends. However, many of my \"OG\" friendships have withered away over the years.\n\nI am currently a 26 year old man. Many of my friends have been with me for 10+ years now. But lately it feels like I have to fight and beg for some kind of interaction with some of these friends. In one particular instance, my best friend from ages 15-21ish still doing the exact same thing we did during those years. We loved staying up late playing video games together just as most young people do these days. But the last few years he has stopped playing games with me, and is constantly playing other games with other people. I know this of course because of Steam and Disc-ord. I don't think it's wrong for me to view my friends list on steam or click on a server in disc and see that my \"friend\" is off playing games with other people. This really shouldn't bother me, other than the fact that he continues to tell me he is \"very busy\" and that we will \"play sometime\". When I do see him 1-2 times a year in person, it's like we never left. We chat it up and all is well.\n\nSo my question for all reading this is: What should you expect of your friends?\n\nI know there are many variables such as how close you are to the friend (figuratively and literally), but I would like to get a sense of what people expect from their friends. How often should you expect to talk to them, hear back from them after reaching out, how often to get together in person, etc.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qnujmk/friendship_expectations_leaving_me_lonely/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qnujmk/friendship_expectations_leaving_me_lonely/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I'm 21 years old now and it's been a few years since I've had a suicidal thought, but I was thinking back to my teenage days and it just got me wondering: after I moved out at 18, my family and childhood friends never really reached out to me - it was always me reaching out to them and trying to make plans - and when I stopped, we never really spoke or hung out again.  After I moved out, much as I tried to date and make friends, I never really ended up making a real human connection with anyone.  I wasn't a recluse at all, but all my connections were superficial and trying to get anything beyond that point required so much effort on my part for so little that eventually, it didn't feel worth it (I didn't want to simp to make a friend).  At this point, I don't think there's a soul in this world who really cares for me and to be honest, there's no one who I really care about anymore either.  \n\nI have all my bills on autopay and live pretty frugally - there's enough in my account to cover rent and all my other recurring expenses for at least the next 15 years.  I guess I was thinking about it and it kind of dawned on me that if I literally vanished of the face of the earth tomorrow, there'd be no one who'd notice for I think at least 15 years.  My coworkers would probably just think I found another job and outside of them there's pretty much no one who I see regularly . . .  I do literally everything alone or with random people I meet off of Facebook.  I think the only time someone would notice would be when my bills all of a sudden stop getting paid.  My landlord would probably just try and find me at point so that he could evict me.  It's got me feeling a little down tbh.  Anyone else ever think or feel this way?\n\nI'm naturally introverted, but I crave companionship and at the very least just a friend to travel with or go on hikes with instead of having to do all those things alone.  I miss caring about people and want someone to care about me too . . . atleast enough to notice if I went missing.    In the back of my head, it's always kind of there that everyone else seems to be able to find companionship naturally - maybe there's just something wrong with me.  \n\nSorry, this turned out to be so long, thanks to anyone who read this far.

And honestly, this affects me more than I want to admit. It makes me feel unwanted, behind, and defective, i feel like even if i find someone they will be weirded out by me not having any experiences whatsoever.\n\nWhat confuses me the most is that I don’t feel like I had any major trauma or anything that would “explain” why I’m like this.

{"id": "1qlu5hm", "subreddit": "lonely", "created_utc": 1769278163, "author": "Large-Meeting9354", "title": "Gap Year Loneliness", "selftext": "Hi, I am a British 18 y/o girl and finished my a levels last year. I was supposed to go 8 hours away to Falmouth university to study art but I dropped out after only 9 days (I didn't even go to the university- I just stayed in my accommodation the whole time so didn't even have enough opinion on the university to make an actual decision). I chalked up my want to leave as too much distance and a wanting to change course. I now plan on going to York university this October (somewhere half an hour away from home) and I am excited about it. But I keep on feeling this numbness/loneliness that I can't get away some days.\n\nI have multiple issues that I want to understand about myself:\n\n1. Wanting to self sabotage: I seem to always want to ruin things I am genuinely excited for. I don't know if it's an insecurity or what but I often find that I ghost friends, refuse to develop any sort of relationship, and often abandon things that I previously was looking forward to (university, sixth form). There is several other examples that I have noticed throughout my life. \n\n2. Wanting to stay at home: I have a very difficult relationship with my parents, they split up when I was a baby and ever since have had frustration towards my Dad. I have never displayed this frustration towards him and I believe I have bottled this up throughout my life which has caused so much anxiety and anger. Honestly, one of the reasons I wanted to move far away was to get away from him. With my mum however, I have quite a strong relationship with and have always wanted to stay with her instead of my Dad's. When I got back home, my Dad yelled at my Mum as I had expressed I wanted to stay with my Mum as I wanted to live independently and I believe the way to do that is to have one home and all my stuff in it. The way he spoke to her scared me into living in the usual pattern as before (A few days with my Dad and a few with my Mum). I really struggle at setting boundaries with him so him being able to break one of my boundaries I tried to set really knocked my confidence. I don't believe my Dad is abusive, I just think he is manipulative (Which I recognise is a type of abuse but I have never felt in danger with him- Just uncomfortable and not knowing what to say to him).\n\n3. A lack of friends: As I have said previously, I don't have many friends and the friends I do have often don't want to speak to me as we both have never really texted each other or wanted to hang out after school- and now they have all gone to university and they will not talk to me at all. I have always had quite a low view of myself- which I think is why I have had poor taste in friends (I know that sounds mean but I have picked friends that share no interests with me and do not speak to me outside of school whatsoever). This is also the reason I am so confused, as in my few days at Falmouth I did find that my flatmates wanted to talk to me but I just didn't speak to them. I really do want friends, as sad as it sounds I often daydream about having friends and hanging out with them- but when it becomes real I find that I hide away.\n\n4. Lack of hobbies: I do not have any hobbies at the minute. I used to love painting, it was one of the few things that gave me joy- But ever since dropping out of my art degree, I have found a lack of interest. Ever since, I have realised that Art played quite an important role in my life and made me genuinely proud of myself. But I really struggle to get back into it due to the unhappiness I feel in my life. I recently got a ps4 in hopes to get into video games to pass the time - but I still find it difficult to focus and normally just end up on TikTok (Which I have an average of 6 hours a day on)\n\n5. Unemployment: I am unemployed and live in an area where jobs get swiped up easily. This has made it extremely difficult for me to engage in anything. But sometimes I think I'm deliberately not applying for jobs or forgetting because I want to stay sad and lonely. From this, I think I like the loneliness on some level because it is more comfortable compared to the alternative. I understand that this is a sign of depression - but I'm not sure if I am depressed or if it's because of my circumstances. I am genuinely excited for the future and I'd like to think I know that I will have all different kinds of relationships in the future - But I just can't get rid of the idea that I'm missing out on so much right now. I understand I have the rest of my life but I feel I've been waiting for my life for so long that I'm not sure when it's going to actually arrive. \n\nI do have multiple reasons on why this is happening. I have an autism diagnosis that I waited 6 years for (thank you NHS), and a failed ADHD diagnosis that I did not get as I did not pass the classroom observing, but I passed everything else - which really affected my understanding of myself - but I have thought this is because of the lack of understanding of women with ADHD. I also have had maladaptive daydreaming since I was about 12 - which has very much affected my social skills as I have often locked myself in my room to picture the fictional characters in my head. My parents aren't aware of this and they probably never will. \n\nI have searched the internet so many times to understand what is wrong with me but I am often faced with: 'talk to someone' or 'talk to a therapist'. I have talked to my mum about some of my struggles, my school counsellor, and a woman that tested me for autism but it hasn't helped me so far. I really don't want the answer to be depression as I have felt this way for as long as I can remember I just think I am finally facing them because of how little I have to do- but I do understand I seem depressed. I just want to know what is wrong so I fix it and get on with my life. \n\nI know I have rambled and half of this doesn't make any sense and probably wont get a response because of it but just on the off chance someone knows what I should do or even someone who relates to my issue I thought I would put this out there.

Feel free to ask any questions! \nDo not ask anything sexual, I will not answer.\nMods if I write something listed as a big no no in the rules please inform me as it's my first time posting 🙏\nI'll put the 📋 emoji about how the experience shaped me as a result at some places.\n\nI've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in my junior (3rd) year of high school. My family doesn't believe I have it, since they believe every person with a mental illness is \"crazy\". They grew up in a place where mental health was stigmatized, and we don't talk about it. \n\nTo summarize, BPD has 9 checkboxes to tick off and if you check out 5, you can be diagnosed. I checked out all 9 by the time I got diagnosed. (After an attempt, and committing unrelated crimes) \nMy father has DID (old name: multiple personality disorder), maybe I had a genetical bad start. \n📋 BPD impulsivity for me was committing crimes and abnormal eating behaviors. \n\n\nBPD made me live emotions at extremes, and Loneliness felt like a death sentence. \n\n\nI've been lonely all my life, starting from a young age as a \"clever\", \"only child\". My mother and father had some government related issues and I have had more than one identities (as in different names, surnames, different security numbers...), and with witness protection and constant moving, it was all a blur. I'm a victim of domestic, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. \n\nMy mother has un/diagnosed (long story) cleaning OCD and NPD. I never went outside as she believed I'd bring bacteria to the house. We still have shower days (3 days in a week) when we're allowed to shower, as she doesnt allow any other day.\nNever taught me how important my appearance was. \n📋 This is one of the reasons I never learned to made friends and socialize like my peers. \n\nMy father was and is a serial cheater, and I learned at 12 by eavesdropping that I have two older step sisters from his first marriage. He even attempted an IVF treatment in England with another woman to try for a baby boy while married to my mother. While he was great to me, he'd attempted to kill my mother right before my eyes many times. 📋 This further enforced the idea in my mind that I was unwanted, because I wasn't what they wanted clearly. It also contributed to my anxiety, seeing my mother almost dying many times. \n\nMy mother would take all her anger out of me. Whether that'd be yelling, threatening me, physically abusing me. Dont get me wrong, I wasn't a force of the nature.\nI was the most well behaved child you could ever ask for. I was quiet, easy to handle, rarely ever cried according to her. \n📋 I was scared to be loud or act like my age due to the abuse. It led to me having an even harder time talking and socializing. \n\nThroughout high school, when I started gaining a bit of autonomy with my growing age, she felt threatened. After minor arguments she'd come to my room with a fruit knife and try to attack me from the small door opening as I tried to close the door with my body for dear life. \n\nShe once beat me at a distant village at the stairs, and poured boiling hot water on me with a kettle. \n\nSent me away for 2 months, kicked me out, to a far city when I didn't score as high as she expected on the high school entrance exam.\n\nThese are just examples of what kind of a mother she was. \n\n📋 BPD symptom : idealization and devaluation.\nBut I never hated her 100% the way you'd expect. No. I clinged to the idealized version of her I made up in my head from the memories of when she'd show a speck of kindness to me. I begged for her to love me, but even when I was born, she was never motherly. Never once hugged me without complaint, made it seem like I was always a trouble.\nThen I'd suddenly start hating her, and so on. It was a whole circle. \n\nOnly times when I could hug her was when she was forced to come into the parent-teacher conference in middle school, because she'd be in public and be forced to seem like she cares for me. \nBecause she'd threaten me with abandonment in private.\n📋 her distance led to a BPD symptom : Fear of abandonment.\n\nThey isolated me when I was a child, as this much information and abuse would be dangerous for their image if it ever got out. My earliest memories are from when I was 1,5 years old (my mother abusing me), and 4 years old (parents fighting and police being called) respectively. \n📋 I was off to a bad start and never had healthy core childhood moments for me to develop a healthy emotional space. \n\nI used to leave for school after they'd fight, not knowing if my mother would be alive when I came back home. \n\nMy father used to clean his unlicensed gun at the breakfast table, and I'd freak out thinking he was going to shot us the next second, as family annihilation rates are high in my country. \n\nThese led to me being paranoid, overthink social interactions, be anxious, and emotionally be between extremes. \n📋 BPD unstable self image, unstable mood, paranoia and dissociation over time.\n\nI never understood why they treated me this way, and I'll never will. I know it's not my fault as I was a child, but it doesn't feel like it. \n\nBy the time school and friend stuff rolled around, I was an anxious misfit. I got bullied in middle school, and it lead me to attempt for the first time in 8th grade. \nI've felt so lonely, like this world was the cruelest place ever. \nEveryone could make mistakes, but I could never afford to slip up or the abuse would come right then and there. \n\nIn middle school, I was sexual assaulted by a group of boys in my class. They'd take pictures of me etc. and I'd be frozen in panic. I didn't know what sexual assault was and realized what happened at the start of 10th grade, way too late. I never told family, obviously.\n\nBecause my mother or anyone never taught me how to take care of my self and I had no internet access, I never learned how to care for my self and appearance. I'm fairly an attractive girl when I put effort (learning make up, hair, how to dress helped and I'm naturally slim), but in middle school I had no idea how to dress or do my wild hair. My mother was having a field trip with how I was having a hard time socializing as I had no trust in myself due to my appearance and constant belittling. She saw herself as above me, and me as an extension of herself. \n\nThis loneliness that was enforced on me later became a second skin, and I grew up into it. \n\nAll my life, I've \\*almost\\* never been in a single class photo. Not because I was avoiding them, but because people would take it behind my back. I was never a part of a group in middle or high school and elementary is a blur as I switched schools too much back then. \n\nPopular kids would be around the teacher, all too close, and I'd be standing awkwardly on my own at the side. A few days ago, the class groupchat was talking about which picture to choose from to put it on the yearbook. Around 40 photos over the 4 years I believe, and I was in only 1 standing at the very side. It looked awkward, and I'm glad they didn't choose that one. \n\nThe teachers knew I wasn't in those photos. I'm academically doing well, high grades whatever, but they never bothered to include me with other kids. Maybe it wasn't their responsibility but mine, and I feel a sense of shame for thinking I might be the problem. \n\nI didn't but the yearbook, or the senior year high school uniform. I saw it as a waste of money, as I wasn't close with anyone... but seeing everyone in my grade but me wearing that red sweater with '26 print felt extra lonely. \n\nI'll include more if I feel like it, thank you for reading.\n\n\n  \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qlm0fz/borderline_personality_life_story_and_loneliness/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qlm0fz/borderline_personality_life_story_and_loneliness/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Maybe because tonight I did it again sat in that half-empty theater row way at the back so no one has to look at me too long.

That I'm just a normal person enjoying something normal people do. But credits roll, lights come up, and reality hits. I shuffle out past couples holding hands, groups laughing, girls my age smiling at guys who aren't me. Hoodie up, head down, hoping no one notices the fat guy who came alone again. Hoping no one thinks poor thing or worse, nothing at all. I do the same with food. Last week at that little place I like, I ordered the meal for two because why not twist the knife, right? Corner table facing the wall so I don't catch reflections or stares. Waiter asks if anyone's joining. I mumble no face burning. Ate in silence scrolling my phone to look busy, not lonely. But I wasn't busy. I was just trying not to cry into my plate. Every solo date rips something open. Deep down I know why I'm alone. It's not I like my own company. It's because no one wants to be seen with me. No one wants to sit across from this face, this body. Mirror shows the double chin that won't go away, skin that looks wrong, eyes that vanish when I rarely smile. I want what everyone else has so badly it physically hurts. Someone to share popcorn with. Someone to laugh at dumb scenes with. Someone to walk out holding hands, not pretending the empty seat was planned. Someone who looks at me and doesn't flinch. Someone who chooses me. But I'm convinced it'll never happen. So I keep doing these things alone. If I stop, I have literally nothing. At least this way I taste good food, see good stories, feel something briefly. Even if every bite tastes like failure. Even if every scene reminds me I'm watching other people's lives while mine stays stuck. Does anyone else feel this? The loneliness like a weight on your chest that never lifts? Screaming inside with no sound? Invisible except when taking up too much space?\n\nIf you've cried in a dark theater, stared at your food wishing someone was across from you, or just get this ache please say something.

Coping with this is so painful. The sense of loneliness and isolation this causes to me is so damn painful, and this hits me like a truck. She is the only person who wanted to hang out with me at the cinema, at the park and the mall. She gives me company. She understands me and likes being with me. And now this company is gone for a few years. And I don't have anyone else near me who has the same closeness to me, understands me and who gives me the same amount of affection as she gave me. And I love her so, so much that I even have some romantic feelings for her, even if I have a partner right now (who is 8 hours away from me), so seeing her depart to Europe for a long time breaks me a lot. And I don't know how to replace the company that she gave me, because I don't have anyone else.\n\nAnd I don't know how to find someone else, because when I contact the friends I know here in my city, they're always busy or they're just not interested in hanging out with me. I just want that connection, that closeness, that understanding… but no one wants to provide that to me. I think I am too repellent, weird and autistic for people. I feel most people can't stand me. Some months ago, an asshole who I called friend dumped me right after I begged her for a birthday meetup that she promised because she couldn't attend. When she dumped me, she told me that she wasn't the friend I needed. Like.. why did she decide to be my friend then? She could have easily spared me from a lot of sadness, suffering and pain. And now, I don't even know if anyone wants to come to my birthday party this year.\n\nThinking about the weekend is so painful, because I now do not have anyone to do things with. I'll have to go to the park and the cinema alone, while feeling miserable and pathetic. Going to those places without a person who is close to me and I enjoy being with is just not the same. It really feels sad. And it breaks me seeing friends with their squads hanging out, families enjoying the moment while I am there, being a pathetic lonely loser, having to conform with plushies, action figures, or fictional worlds I create to at least enjoy some company. And I just don't know how I can replace the company she gave me. I haven't been able to connect with people. Everyone ends up treating me as if I were a burden to them and then they just end up vanishing. They just pretend they're friends with me, but they always treat me very condescendingly. And they don't seem to care for me. They never text me. They never ask me how I am. They never invite me even for some coffee. I just don't feel valued. I feel no one likes me. That my personality is just too much for people. It's so sad living like this.\n\nThis means I will need to stay home with my boomer, conservative, transphobic and abusive father. I don't like being with him. He makes me feel that I'm not in a safe place. But my other safe places are disappearing. That is why I'm grieving this so hard. Because I need spaces where I can be myself. Where I am treated well, and where I enjoy the company of people who value me and make me feel cozy.\n\nAnd my brain just wants more connection, closeness, depth and love. And I am very angry that I haven't been able to find the love that I deserve.

Like oh bro you dont think we TRIED THAT??????? Being lonely is literally something nobody chooses to be. Hell i would bet alot of us here are lonely because beither we do not have people like us around or even online even when trying to reach out.\n\nEven online its horrible. I hate how  when youre lonely people try to  blame you wnd its usually the people whove never felt an ounce of loneliness in their life too. Youre told to keep beating a dead horse bro its not working. I think if just going out and talking to people worked most of us woukdnt be here????\n\nIts ignorant because they forget that even making bonds is not a 1 way thing. You could be the most social  person and talk to everyone and STILL be lonely or fail to make true friends. Youre told  to  try doing this and that but tou dont think we tried that?? People like this will only understand if they could see our firsthand experiences being lonely. For me its so lonely  being forced to work with people who literally dont even talk. I have to work on my assignments alone deapite having 2 partners next 2 me. People never pay me any mind and ignore me even if i raise my voice in desparation to be heard. There. Is. No. Winning.  They dont realize that there has to be a mutual effort between people for a healthy friendship and often what happens is the lonely person has tried to reach out just to be ignored.\n\nHell, online being lonely is so painful. I cant say which hurts mkre but i feel like with online its easier to sense peoples dislike of you even if you havent done anything wrong, and people will dehumanize eachother often because being only automatically seems to make us forget theres a human behind the screen. Ive had people ghost, block, or kick me from servers or groupchats or just slowly bully me out of them. The most painful experience ive had was in a server where they made a channel specifixally for me to ramble in about my intrests. But they didnt care about what i was saying at all. Even when i was talking one of them said they didnt care about what i was saying. It slowly made me refrain from even talking or playing there because I was just met with that behaviour.\n\nIts even worse for people who are so lonely they talk to ai because people bully them shun them for it instead of telling them to get help. This id why some linely  people stay lonely because any ounce of vulnerability we show gets disregarded. So many fake people who just pity you.\n \nIf you know someone like this, let them know saying things like this are annoying,useless,and ignorant. If they dont understand tell them its like telling someone whose depressed to just be happy.

I do have a 'close' group of friends that I hang out with every day at school, but when the day comes to an end, I don’t know if I’m as close with them as I think I am. In group chats, I’m always the first to reach out and, more often than not, I’m left on seen or delivered, with only one friend responding to me. I normally never take it to heart, as I understand my friends are just like that.\n\nI have been friends with them for about three years, this being the fourth, and texting isn’t something we do often. At first, I thought it was because I joined the friend group much later and they weren’t that comfortable with me. But even now, I barely have someone I can text on a whim, as they often reply late. Whenever I ask to hang out (play games or go out somewhere), they’re always busy or unable to, which is 90% me asking. I understand that they’re busy and I don’t expect them to agree every time, but I feel like sometimes they could have made time or an effort, even if it wasn’t long. I see them post stories on Instagram going out with other friends after I had asked to hang out a couple of days earlier. I tell myself that the plans were probably planned much earlier, but I don’t understand why not a single friend has texted me about anything. \n\nOne of my friends is the only one who has texted me and replies to my messages about hanging out-but even with them, I feel distant. I haven’t gone out with them at all the past few months, despite the occasional text about going out. In the past, I have listened to all their rants about their crush and know that if they wanted to, they would have. My friend would always text and call with their crush, even if it was at school or anywhere, in fact. I’m not expecting them to drop what they’re doing, as I’m not the person they hold dear—but what I’m trying to say is, I know they would have made an effort if I were more important.\n\nI truly believe they aren’t inherently bad friends-I’m just probably feeling lonely or insecure and am overthinking all this. \n\nI have never written a post, and frankly, I don’t know what I’m doing.

I have a normal life, normal office job, have my own apartment, pay the bills, have a cat, have friends and a social life, have good social skills, am of normal attractiveness, good hygiene/weight, etc.\n\nFor whatever reason, I have just never had success with relationships. Even though it's all I've really ever wanted. Ever since I was a little boy, I fantasized about finding the love of my life, having a house, a family, etc. No one was ever interested in me as a teen, but I figured things would just change when I became an adult. Then I turned 18 and nothing changed. Got to 25, still nothing changed. Watched all my friends people around me get in normal, long-term relationships or marriages, while I just never met anyone. Again, all this despite being socially active and part of multiple friend groups.\n\nI didn't have my first kiss until 27, and lost my virginity at 28 to my first and only long-term gf. Because I didn't know anything about relationships, I allowed my gf to abuse and manipulate me for 1.5 years until I was about 30. It wasn't even much of a relationship in the first place, because after 3 months of dating, she moved to Europe and spent the remainder of the \"relationship\" there. From what I know now, most likely cheating, while I spent about a year miserable and alone, clinging onto crumbs because I was terrified of being \"alone\" (of course, I already was). I went to Europe to surprise her, where she dumped me and left me stranded in Berlin, where I seriously contemplated simply just not returning to America, and instead jumping in front of a train.\n\nOf course, here I am, a little over a year later. But every day is a struggle, and I am constantly miserable. Everyone drones on and on about how I need to love myself and find contentment within myself, but of course, most of these people have someone and don't know what it's like to be chronically single. I think people have different needs. I think some people can be perfectly happy alone and left to themselves. My little brother is like that. And I think some others, despite maybe liking relationships, are okay with either-or.\n\nTo me, having someone to do life with, and eventually a family, has always been my \"purpose\" since I was a kid. It's what I've always known would fulfill me and give my life meaning. Without it, I just don't really have any interest in being around. I have hobbies and things I enjoy. But I don't have any super all-consuming passions, or any great skill I'm really particularly good at. I'm just a normal guy with a middle-class job that comes home from work, plays with the cat, maybe does some gaming, or reads a book. Hits the bars and has a good time with friends on the weekends, has people over for the occasional party. But I always go back to my apartment alone, climb into bed alone. Come home from work to no one. I'll go outside to smoke a cigarette and watch couples in my apartment complex mill about with their children, and I just stand their numb, knowing that I'm already 31 and these people probably started their families in their 20s.\n\nI'm not incapable of talking to women. I can approach women at bars and shows, make good conversation, even score a number from time to time. But it never goes anywhere. Dating apps are a joke, I might get one match a month (if that) that fizzles out after a couple texts. I legitimately feel like my life is just wasting away. I want to love and be loved by someone. Really know someone, and be known by them. Come home to someone. Be wanted.\n\nI think about ending it all every day, because I'm just not interested in an existence that goes on like this. I really do believe that if this status quo just continues until like 35, I really am going to do it. Does this make me pathetic? Does anyone else ever feel this way?", "score": 87, "num_comments": 13, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qk1qzc/is_it_pathetic_to_feel_that_life_without_a/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qk1qzc/is_it_pathetic_to_feel_that_life_without_a/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Not a rant.", "selftext": "TLDR version: Your life isn’t over. It’s okay not to have things figured out. It’s okay to be alone. Being “behind” is a lie.\n\nThe long yammering version:\n\nI made my first post here a couple of months back when I was having a particularly bad day, and in the days that followed encountered one of the saddest things I’ve seen on the internet. I see post after post of people in their twenties talking about there life like its over because they are “behind”.\n\nI get it guys. You likely when through your teens envisioning your twenties as this time when you were going to have it all together or at least have it as good as it was in your teens. But then you got here and it kinda sucks. Maybe you are in a new environment and struggle to meet people. Maybe you broke up with your only serious boy/girl friend and can’t even imagine moving on yet. Maybe all your friends have moved on to another phase of their life. Or, GOD HELP YOU, you spent four years in the Army, your brain was completely rewired and now you’re just trying to be “normal” whatever the hell that is. Maybe that transition from school where you were surrounded by single people your age, to work has completely thrown you off. Maybe the world is expecting you to be an adult and on the inside most days you still feel like a kid.\n\nI went through the darkest period of my life in my mid-twenties, so I know for a fact that this period that is supposed to be so great is often not that great at all. So, I’m going to say the things that I wish I could say to twenty-year-old me and hope this doesn’t sound too condescending:\n\nIt’s okay not to have things figured out. Your brain doesn’t even stop developing until your late twenties.\n\nIt’s okay to be alone. Your life is changing. The people around you have lives that are changing. There will be times when this chaos leaves you standing alone, and when that happens it isn’t about you.\n\nIt’s okay to not be okay. Life is hard and sometimes you are just going to feel messed up.\n\n“Do things get better?” The only honest answer to that depends on what you mean by better. Life is always going to be hard. You will always have problems. But you will get stronger. You will get better at dealing with them. You will adapt. So, in that sense things do get better.\n\nAnd most importantly there is not some schedule somewhere that you must conform to. Married by X. Career settled by Y. Buying into the idea that you are “behind” and therefore something is wrong with you, is a mental pit that is just going to get harder to get out of the longer you dig. Getting a good thing later than someone else got it does not make it less good. You just don’t have it YET.\n\nAnd last let me leave you with this thought. This subreddit is full of twenty somethings that feel this way, so in theory it should be a good place to find people to talk to. Granted most of the people who say they are looking for friends are really looking for a hookup, so you’ll get a lot of dick pics before you find someone who wants to talk to you, but the numbers are on you side.

Partly because of the move but mainly because I was not the best person in high school. I loved my friends very much but I was in an extremely abusive household and was very mentally ill. Looking back I recognize I emotionally relied on my friends wayy too much, I used them as a distraction and solution for my home life. The only thing I could’ve asked for was a honest conversation. \n\nOne of my closest friends at the time, known her for 5 years, stopped being my friend without ever saying anything about it. Then started dating my ex. She saw my home life the most and would reassure me the most about my behavior and issues. \n\nI thought if anyone understood and would want to have a conversation it would be her, but she completely went behind my back instantly.\n\nLike I said before I was not the best person, but i definitely tried for the people I cared about. I just know it wasn’t in the right way. But no one ever told me, everyone just pretended until it was too annoying to deal with anymore and left without a conversation. \n\nNo one owes me their time or friendship, i don’t blame them at all for not wanting to be friends either. \n\nBut now it’s been years later, I have a fiancé and he helps me a lot. I am very grateful for him, he made me grow as a person and recognize my problems. \n\nI have met gym friends and work friends but I have no idea how to make lasting friendships as an adult.\n\nLet alone how to make healthy friendships. Im so scared of repeating old patterns and or upsetting someone else. \n\nI think I may have OCD and Im aware I have a good list of mental illnesses that will make friendships more difficult for me. But I want to be a social person very badly, i just have no idea where to start.\n\nIt feels impossible for normal adults to make friends what chance do I have?\n\nI also don’t know how to leave behind my old friendships, i feel destined to be a bad friend. But at the same time I have so much love, creativity, and energy, to give to a friend. Im so lonely and I know a lot of people feel this way too.\n\nAny advice is appreciated and if you read this wall of text thank you <3\n\n(I am planning on finding a therapist and psychologist ASAP i just want other peoples opinions/views on healthy adult friendships)", "score": 4, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qjljg3/i_have_no_friends_and_its_my_fault/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1qjljg3/i_have_no_friends_and_its_my_fault/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}
