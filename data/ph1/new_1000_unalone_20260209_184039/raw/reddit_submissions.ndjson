{"id": "8ze7xk", "subreddit": "unalone", "created_utc": 1531771043, "author": "okko7", "title": "About /r/unalone: Current state of the project", "selftext": "For all those who follow this subreddit and who have the impression that there is not much going on, let me try to summarize what has been going on so far: \n\nThe idea of /r/unalone emerged from the impression that other subreddits such as /r/ForeverAlone/ or r/lonely/ are - while having their full usefulness and justification - are at times a bit depressing and we were looking for a place that focusing more on ideas, tricks, tips etc, similarly to what r/personalfinance/ does for personal finances. \n\nWhile initially quite a lot of people joined /r/unalone (there are some 220 redditors here at present), the conversations never got really dynamic. It was probably just not enough of a \"critical mass\" of people here to inspire each others. \n\nOut of this lack of interesting conversations grew the idea of a hackathon on what we can do about loneliness. That's when we started having almost weekly video-hangouts on our [discord channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/comments/7tihhu/the_runalone_discord_server/). \n\nAnd out of these conversations grew the idea of a movement like \"Alcoholics Anonymous\" but for lonely people. \n\nAt present, we are still very much in a brainstorming state. Ideas do get more and more concrete, but there are still rather embryos of ideas than an actual project. None the less, here is what we are discussing and working on: \n\n**The unalone meetups:** \n\nThe idea is to give the tools to individual to organise meetups that can make some change for lonely people. It's based on the premise that \"no one gets out of loneliness alone\" and it's to some extend inspired by Alcoholics Anonymous. It breaks down into several elements: \n\n* One or several meetup formats to bring people in loneliness together and support each other. The format should be documented in a way that individuals can easily organise their own meetups.\n* Some kind of a \"manifesto\" or \"12-step programme\" with some rules that we commit to uphold individually and promote in these meetups\n* A documentation to help people understand their own loneliness and give ideas / advice on how to get out of it.\n* An online platform to give visibility to the concept overall and to these meetups / local groups in particular, and to facilitate exchange of what works and what doesn't.\n\n**A idea / project development group:**\n\nWhile the ideas around the meetups get more and more concrete, we want to remain open on new ideas and - who knows - still organise some hackathon. Or maybe even just encourage and stimulate research on the topic and condense this knowledge in a good documentation. \n\n**What lies ahead**\n\nBy now our little group (there are about 5 to 7 people who participate regularly in our video hangouts) feels like an interesting little community and we feel motivated to go on, even if it is at a slow pace. The ideas get more and more concrete and we slowly feel like we can talk about it to others and grow the circle of involved people. \n\nSome questions and things that seem important to us: \n\n* **Science based:** Loneliness is a complex thing. To make this really impactful, we need to take latest knowledge into account. At some point we should actively reach out to researchers and get their input.\n* **Diversity:** There is likely no \"one size fits all\" approach. Meaning there are things that will work for some but not for others. Or more concretely, for example for the meetups: We likely need to define different formats to get different people involved. \n* **A distributed organisation:** We see a need for *some* form of an organisation, but for now see this going more into the direction of a \"movement\" than an \"organisation\". Eventually it would be good to have some kind of a formal entity. Simple things like creating a nice website may indeed require us to do some fundraising which in turn requires some form of an organisation. \n* **Anonymity:** We want to give people the possibility to get involved anonymously. \n* **Lean and agile:** These are buzzwords, but instead of building something big and then realise it doesn't work, we want to keep things open, want to try out different things, and then develop on what actually works. \n* **Take things slowly:** We all do this in our spare time. We have jobs that keep us busy. We don't want to put ourselves under pressure to produce quick results, but maintain the satisfaction of working on something meaningful and that could develop into something big.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/comments/8ze7xk/about_runalone_current_state_of_the_project/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/unalone/comments/8ze7xk/about_runalone_current_state_of_the_project/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Many know \\(and feel\\) they should be more social, but for so many reasons \\(busier work, alienating technology, social anxiety\\) citizens’ social lives have grown increasingly spare and windblown, sometimes without them realizing until it’s too late. Loneliness has become a quicksand for many.\n\nResearch bears this out: A recent [Cigna survey](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/01/loneliness-poor-health-reported-far-more-among-young-people-than-even-those-over-72/559961002/) of 20,000 Americans found that the national average loneliness score was a 44 on a scale of 20 to 80. Younger people \\(the so\\-called Generation Z\\) were disproportionately affected, with scores of 48. Their scores were higher than those 75 or older, who scored an average of nearly 39. Considering that longitudinal studies have found people with fuller social lives *are 50\\% more likely to survive than those who don’t* \\(an effect as powerful as smoking cessation\\) the need to address loneliness leaps into startling focus \\(Holt\\-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010, p. 14\\).  Put it this way: loneliness isn't just depressing \\-\\- it's lethal.\n\nAt Unalone, we believe human connection is a fundamental human need – a right – and are drafting ideas to address this urgent issue. We recognize loneliness as a mental and physiological state *distinct* from depression, although it shares many symptoms \\(Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008, pp. 83\\-86\\). We also realize that loneliness may present differently based on personality, age, situation, and culture.\n\nHere are some ideas we are currently exploring:\n\n• A decentralized organization inspired by Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\n• A hackathon on loneliness.\n\n# References\n\nCacioppo, J.

Not something centralised and top down, but rather distributed. \n* **Input:** we see potential if we go to talk to experts in the field, e.g. academics/practitioners/authors. Insurances may also be interested in the topic. But talking to non-experts concerned by  loneliness is an important topic.\n* **Explicite/implicit**: Question that came up: Should we rather focus on a positive wording (e.g. \"purpose\") or actually talk about \"loneliness\". There are many meetups/organisations that are organised with the purpose to bring people out of loneliness, where that topic is never intentionally and explicitly brought up. There seems to be a consensus that we should explicitly mention \"loneliness\" but in combination with positive wordings, in particular \"purpose\". \n**New people**: It's good to see that since we started, we had practically each time a new person joining in. \n\nNext steps: \n\n* **Google drive.** Already set up,\n* **Website:** Basic website is ready. Content under heavy work though (text now on shared google drive. \n* **Exploration:** Continue exploring / talk to people to get feedback and input and integrate insights into document now on google drive.\n\n**Next meetup: Saturday, May 12th, usual time. 11am CDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST. Note: Many of us seem to be absent.

Simple but functional. The more we talk around us, the more it's important to have it.\n* New person: Steve joined us. \n* Brainstorming: We talked about content and format of the hackathon and how to get people involved. The number of people who want to help is growing, but the concept around all of it is still very vage. We could try to connect to groups on Meetup.com who have a local presence. Spreading the word through these? Thus maybe organise a meetup that is not fully online only, but with local \"branches\" that meet face to face? And should this hackathon be part of something bigger? But how to build something bigger without a central organisation?  \n* Mission statement: Linked to the above, we thought that it might be useful to work on something like a \"mission statement\", some guiding principles (more than what is currently in the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/wiki/index) that could be used as a general framework to guide our discussions. \n* Purpose: Based on some discussions on Reddit, it seems that lack of \"Purpose\" is something lonely people often lack. We could focus more on that for our own team, but also for those whom we want to involve as participants. \"Purpose\" has a more positive connotation than \"loneliness\"...\n* Connecting to \"experts\": We could try to contact people who have a deep knowledge in that field and who could help spread the word, e.g. authors of famous books. \n\nTo do: \n\n* Josephe continues working on the website.\n* okko7 explores the idea of a mission statement\n* Steve: Puts together a list of literature / references that could be integrated in our website.\n\n**Next hangout:** Next Saturday, May 5th at the same time (10am CST, 11am EDT, 17:00 BST and 18:00 CEST) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4aT3pc).\n\nAnything to add from those who have been present?

That the only reason why you still suffer that crippling feeling is because it is your fault. That you are so stupid, insecure, awkward, weird, unsociable, or any combination of a million other self-degrading descriptors to ever find a friend. \n\nFor me, there even came a point in my life where I well and truely believed that I was *doomed* to die alone. I legitimately cried constantly to the thought that I would survive to an old age never having found a true friend, living a wretched and miserable life, only to die knowing no one and no one caring for my passing. I truely believed that was my fate because I had dealt with being so intensely alone for so long that I truely believed there was some indescribable thing about me which was broken beyond repair. That I was just *born* to never be able to make a real human connection.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nBecause that is the trick that lonliness plays on the mind. You get so *entirely* desperate for *anyone* to be your friend that each and every person who does not become your friend is a renewed dissapointment. Another chance to have found a true friend who you scared off or embaressed yourself around or who just simply... drifted away. \n\nThe truth of the matter is that lonliness tricks you into contradicting feelings of both being terrified to meet or get close to people (since it will confirm your fears of why you are alone) and also desperately latching on to anyone you can.\n\nThe first feeling makes it more difficult to find a friend because you limit your options. After all, how can you meet the people you have a connection with if you keep yourself to yourself?\n\nThe second feeling, makes you focus in on anyone who gives you the attention and affection you desperately want. It makes you attach yourself to the first person who makes you feel special. So much so that you can not walk away from them, even if you know you should.\n\nIn any case, the purpose of this post is to say that you are not alone in your feelings. There are hundreds of thousands of people who feel just as you do now and that you do have hope to find a true connection with people. \n\nI know I have. :)", "score": 7, "num_comments": 12, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unalone/comments/7teuej/being_alone_in_lonliness/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/unalone/comments/7teuej/being_alone_in_lonliness/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}
