No friends. Now I am invisible on top of it all because I'm old. I see so many younger people saying how lonely they feel, how separated from everything they are. You need not feel this way. Take it from someone who has gone so far beyond lonely that it has become comfort. I've been alone longer than most of you have been alive.\n\n  Loneliness can mean safety! No one can hurt you when you are alone. It is such a tremendous vulnerability that it radically strengthens your heart and soul. You can find peace in loneliness. You must because if you cannot tolerate your own company, no one else will tolerate you either. To be accepted by others should never be your goal. Accept yourself first.\n\n  I love who I have become because of all the time I have to think and self-reflect. I can see so much more about people being a silent watcher of the world. It has helped me find myself in the darkness of depression. It only takes a single spark of light to banish darkness in yourself. Once you can see this, you can never unlearn it.\n\n  What I have learned (and see wrong with everything the world faces now) is that nobody even talks about something that used to be common knowledge. The last four generations have lost a single bit of knowledge and nobody talks about it.\n\n  What is an adult? A certain age? Having a child? Getting married? Having a job? Supporting yourself or others? None of these things makes a person an adult. This is why you feel separate and alone: Your emotions are in control of your mind instead of the other way around. Lack of emotional control is why the world is helpless right now.\n\n  If someone's emotional reactions are the first thing their mind does in any situation, then the emotions control them, not their thoughts. If your mind cannot control the emotions then the emotions control the mind. This means that person has no control of themselves or anything that occurs.\n\n  More thought than feeling, more reason than reaction; this is what an adult is. Someone who has control of themselves. If emotions are first then any thoughts after only serve to placate and ease the emotions assuring the person that they are right. However if the mind is first then it can think clearly and arrive and the proper emotional response. This is when emotions become powerful because they are righteously backed up by reason.\n\n  Look at the news, look at your social media, look at a show or a movie. You will see this everywhere in every issue. Look within YOURSELF especially. You are not alone. Everything you have is made by other people. Everyone needs you and you need everyone in your life. Who mined the metal that made your car? Do you care who invented the flat screen you're reading this on? Are you grateful for other people?\n\n  The human species has lost something and it's time to wake up for real. It is time to grow up for real. It's lord of the flies out there and now they are grown up and worse. People are raising children and not raising adults.\n\n  I am alone.", "score": 11, "num_comments": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qwnypl/think_you_are_alone/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qwnypl/think_you_are_alone/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I feel i have lost myself. All my life i have felt as if i am a leaf drifting along a river with no ability to control my direction. I have never applied myself. Never needed to. I was able to satisfy my parents and society by barely trying. Not outstanding but never a failure either. Just above average to keep others who had expectations of me off my back.

I said I’d never write on here about my personal life because I didn’t see the point but I don’t know what else to do as I have no one. I just wish this pain could vanish and I could be more present in my own life instead of surviving.\n\nI am someone who is kind,soft,open minded, authentic, I treat others the way I’d like to be treated, deeply empathetic and try to always make other people feel seen and heard, I hate seeing people sad I genuinely do it makes me feel terrible, I can’t ever fully dislike or hate people even after I’ve been burned over and over repeatedly because I try to understand and see things from they’re perspective, all I ask for is the same reciprocation and do I ever get that, no, people are so quick to project and judge me, I feel like I ask for too much when in reality I’m asking for the bare minimum. I feel maybe I think and feel too deeply and it’s my fault for being the way I am.\n\nI was in a 3 year situation ship or whatever the hell that was and before you judge me and say “3 YEARS” I was young and naive (19) and thought everyone was like me genuine and pure but I guess I was wrong. We slept together multiple times over and over again over that time, I’ve even lost count how many times we’ve slept together, at first I thought he was the sweetest guy ever and now I realise (I’m 23 now) he was just lovebombing me.\n\nIn the beginning, at first I actually wasn’t so smitten I was a bit guarded then overtime I started to let up, and as soon as I did that the roles reversed suddenly he didn’t care as much and I cared. It became toxic he told me he’d never been in a relationship and now I know that was a lie. I was in my uni accommodation at the time so he’d always come and see me and we’d smoke green. He was so emotionally underdeveloped it was insane it was like being with an 8 year old in a 21 year olds body (I was 19 and he was 21).\n\nWhen I was with him I forgot to mention I was fat but not ugly I am a very beautiful girl inside and out and I now see that and validate these traits in me now but at the time I thought that I deserved the treatment I received from him and should just be happy I was receiving something. A lie of the enemy. ( since then  I lost about 30 kg, I’m about 68kg now)  But yeah after I left my uni accom for my first year I decided to stay at home for the remainder of my degree (2 years) in that space of time, I’d cut off all my friends and fallen out of friendships, all they did was use and abuse me for my kindness and because I lived by myself they used me for my space too, one of my ex best-friends at the time was going through her own situationship that ended badly I helped her through, one thing about me is I’m a ride or die I’m loyal to a t she was in pain and wanted to smash up he’s car and begged me to come with her I had the option to say no but, I said let’s go then and I followed her I thought I was doing what’s right at the time but I guess I needed to have the discernment to know who deserves my wholeness and who doesn’t but yeah looking back dumb decision but I don’t regret it because I was doing what I thought a real friend would do. So anyways with this friend she was just weird we had been friends in college before but we stopped being friends and she she wanted to be friends again 2 years after which is when this event transpired.\n\nShe requested our friendship through my other ex best friend who I had known since secondary they knew each other through me, when me and her fell out in college I didn’t care I let them still be friends I didn’t make my best friend from high school choose but yeah after that event occurred with my ex bestfriends toxic car situation she asked me to pay for the smashing up of the car and I was like what why I was supporting and defending you I don’t think I should I pay for it and she said well you could’ve said no to coming I was just so confused but yeah In the end I agreed (this all links back to my situationship with this guy lol, sorry I don’t mean for this to be so long) the situation passed but I knew right there and then that I should drop this girl and she was using me it’s like the lights were on but no one was home with me at the time, but I still continued to be her friend.\n\nWe then went to the Tommy fury vs Ksi match in Manchester baring in mind it was a free ticket she said her aunty payed for it but she couldn’t make it so she said I should come and I was so grateful. We went, The whole match she ignored me and didn’t speak to me at all I was just sat by myself now baring in mind I was so drunk and so was she, and I asked her girl we came together can we speak she was like “oh sorry I like to wander off when I’m drunk ( even though she was sat right next to me ) now you’ve made me aware I’ll stop” and she goes back to ignoring me so I just sat there I tried speaking to the people next to me, she then spills her drink on me and I was like what the hell I guess it was an accident but I let it slide anyways after I’m quite irritated now like why invite me to do dumb shit like that? Should of just let me stay home but then yeah, I started trying to make myself happy by screaming and chanting for Ksi baring in mind the whole venue is chanting, she says I’m being so loud and I should shutup at this point me patience started wearing thin and then yeah we started going back and forth and we started laying hands on each other I don’t know how it started, I then got up and left the stadium.\n\nAnyways my stuff was at her brothers house because I travelled up to Manchester for the weekend as I live down south, I just wanted to get my stuff from her brothers house and vanish but I couldn’t because she had the key. I was so heartbroken and sad and was in complete despair I feel things so deeply it’s insane. After our squabble, the policemen saw me and said we’re going to take you to the hospital so I spent the night in the hospital, I woke up in the morning and my friend that I knew from high school let’s call her V I called and told her what happened and she was like agreeing with me and said what she did was wrong  my friend who I had a squabble with let’s call her TJ long story short V calls me and says you can go back and get your stuff she left your stuff outside for you I get there and TJ literally completely had ruined all my stuff my makeup and all my laptop everything my camera that I bought so we could take pics everything ruined I’m absolutely fuming at this point so I call my sister F and she said go into her brothers house and smash everything so I did because TJ had left (she’s from Leeds so she travelled back up) she made sure to leave, smash my stuff then leave, and me not catch her, anyways after I called the police but obviously there’s nothing they could do without cctv anyways she started a whole smear campaign about me so I fell out with multiple people some cut me off I cut off the rest. V chose her side after, she wasn’t fully there for me so me and her stopped being friends. I was left alone.\n\nNow back to my situationship, I had nobody just him left so I guess all my energy just went into him he doesn’t know any of my people, but yeah, I ignored red flags I let him use me and abuse me while giving all of me this went on for 3 years I couldn’t make friends easily I couldn’t trust people and I still cant I just isolated myself. I just poured all the energy to him, ( got about 10 songs out of it lol) i remember I was staying home this whole time so we would fool around in hotels and I’d pay all the time, until I lost weight he began to pay. The love I should’ve given me I gave him. And he loved the way I loved him, because I didn’t have anyone else the only person I have that is my constant is my mum. But yeah anyways with me and him I saw he began to catch feels for me and I vice versa but he would shut it down because he didn’t want to feel for me. And again I thought the problem was me because I was fat so I lost weight for him. I began to see a different side to him when I lost weight he began to desire me but even that wasn’t enough, he’d just shut it down, I knew he caught feelings but yeah anyways I found out he had an on and off relationship the whole time and I guess he’s now with her, I was the one who cut things off, and he seemed angry about it, the girl who he’s with she’s gorgeous and she wants to be a musician aswell, she has the perfect Instagram pretty tall everything curated to a T, I’m an artist aswell so I put all my pain into my music but now having gone through what I’ve gone through I’ve become terribly insecure nothings enough I feel like I have so much more weight to loose and I will loose it. There’s so many more situations that I can tell you guys but these are the ones that sincerely changed me. I go to to open mics and shows and people tell me wow I’d pay to see you sing, they see what I used to see so highly in myself but now I doubt myself now and believe I’m not enough, my self belief and image is at an all time low.\n\nI’m the one who’s picking up the pieces repeatedly. Everytime I think I’ve healed I get reminded that I haven’t, I have to become a singer it’s the only thing my heart sincerely feels and desires everything I’ve gone through has just made me want to pursue music. I’m so tired of getting my light dimmed, I deserve to take up space. I love to make people feel something, I love to make people feel heard and seen, for them to hear my lyrics and me put the words to what they’re feeling, say the words they can’t express but even my dreams don’t feel so real anymore but I cannot afford to wake up at 80 and regret not chasing and pursuing my wildest dreams. I feel like I’m not perfect and I keep comparing myself to her (the girl he chose over me).\n\nNow loosing weight and looking the best I ever have people are intimated, they see a pretty girl and think let me take her of her high horse or put me on a pedestal I never asked to be on. I can’t make friends as easily anymore, I just need a friend. I feel like I’m not enough people project they’re insecurities onto me it’s just too much when all I’m asking is for human connection. The 360 in the way I was treated when I was overweight and now I’m slim and curvy a is so insane people are so superficial, just because my exterior changed doesn’t mean my interior did. It’s also so easy for me detach now it’s like I’m so numb but so overwhelmed. I don’t get close to people so quick anymore I read through the surface level stuff straight away. I read people in 0.5 seconds and I can just tell your wearing a mask.\n\nI used to have such social media presence now I hide, why you may ask because I’m scared I’m not enough, scared people will judge me “I have to reach my goal weight” before I start posting again and I’m so tired of this battle I just want to be me weather anybody likes it or not, TJ said I’d never loose the weight and I did and the boy I was in a situationship with would always compare me to the girl who he’s now in a relationship with their voices and the things they said just live in the back of my mind, im tired of letting them define me I have nothing to prove anymore. I do have social media presence but I just keep on going ghost I’m scared. The thing is I know if I put my all and all in to music I’ll make it because I’m real. I have so much potential and ideas but it’s like I don’t know what’s happened to me, I have so much doubt now and insecurities I’m afraid it’s like I’ve become a shadow of myself.\n\nMy life is like a movie I’m also adopted the youngest out of 7 I was the only one who got adopted, I speak to none of my siblings that’s another story for another day but I’ve moved constantly my adopted parents got divorced when I was 12 they didn’t handle me well at all I just feel so alone, separate from these situations I’ve been betrayed by my many I put my trust in, no one has empathy for me they do they’re big one with me and move on like I never existed and I have to pick up the pieces one by one having to heal from damage I never caused. I’m not a victim but it’s hard not to take all this personal, every time I feel healed I’m reminded I’m not and the cycle repeats I’m over it, family is fake aswelll jealousy does exist when they don’t know the reality of my world. People constantly tell me I’m beautiful but I don’t believe it I miss who I was before heartbreak I miss the little me who had dreams beyond measure before her light got dimmed I do so much for people and gain nothing in return.

Dating and relationships as a fat man.", "selftext": "I’m 23 years old, I live with my parents, and I have never been on a date. Not almost. Not it just didn’t work out. Never. No first date. No hand-holding. No first hug and kiss. No one choosing me. No one looking at me and thinking I want him. Just silence. And it hurts more than I know how to explain. I live in the same house I grew up in. Same room. Same walls. Same ceiling I stare at when I can’t sleep. I hear my parents moving around, living their lives, and I feel like a ghost in my own body. Surrounded by people, but completely alone in the one way that matters to me. Every night I open my phone and it feels like the world is mocking me. Couples. Engagements. Dating stories. Complaints about bad dates and even those hurt, because at least someone wanted them enough to try. I don’t even get a chance to fail. I don’t get a chance at anything. Being a fat man feels like being disqualified before i even speak. Like my body answers the question before my personality ever gets a chance. People say just be confident or it’ll happen when you least expect it, but they don’t know what it’s like to feel invisible every single day. To wonder if anyone has ever looked at me with desire instead of tolerance. Sometimes I catch my reflection and feel this wave of shame I can’t escape. I wonder if this is the reason. If this body is the reason I go to sleep alone. If this is why love feels like something meant for other people or thinner people, better people, people who deserve it more than me. Living with my parents makes it worse. It makes me feel like I’ve failed at becoming an adult. Like I’m already behind, already undesirable, already someone no one would want to build a life with. I imagine trying to explain myself to someone and I feel humiliated before the conversation even starts. I try so hard to be good. I try to be kind, funny, thoughtful, emotionally available. I listen. I care deeply. I would love deeply. But none of that seems to matter when no one ever gives you a chance to show it. All of my efforts are useless😔.Some nights I tell myself I’m strong. That I don’t need anyone. That I’m okay alone. And then other nights like tonight the loneliness crashes into me so hard I feel like I can’t breathe. Like there’s a hole inside my chest where love is supposed to go.I don’t know what it feels like to be chosen. I don’t know what it feels like to be desired. I don’t know what it feels like to be someone’s person. I literally don’t know how it feels to get a hug from someone and how it feels when someone holds my hand. And at 23, I’m terrified that the longer this goes on, the more broken I’ll become. That one day I’ll wake up older and still untouched, still pure, still unseen, still wondering what was so wrong with me that no one ever stayed. I’m not posting this for attention or pity. I think I’m just exhausted from carrying this alone. I want to know if anyone else feels or going through the same pain. This invisible. This far away from the life you wanted. I live with my parents, but tonight I’ve never felt more alone. If you read all of this, thank you so much🙏🏻.

He was my roommate and a huge part of my support system. Unexpectedly, he passed away. Losing him alone has been devastating but what made it even harder was that his passing left me and my dog with only about two weeks to figure out where to live and what to do next.\n\nLuckily for me i have a really strong support system back in Texas so i know im loved. I sometimes feel guilty because i know they worry because im a young woman 1000s of miles away from my birth family.

Its like i’ll look around my new home and feel completely displaced even though i love it.\n\n I’ve been trying to stand on my own in a city that still feels like home but I don’t have family here, and my circle is very small. Most days it’s just me, my dog & sometimes my boyfriend , navigating grief quietly while the world keeps moving.\n\nI’m also an aspiring nail tech, currently working toward building a future for myself. I love the craft and the creativity, but some days it’s incredibly hard to stay motivated when everything feels unstable and emotionally heavy. I’m grieving someone I moved here for, while also trying not to let my life completely unravel.\n\nI guess I’m just trying to figure out how people do this — how you process loss while being forced to grow up fast ( just turned 27 yesterday ) , relocate fast, and keep showing up for your goals.

His recovery took almost two weeks, and for a while it genuinely didn’t seem like he was going to make it.\n\nI have two sisters, and the whole situation quickly turned into what felt like a competition over who was “doing the most,” which honestly made everything harder to process.\n\nMy sisters are normally toxic, but during this time they took it to an extreme. I’m only 20, I had just lost my job, and I was in the middle of finals for college. I couldn’t be at the hospital nonstop and would have to leave for classes and come back, but I was still trying to show up however I could.\n\nAt one point in the hospital, one of my sisters got in my face and told me I shouldn’t even be there, that I was worthless and taking up space someone else deserved. She kept escalating until I pushed her away, and she ended up slapping me. I ran out, completely overwhelmed. My mom said it was “between us,” and my other sister sided with her, saying I deserved it because I wasn’t helpful enough. I’ve never felt so alone in my life.\n\nMy mom has always enabled this kind of behavior because she never does anything, which is why my sisters have felt comfortable treating me like that for years. Honestly what she said that day is what she says often regardless of the situation. Since then, my relationship with them has become completely estranged. They’re very narcissistic people and diagnosed bipolar, and this situation was the final push that made me emotionally cut them off even though I still live in the same house.\n\nThe hardest part of all of this has been my dad. He went without oxygen for a period of time, so there’s clear brain damage we just don’t know how severe. He isn’t the same person anymore. He barely talks. When I try to talk to him, it doesn’t feel like my dad. He used to joke constantly and say the most random things. But now he doesn’t say anything just smiles.\n\nI know he’s physically here, but it feels like the person I knew is gone. I feel incredibly guilty admitting this, but I think I started mourning him even though he’s still alive. Some days I’m scared to see him because it just reminds me that he’s not who he used to be. I feel terrified and alone around him, and then awful for feeling that way.\n\nHe was the only normal person in my family. Even with his addiction, he was the only one who defended me, who cared about me. I feel betrayed and heartbroken that he put us in this situation, angry that he made that choice, and devastated that I feel like he left me. Sometimes I even feel guilty for thinking it might have been easier if he had died, because then I wouldn’t be reminded every day that the dad I loved is gone.\n\nI miss my daddy so much. I just don’t know how to cope with losing someone who’s still alive, and I feel completely alone. It’s also just hard to visit in general because of my relationship with my sisters.

Elle est le résultat d’un empilement : une enfance sans structure solide, une transmission familiale non réparée, et un monde actuel incapable d’accueillir ou de contenir ce qui déborde.\n\nJe n’ai pas grandi dans un environnement garant.\n\nLes adultes censés protéger, sécuriser, poser des limites claires et offrir un socle émotionnel stable ne l’ont pas fait — non pas toujours par malveillance, mais par incapacité. Ils n’avaient eux-mêmes ni les ressources, ni la conscience, ni la guérison nécessaires. Alors l’enfant que j’étais a dû apprendre très tôt à se débrouiller seule, à comprendre avant d’être comprise, à s’adapter avant d’être soutenue.\n\nJe n’ai pas été tenue.\n\nJe n’ai pas été régulée.\n\nJe n’ai pas appris la sécurité intérieure, parce qu’elle ne m’a pas été transmise.\n\nCe manque de structure précoce laisse des traces profondes. Il ne s’efface pas avec le temps. Il façonne le rapport au monde, au corps, aux relations. On devient hypervigilante, fatiguée d’exister, toujours en train d’ajuster, d’anticiper, de compenser. L’identité se construit sur la survie, pas sur la confiance.\n\nÀ cela s’ajoute la dimension familiale et transgénérationnelle.\n\nJe porte quelque chose qui ne commence pas avec moi. Une histoire faite de silences, de renoncements, de douleurs non dites, de rôles figés. Ma mère, et les femmes avant elle, ont tenu sans être soutenues. Elles ont survécu sans être réparées. Et ce qui n’a pas été transformé s’est transmis — non par les mots, mais par les attitudes, les peurs, les absences, les injonctions à être forte.\n\nJ’ai hérité d’une loyauté invisible : celle de ne pas m’effondrer, de comprendre, de contenir, de ne pas demander trop. Me choisir a longtemps ressemblé à une trahison. Exister pleinement, à un danger.\n\nEt aujourd’hui, je me heurte à un monde relationnel profondément immature.\n\nLes relations manquent de profondeur, de responsabilité émotionnelle, de capacité à soutenir l’autre sans le fuir ou l’écraser. Beaucoup de personnes fonctionnent encore depuis leurs blessures non reconnues, leurs mécanismes de défense, leur peur de l’intimité réelle. Il y a peu de place pour la lenteur, pour la réparation, pour la vulnérabilité vraie.\n\nLa société actuelle ne guérit pas.\n\nElle exige d’avancer, de performer, de s’adapter, même quand les fondations intérieures sont fissurées. Elle individualise la souffrance, la psychologise, la médicalise parfois, mais elle refuse de questionner les structures qui la produisent : familles non contenantes, systèmes indifférents, relations jetables, absence de réel soutien collectif.\n\nJe me sens souvent en décalage.\n\nNon pas parce que je serais « trop », mais parce que je vois ce qui ne tient pas. Parce que je ressens ce qui n’est pas réparé. Parce que je cherche du sens, de la cohérence, de la vérité, dans un monde qui préfère la surface et l’évitement.\n\nMa souffrance est existentielle.\n\nElle naît de l’absence de base, de l’impossibilité de se reposer dans des relations fiables, et de la violence douce d’un système qui demande aux individus de se réparer seuls, sans jamais garantir les conditions de cette réparation.\n\nJe n’écris pas pour me plaindre.\n\nJ’écris pour nommer.\n\nEt peut-être aussi pour rencontrer quelqu’un qui reconnaîtra cette réalité — quelqu’un qui a grandi sans structure, qui a dû être adulte trop tôt, et qui cherche aujourd’hui un espace où l’on peut enfin être humain, sans devoir encore survivre.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qn0wdn/quand_ni_la_famille_ni_la_société_ne_sont_garantes/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qn0wdn/quand_ni_la_famille_ni_la_société_ne_sont_garantes/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Maybe because tonight I did it again sat in that half-empty theater row way at the back so no one has to look at me too long. Popcorn bucket on the empty seat next to me like it's pretending to be someone. Lights go down, movie starts, and for two hours I can pretend I'm not repulsive. That I'm just a normal person enjoying something normal people do. But credits roll, lights come up, and reality hits. I shuffle out past couples holding hands, groups laughing, girls my age smiling at guys who aren't me. Hoodie up, head down, hoping no one notices the fat guy who came alone again. Hoping no one thinks poor thing or worse, nothing at all. I do the same with food. Last week at that little place I like, I ordered the meal for two because why not twist the knife, right? Corner table facing the wall so I don't catch reflections or stares. Waiter asks if anyone's joining. I mumble no face burning. Ate in silence scrolling my phone to look busy, not lonely. But I wasn't busy. I was just trying not to cry into my plate. Every solo date rips something open. Deep down I know why I'm alone. It's not I like my own company. It's because no one wants to be seen with me. No one wants to sit across from this face, this body. Mirror shows the double chin that won't go away, skin that looks wrong, eyes that vanish when I rarely smile. I want what everyone else has so badly it physically hurts. Someone to share popcorn with. Someone to laugh at dumb scenes with. Someone to walk out holding hands, not pretending the empty seat was planned. Someone who looks at me and doesn't flinch. Someone who chooses me. But I'm convinced it'll never happen. So I keep doing these things alone. If I stop, I have literally nothing. At least this way I taste good food, see good stories, feel something briefly. Even if every bite tastes like failure. Even if every scene reminds me I'm watching other people's lives while mine stays stuck. Does anyone else feel this? The loneliness like a weight on your chest that never lifts? Screaming inside with no sound? Invisible except when taking up too much space?\n\nIf you've cried in a dark theater, stared at your food wishing someone was across from you, or just get this ache please say something. Even one me too would mean the world right now. I'm tired of pretending it's fine.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qlff62/anyone_else_here_whos_used_to_go_on_solo_dates/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qlff62/anyone_else_here_whos_used_to_go_on_solo_dates/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Well i didn't want to show how weak i was in a family where everyone else was able to stand straight and go forward. So i hid, for 23 years, until i met that girl online on a roleplay server. We matched, instantly, we are now best friends and we see each other from time to time since she lives 400km away...

I hurt people around me, especially my friend who i talk to every day, non stop, the pressure on her shoulders is getting too much, so today, i decided to take a few steps back and take time for myself, well that's what i told her.

I was there for a year. I came back to India and went to Japan again in march 2025 and I had to leave my toxic ass job because it totally broke me. I left Japan in October 2025.\n\nI have gotten a new job and I will probably go to Japan in a month or so.\n\nNow coming to the point, I don’t have any friends or any close person I can trust or talk or hang out with. I have one friend (will call him max) and he will be in India when I go back to Japan.\n\nI have a boyfriend who lives in Japan (will call him bob)\n\nI have struggled to get along with people all my life. The problem is, I always have felt like an outsider in any group. And my boyfriend for some reason never invites me to any of the gatherings or group activities he does with his group. He goes skiing, he plays badminton twice a week, he goes out to group dinners, he goes out for other people’s birthdays and their house warmings. Never once he has invited me. Turns out his friends sometimes ask him to bring his girlfriend. Now I am in India so I can’t go but once when I was in Japan, he just told me that a girl has invited everyone over and she has asked him to take me as well. He told her that I am not going without even concerning me first. That’s not how a relationship works right? I don’t wanna be too in love that I ignore all of that.\n\nHe once did a really shameful gay like act (which I am not comfortable sharing here) while everyone was celebrating his birthday (2 nights before his birthday) and I just stormed off of that place. He tried to convince me to stay for 2 whole minutes and went back and partied whole night. I could have never be able to do that if my boyfriend was that upset. I was crying the whole night while he was partying hard. So making friends with that group is gone.\n\nNow, my highschool best friend who was friends with me for 9 years stopped talking to me once without explaining why she was doing it.\n\nI tried to make friends with international students from my university. They were good friends with me for 1 month and then suddenly stopped inviting me to their plans and outings. I finally got an Indian girl in my university and she made friends with those international students but left me there.\n\nI have more and more such incidents.\n\nI have social anxiety, I struggle with panic attacks and probably clinical depression. I have never been diagnosed because no psychologist takes me seriously. I am into therapy and that’s the only thing keeping me alive.\n\nThe trigger to write this post was, my boyfriend again told me that he is going out somewhere with his friends in Feb again and obviously just told me. Didn’t try to invite me. And mind you there are couples in his friends group so no, its not about us being the only couple there. I don’t get it. Why wouldn’t my boyfriend wanna invite me to go out with him.\n\nHe didn’t invite me to his birthday night because his friends were coming over. I never got a chance to get over this fact but why doesn’t he wanna invite me?\n\nWhat’s so wrong with me that I am not good with people? Is that why I can’t make any friends? Is that the reason I am alone?\n\nI am seriously struggling here and I would appreciate genuine advice on how you guys make friends.

I just needed to let it out", "selftext": "It’s been such a heavy day, and I honestly need a place to let this all out. I don’t expect a solution; I want to be heard.\n\nOver the last two weeks, I (20M) have started talking to a girl I really like. She made my days feel brighter, gave me something to look forward to, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like there was a spark. We had a date planned (I mentioned this on another post I made here on Reddit), we were texting every day, and I genuinely thought things were going somewhere. But all of that suddenly fell apart, and it’s left me completely crushed.\n\nToday was rough already. Swim practice didn’t go well, classes drained me, and emotionally, I just felt wrecked. Not to mention, 3-2 days prior, I just had my grandmother's funeral, and it was so emotionally challenging. But what hit me the hardest was this situation with her. It feels like everything I was excited about just disappeared in front of me. I know we hadn’t even met yet, but I poured so much of my heart into those conversations because they felt real.\n\nNow it just feels like I’m 0-6 in my entire dating life. I’ve never even been on a real date. I watch people around me with their partners while I feel stuck, unwanted, overlooked, and left behind. I’m trying to keep my head up, I really am. But it’s exhausting. Some people make dating look so easy, and yet here I am, feeling like the universe is just laughing at me.\n\nIf anyone’s made it through something like this… how did you keep going? Because right now, I’m just trying to catch my breath.\n\nThanks for letting me share.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qd3ml6/mentally_drained_and_defeated_i_just_needed_to/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1qd3ml6/mentally_drained_and_defeated_i_just_needed_to/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Ignore if you see this.", "selftext": "I'm so done with life but not in a suicidal way... Its just last time there used to be many games, many choices to download which from the appstore and in multilayer ones where you are actually forced to communicate with people is fun...its actually pretty fun and a good experience to have... Whether it's negative or positive. It all builds up our Charecter...and slowly by time I learned to be grateful for it. Fuck, as dramatic as I'm saying this but I have to admit... I'm being really genuine...because I was so grateful for it, that's how i found my first love. Unlike games in this new generation where everyone just plays alone... Like genshin impact, cookie run kingdom all that famous games which are mostly just a single player game... Yes the games like genshin impact has multilayer but its just not the same as the old games where we join guilds and defeat mobs together as a team because we had to. Genshin has a multilayer as a choice and even if it can bring people together, it's not by game force, they can choose who to hang out with. And when they hang out with strangers they are always close minded. Majority. Because they are not really being pressured into getting to know strangers online of course. If I'm sounding wrong then what I mean in simpler ways is that, we don't communicate much in these types of multiplayer games. Sometimes it's for our own benefits like asking them to help you with something but not going together as a team...cookie run and cookie run kingdom is even worse, most of the guild members barely talk to one another. Those games are the best examples of how this gen of people playing in multiplayer has been. I understand that its probably for the best because of games like that last time kinda pressure you into talking to your guild members about how to fight back then don't matter the age which can cause a pedophile drama...sometimes you fall in love with the wrong one. I get it. But at this point of generation, get used to it, suck it up and try to be more fucking mature next time. I this situation, everyone has choices, so if you choose to get harrased online then it's none of my fucking business. Speaking of pedophiles, I do understand that they are a lot of victims out there who are treated poorly by them of course but pedophiles online is a different story. Us as humans as underage humans of course our parents have thought us never speak to strangers and that implys online too so if a stupid immature human being got themselves into that situation then great job maybe you DO need to build up more of your Charecter. I understand how it can make your mental stability poor enough to sometimes drag yourself to kill yourself but you know what. There's too much human on this earth anyways. Other people have other important matters to focus too. And some humans are fucking selfish enough to only consider their own thoughts and not thinking anything else about it and make themselves fall into deppresion well womp womp because other people are saving lives, having war, saving their own home. there's a lot more important shit to worry in this world, especially education and yet human beings care so fucking much for their emotions these days. Pathetic. I miss the old games so fucking much until I'm talking about literal life right now...Gosh... Heh...and the fact that there will be uneducated/immature ass's disagreeing with me on this just because it doesn't match up to their own understanding of the how the world is and their preferences or not understanding that strangers have different experiences and own learnings. God. I actually hope for a natural disaster so big to happen that it can wipe out all of mankind.

I'm an introvert and these are basically my only friends since 8th grade, but now everything's blown up and they're all turning on me. I need advice on how to handle this because I feel like total crap and don't know if I should just ghost them all or what. Sorry if this is long, but I'll try to explain from the beginning.\nBack in 8th grade, I had a huge crush on a classmate. It lasted like 8 months, and I told my school friends about it. But to my friends outside of school (town friends), I exaggerated and said she was my actual girlfriend. Dumb kid stuff, I know. Anyway, my school friends ended up telling her I liked her, and she confronted me after school with them around  she straight-up slapped me in front of everyone. My school friends even joined in abusing me. After that, I never talked to her again.\nThen in 9th grade, during sports day, she was in a running event. I pointed her out to a friend like \"look, she's running,\" and he yelled to everyone that I was saying \"my girl is running.\" He told her too, and right after the race, she came over and kicked me in front of the whole playground. Humiliating as hell. Lockdown hit after that, schools reopened in 11th, but we never interacted again through 12th, and school ended.\n(PS: After the slap incident, a girl moved into my neighborhood, and I developed a real crush on her  like, my first true love, but it was totally one-sided. She never liked me back, and we have no contact now. But at the time, I told my town friends that my \"school GF\" broke up with me and this new girl was my GF. Again, total lie, but I was young and stupid.)\nFast forward to now: I'm in college in another city (same as my town friends, but mine's online and different course, so they never see me on campus). We meet up at rooms sometimes. During winter break, we all came back to town, and I went to my village for my cousin sister's wedding. Her family is rich, so I posted stories on Insta of her dad's cars and the fancy lifestyle, just showing off I guess.\nWhen I got back, one of my town friends who goes to the gym randomly met some of my old school friends there. The school friends spilled everything about the school crush  how she slapped me, that she was never my GF, all the embarrassing details. Then my town/college friends shared the story about my neighbor \"GF\" with him too (he didn't know it was fake either). Now the whole group knows I lied about both \"relationships,\" and they're calling me one by one or in group calls, laughing and bullying me nonstop. Calling me a fake guy, a liar, saying I show off a fake rich lifestyle, that I'm a loser who got slapped, I'll never amount to anything, always stay poor, etc.\nIt's hitting hard because I'm introverted and these are my only friends. Even if they \"cool down,\" I know they'll bring this up forever  any time they're bored or want to roast someone, I'll be the easy target. Idk what to do. Should I just fully disappear from their lives? Block them everywhere, ghost, don't pick up calls, delete my Insta and make a new one? Or is there a way to fix this? Has anyone been in a similar spot with friends exposing old lies and turning toxic?

I held myself back through October, November, and December. Every night, I typed his name and deleted it. But on January 3rd, at 1:47 AM, I couldn’t stop myself anymore. I texted him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj058w4hugbg1.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e96f2717e15f8cf8c29506affc50b4eb1b0c5eb\n\nHe replied.\n\nIn that moment, I can’t even explain what I felt. I had a thousand questions and a thousand things to say, but instead of all that, I was just.... happy. He wished me Happy New Year and asked me how I was doing, how my business was going, about my career and my college. He remembered **everything**. Even the song I once shared with him.... he still had it.\n\nAfter all the formal talk, he asked me something I was scared of hearing. \n\n“So… are you still single, or did you find someone?” \n\nI said no, still single. \n\nThen I asked him the same question. \n\nHe said yes.\n\nI asked him if it was a guy or a girl. \n\nHe replied, “Why don’t you flip a coin?” \n\nI said no. I didn’t want to play games.\n\nI wanted the truth. He said.... **a guy**.\n\nI couldn’t express what I felt. I held my tears for a few seconds.... and then I broke. \n\nI replied, “Haha… good for you.” \n\nThen I asked if I could see him, the lucky one. \n\nHe said he would need to ask him first. \n\nI replied, “Haha okay.” But inside, I was right back where I was in 2024.... crying again.\n\nI asked him what he would say if his partner asked who I was. \n\nHe said, “The truth. A guy I met on Tinder.” \n\nI asked what he would do if he was told to block me. \n\nHe replied, “I will immediately.” \n\nAnd honestly.... I appreciated his loyalty.\n\nI asked him for one last thing before blocking me. \n\nI said, “Before blocking me, please give me one last reply.... ‘Goodbye, Parth.’” \n\nWe talked from around **4 AM** for almost **two hours**. He told me I would find someone. But how was I supposed to say that I didn’t want someone new? So I laughed it off and said, “Haha… yes.”\n\nHe caught me again. He said, “Don’t hide emotions behind silly words. I know you’re crying.” He knew me that well.\n\nI asked him one last question.... what did I do wrong to lose you? \n\nWe shared the same name.... **Mannu**. \n\nHe replied, “**Destiny can be the same, but that doesn’t mean the paths are the same too,** **Parth.”** \n\nAnd once again.... I had no reply. The great philosopher.\n\nThat’s when I finally accepted the truth. He’s never coming back.

Not a single person knows this side of me.\n\nI am bisexual.... more into guys.... and I’ve known it since I was growing up. In school, I felt attracted to girls.... but also to boys. At first, I thought it was just confusion. In college, it became clearer. I would notice guys, think about them in ways I couldn’t explain, and then feel guilty for those thoughts.\n\nI stayed confused for years.\n\nIn 2023, I finally decided to accept that part of myself. I didn’t even know things like “top” or “bottom.” I was that unaware i watched por.n and i loved it too then. I made my first Tinder profile, got no matches, deleted the app, reinstalled it again in April 2024.... and that’s when I met **him**.\n\nHe was different....\n\nMature. Calm. Intelligent. He spoke like someone older, wiser.... almost philosophical. Romantic in a quiet way. We talked for hours. Shared pictures. Voice calls. Video calls. I was working, so time was limited, but we still made it work.\n\nWe even shared the same name.... **Mannu**.  \nHe used to call me **Parth**. like god krishna says and that sounds mesmerized\n\nFor six months.\n\nWe never shared nudes. Not once. He sent a shirtless picture once, but that was it. What we shared was something deeper.... conversations, comfort, connection.\n\nAnd slowly.... I fell in love.\n\nI had a girlfriend before, but I never felt this safe, this understood, this seen. With him, I felt like myself for the first time in my life.\n\nWe never met in person. Just chats, calls, video calls. But somehow, he felt more real than anyone I had ever met face-to-face.\n\nSometimes he would say things so deep, so thoughtful, that I wouldn’t even know how to reply. He was a philosopher in my eyes.\n\nThen one day.... he stopped replying.\n\nNo display picture on WhatsApp. No clear sign if I was blocked or not. I kept checking. Waiting. Overthinking.\n\nAnd then.... one day before Diwali.... he replied.\n\nIt was around 4 PM. I was in the office. We talked for two hours like nothing had happened. and I was in the office. We talked for two hours like nothing had happened. At the end, he said, **“This is the end.”** My world collapsed.\n\nI couldn’t cry there. I was surrounded by people. I asked him why, begged him to give me a reason, told him I didn’t deserve this silence.\n\nHe replied, **“People are not things that you deserve or don’t deserve.”** Even while breaking my heart, he spoke like a philosopher. That evening was dark, heavy, black. After spending 2 hrs, I told him, “You will always be my real love. I will never text you again.” And I didn’t.\n\nMy colleagues noticed something was wrong and asked me what happened, but I couldn’t tell anyone. How could I say I loved a guy? How could I say I’m bisexual? How could I explain a breakup that never officially existed? I went into depression for months. I cried under my blanket at night. I screamed silently. I felt numb at work. Everyone was worried, but no one knew the truth.\n\nThe last thing he said to me still echoes in my head\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n**“Love yourself before loving me, Parth.**\n\n**Find someone who will be there for you. Or maybe one day I’ll wake up, text you and ask....**\n\n**‘Are you single?’**\n\n**And you’ll say yes.”**\n\nI waited....\n\nNot days.  \nNot months.\n\nYears.\n\nHe never texted.\n\nI tried to find someone else. I really did. But I never found that connection again. That comfort. That feeling of being home.\n\nI’m still here. Still healing. Still carrying a love I was never allowed to talk about.\n\nAnd this.... is the first time I’ve ever said it out loud. and crying again...\n\nI held myself back through October.  \nThrough November.  \nThrough December.\n\nEvery day I typed his name and deleted it.\n\nAnd then, on **January 3**, I finally broke.\n\nI texted him again.\n\nWhat happened after that made this story even bigger, heavier, and more complicated than before.\n\nI can’t fit it all here.\n\nSo this is **Part 1**.\n\nI’ll explain everything in **Part 2**.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1q4d25y/part_1_i_am_bi_its_painful_i_loved_a_guy_in/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1q4d25y/part_1_i_am_bi_its_painful_i_loved_a_guy_in/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I have BPD, depression, and anxiety, and through high school I was in and out of school; slowly all the “friends” I made disappeared and left me behind. So I don’t have really any friends, two including my long-distance boyfriend. He provides me a lot of comfort, but he’s traveling and busy with friends, so it’s been pretty quiet, and it sets me into panic. I really tried to make plans with my friend to distract from this sadness and let go, but she would rather be going out with her other friends. I can’t remember the last time I felt carefree and was just having a blast and forgetting my problems for one day. I feel so selfish for getting upset at those around me; I hate to come across as “woe is me” and “I have it so horrible” when I know there are bigger problems out there. It just feels so heavy on my heart; :( I feel like a loser. I'm 19 (20 in May), and growing up, I had such a picturesque imagination of how becoming a teenager would be… going out with friends, partying, laughing, living life to the fullest and I just feel so robbed of this experience I wanted so badly. I know I'm catastrophizing this whole situation, but I just wish I was somebody else for this day; it hurts too much to be in my skin.

I have, since the day I was born, lived in a house which had one of my maternal uncles as a permanent house guest, along with my parents. Since he was not financially in a position to buy his own home, he was always there. No rent, just family. \n\nThen he got married and my aunt entered. And soon thereafter my baby cousins.\n\nFast forward a couple of decades, the kids have grown up, are married and now have children of their own (at the very least one does). I, too, got married in this time period and now a double story house fit for one family is being occupied by four families. \n\nAn uncle and an aunt, a cousin with his wife and two children, and the other cousin with his wife. I am also there with my wife, however my parents have since long passed on.\n\nI also have 8 cats between the ages of 1 and 3.\n\nNow that's a full house. And naturally, as with most full houses, comes up with its own territorial issues and the periodic drama. \n\nSignificantly, after my parents, the house is now within my ownership.\n\nWhen I was about to get married, things were reorganized in the house. Rooms were exchanged. Lines were drawn. I had my own area on the top floor. There were common areas. There were private rooms.\n\nThe dispute tonight concerned a common area shared by my cousin with his wife along with me and my wife.\n\nThe area in question is 6'x10'. On one side (against a wall), they (cousin and wife) have two sets of wardrobes and drawers. On the other is an area my wife and I use to store shoes and laundry.\n\nThe dispute concerned the upkeep of our side. \n\nThe dispute, before tonight, had been nagging at best, which was often addressed there and then and often, admittedly, not so addressed. This was often met with passive aggression like our things being clumped together or thrown on top of each other (in what only manifestly worsened the aesthetics of the area). I understand that the aesthetic of our side was not as per their taste but things were mostly in place and needless to emphasize the passive aggressive interference was uncalled for. It was not responded to (which is where perhaps I erred). And things remained mostly civil.\n\nToday, my cousin approaches me and informs me, point blank, that he had had enough of the situation and that he needed a date by when the mess (fair to call it that since it had gotten messy) will be removed.\n\nI informed him, calmly, that I got tidy up the place but that I could not remove everything.\n\nFirstly, it was my part of the common area, secondly, I did not have space in my private space. The conversation escalated from his end. He tried to emotionally manipulate me by bringing up my late father (haven't heard him bring the man up in over a year or so). He said that things had deteriorated with his wife to the point of divorce because of our mess.\n\nThat this was the reason he wasn't trying for children and how that was my fault.\n\nHeated though the conversation was there was a point that I did honestly believe we had a resolution. He suggested a cabinet setup. I agreed since I had been thinking along the same lines.\n\nI don't know what happened. Perhaps he didn't expect me to agree? But the next thing he says is \"Yeah but why can't you move the stuff in your private area?\".\n\nWe can't because we have cats and we genuinely don't have the space.\n\nThe argument got so heated that our wives intervened and we both wked away from the conversation.\n\nHe and I have not spoken since. That is what made me feel \"lonely\" the first time.\n\nNow, my other cousin, who does often tend to moderate between me and him elected not to on this occasion. He and I have not even spoken since the fight. We ran into each other at one point after but both elected not to engage. I had before this, tried to reach him on phone, which missed call he never returned. This made me feel lonely for the second time.\n\nNow, we come to my wife. She has autism and ADHD. She does not clean, not even after her own self, on most occasions. We all have work lives. We still try to juggle if not balance home life with it.\n\nShe has not been able to find that balance in the two years we have been married. \n\nShe has gone through personal loss recently, comes from an abusive household she had to emancipate from yet finds herself intricately intertwined with. Our marriage has not been the best either for various reasons and most days it's literally like living with a messy roommate. \n\nTo her credit, she stood up for me in the argument (even though I didn't ask) and her intervention did break an aggravating encounter. \n\nShe is also partly to blame for the alleged \"mess\". Part of it was her. Part of it was mine.\n\nI, for my part, elected to clean up the mess. It took me 3 hours. She helped. On her own accord. However, when we got done and had to decide on dinner she threw a hissy fit and said fuck dinner I'm off to sleep. \n\nNow that's not too bad in most cases. But I've been with her all day and she had not had more than half a plate of rice all day. And she's diabetic.\n\nAfter a number of failed attempts, I asked her, point blank, what purpose this served. She said that was her problem.\n\nThat was the third time I felt lonely tonight.\n\nExhausted from the day, the rigors of the past few hours and the emotional turmoil that a failing marriage (maybe two at this point if one were to take my cousin's word to be the gospel truth?), a kitten with a failing liver and a house in distress, I thought for a moment.\n\nWho could I talk to about this? Who could I seek advice from? Not a single person came to mind.\n\nFourth time I felt lonely tonight.\n\nI went through my contacts list. Still without an answer.\n\nFifth time.\n\nAnd then I realised. That the sinking sensation I had been feeling since the encounter was not loneliness.\n\nI felt alone. \n\nI did not (nor do I presently) feel lonely. I have 8 cats. I have been \"on my own\" longer.

I think the ones I've talked to more just aren't the best. I've been mistreated and ignored even though this one particular person was obligated to help or even respond as a classmate. The drama here and there about anything is the norm, yet I was judged for what they think I did for reasons they haven't even asked me about personally like an actual friend would.\n\nIf they know so much about how I'm a bad person, why not say it up-front so I don't \"bother\" them because I'm oblivious of their resentment? She preaches beliefs more than she listens.\n\nWhat about all that drama the whole batch knows about her? That could actually be true because there have been some signs? Like showing attraction to a guy while both of them were in separate relationships? Or having an ex bf who used her social media account to dm a muslim classmate and asking if she was a virgin? Worse part is this girl didn't even apologize to that classmate for what happened.\n\nOur bond didn't last long cus I got ticked off after she didn't return something of mine then I blew it all off after the joke that I was seeing someone, in our campus we're not allowed to publicize romantic relationships at all so I could've been in trouble.\n\nAs for friend 2, he erased the self-esteem I built up all summer break in a few months. The pessimism rubbed onto me and I went into a spiral, I've tried talking but he prefers to preach as well while I stay quiet. He also complains about being self-conscious while wanting me to be in the same boat by insulting me in subtle ways disguised as genuine concern.\n\nThere's actually a friend 3, see it gets confusing because they're genuinely kind and helpful but seems to have underlying passive aggression? We've been on and off, and I actually can't handle it any longer because there's always a good chance she won't respond to me. Yet when I need time off they can just hit me up and get upset when I'm not willing to talk. Sometimes I think I'm too much for anyone, because they won't listen nor reciprocate.\n\nI don't talk to any of them as often since I landed in technically homeschool due to an incident mentioned before. And when they do attempt to talk, I purposefully end the conversation. When I have to, I plainly react an emoji on their dm then call it a day. I'm so fed up. I don't want to talk to anyone and they 100% won't see me next year because I won't be applying for college until the next application season.\n\nThey aren't worth it. I don't even get excited when they reach out or when I see them in person. I want to pick myself out of their lives so no one will be bothered by me ever again. I'm not enough of a friend for them anyway and they never handled me from the beginning, I say too many things and when I happen to correct them I'm just overlooked.\n\nTo be seen is to be loved, okay? They don't even have much of a good memory, not for me.

It was all started when I shifted to another school in another city. I was in 6th standard. I was shocked to see students were using brutal and explicit language at such a young age. Some of them were doing vulgar acts at the backbench. Of course I was bullied because I was new in that class. I used to sit alone in the corner. Then I met a boy and he became my best friend. He used to came at my home with his bicycle. But that days of happiness didn't last too long. He left this world when I was in 7th standard. And I was left alone from that day. I met some students but I couldn't say they were my friends. Days passed and I somehow managed to come in 11th standard. I took science as a subject but that didn't turn out good. My chemistry teacher started belittling me for no reason. One day I was sitting at the front bench and he said \"Only those who are intelligent students must be allowed to sit at the front bench. You much sit at the backbench. You are poor in studies\". And every time he belittled students used to laugh. I was good at maths and my maths teacher also appreciated me. My classmates started hating me except some students. They all made a separate whatsapp group where they used to share notes and study materials. I was not allowed to join. Group admin who made that group said \"I only want active students\". Everyone except me joined the group. I passed 11th and 12th standards somehow. Then started my college days. My classmates were not like the ones I met before during my school days. They were different. I started seeing a hope like having to see good friendship. But again It was totally  different from what I was expecting. I dont know in what language do I tell you. When you are friends, you stroll together,eat together and enjoy together. That wasn't the case with me. They used to ditch me. I was a third wheel between them.When i talk to one of them he avoids me and talks to some other friend. It felt like a invisible person where you are there but not there. Same thing happened yesterday. It was no coincidence.

I was under the impression these thoughts were pretty regular until I recently shared them with a friend about a month ago.\n\nsorry for bad punctuation im hoping the commas are sufficient but im pretty lazy and its 5:30am, i messed my sleep schedule back up right after i fixed it again 🫩.\n\nalso if you have questions or wanna talk or anything go crazy ill respond to everything assuming i dont delete this app cuz i try to stay off socials but even if i do ill reinstall and respond at some point.\n\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1pfmddh/ive_been_depressedkinda_suicidal_since_i_was_12/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1pfmddh/ive_been_depressedkinda_suicidal_since_i_was_12/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I have chronic depression, which of course contributes, but I am PLAGUED by a CONSTANT absence of motivation and optimism, and frequently feel a strong sense of loathing, both of myself and the world. For as long as I can remember I've never really felt like I had REAL friends. I always ended up being that person nobody really cares about. Excluded, the \"odd 1 out\", and I've just been in fake friend group after fake friend group. I've probably been insulted more in my life than I've recieved compliments, and hardly anyone has expressed interest in or attraction to me. I have maybe 4 close friends, but we almost never talk or hang out, and whenever anything is going on, I always find out from social media or someone else mentioning it. I've spent most of my life not being considered for activities, or invited places, and also just straight up being rejected. I've also frequently been the target for bullying and being picked on, including by my family, who also for some reason never side with me during an argument or debate, always equate my concern to being paranoid, rarely take me seriously, and tease me about being \"dramatic\". I struggle badly socially, and have pretty serious trust issues caused by all my experiences growing up. I don't think I'm a bad person, I actually think I might be pretty decent, but nobody has ever wanted to put a real effort into having any kind of meaningful friendship or relationship with me. \"Friends\" I had for years never seemed concerned at all about anything I was struggling with, and usually when I shared things, either nobody cared, or they just wouldn't believe me. I've been laughed at during my moments of distress, like when I had a period accident in class in highschool, or when I got painful bug bites all over my legs while outside in 8th grade. I literally freaked out and sobbed, and I had welts that all swelled together, but for some reason when I told my \"friends\" the next day, they told me I didn't actually have big bites, and acted like I was lying(like, sure, the most socially anxious person you know, made a fool of themself just for the fun of it🙄). I've never personally seen anyone treated the way I've been growing up, and people even have a different response when I experience the same issues as other people. I would literally cut people off cold turkey, and they wouldn't even ask me why. It would be as if it never mattered if I was there or not, even though I've expressed empathy and been considerate to them. Even after I became an adult, I would watch groups of kids and teens from my bedroom window with envy, wishing I could have had what they do, and wondering what's wrong with me that I never seem to be able to. People always seems to have an indifferent, or adverse response to my presence, and I've spent the vast majority of lunches at school alone, and now also free time in adulthood. More often than not, I feel like an inconvenience, a burden, and I have been told that before. Because of that, I can almost never ask anyone for help, and when I do, it's just another thing I feel like shit about later.\n\nEvery time I look back on my life, I just see a bunch of rejection, embarrassment, loneliness, lies, and regret. Even memories that should be good are tainted by self hate and inner conflict. I've only experienced genuine pride in myself a few times in my entire life.\nI can't stop stewing on why I'm so different from other people, why new factors just keep being added to my struggle, the fact that I am PAINfully lonely. I suffer from both dysphoria and dysmorphia with a conservative family. I always doubt myself, because it seems like no matter what I do, everything ends up being shitty anyway, and I question why the hell I did or said something in the furture.

It sucks that when I need to go to a museum or cinema, i see everybody being in groups.

When I moved on to secondary education, we drifted apart. We still lived in the same small town, but the connection faded. Sometimes I see him from a distance. I’m not sure if he notices me or remembers anything. Perhaps not. Perhaps I prefer not to know. I will not reach out; he could, if he wished. I don’t initiate contact with anyone.\n\nSolitude is intentional. Yet if someone appeared-someone intelligent, friendly, and capable of offering real challenge-I would respond in kind.\n\nPeople occasionally try to speak with me, and sometimes I feel the need to talk as well, briefly. Then the conversations end. Maybe I should be gentler. I turned twenty-five this year and had no friends beside me. At times I felt “lonely,” but being alone remains the most valuable thing I possess.\n\nThe noise of people-their agitation, their self-absorption, their inability to listen or remember-exhausts me.

But I can’t shake the feelings that our relationships are irrevocably changed and won’t ever be the same. And it’s really hard. I’m awful with change and have never been able to deal with it good. I try to reach out and give myself non-negotiables to avoid disappearing completely but I know the older we get the harder it can be to maintain relationships due to work, family, etc. \n\nMaybe I’m just a wuss who needs to face the music and get over myself.

Last couple of days have been a rollercoaster, and it’s getting harder to breathe without you beside me. Where I’m working, one of my closest friends — a Muslim brother to me — got married a few days back. All my batchmates were there. It felt like the old days for a moment. Some even came just to check on me, using the function as an excuse. And all I heard was, “You’re looking dead, eat something… everything will be fine.”\n\nWhen my best friend arrived, I hugged him for the first time in eight years. I don’t know what broke in me — I just cried on his shoulder. I opened every wound I’d been hiding, showed him how deep they were, how they’re still bleeding. Spending time with him and the others felt close to living again… but even in the loudest room, I missed you.\n\nLater we went to the hills for sunset — just me and him. And all we talked about was you. I told him everything, from the first moment to the last. For the first time, something felt lighter, as if someone had lifted a little weight off my chest. For the first time, we behaved like grown men. He supported me in a way I didn’t expect. He said he has faith in you… that things will settle… just that time is testing us.\n\nStanding at that sunset point, all I could think was — you would’ve loved this view.\nAnd then everyone left after the reception, but I stayed behind… alone again.\n\nThe next day they called me to the main office. All the officials were there. They spoke softly, almost too gently, asking if I was on antidepressants, asking personal questions — trying to understand my state of mind. And again, I couldn’t stop my tears. They told me, “You need to get back on your feet. Take these two months, work on yourself, come back stronger. Don’t worry about things here — we’ll handle them.”\n\nSo I’ve decided to prepare for my next competitive exam. Trying to study, trying to divert my mind. But you… you run in my head all day. When I sleep, I see you. When I open my eyes, the first thing I miss is you.\n\nEvery day I go to the park for a walk — one hour of songs, memories, and you. Sometimes I even talk to you like you’re walking beside me.\n\nI begged my uncle to talk to your dad. But he only said, “Our daughter is fine. She’s joined the family hospital. Stop disturbing us.” My uncle even told him my mental state isn’t good… still, he was firm, saying you’re ready to surrender.\n\nBut the girl I know… she doesn’t settle for less. I even smiled while writing this because I have more faith in you than I’ve ever had in myself.\n\nMissing you sucks… but how lucky am I to have someone worth missing this much.\n\nI hug my blanket like it’s you.\nI don’t know when or how love happened.\nI only know this much — it happened to you, it lives with you, and it will stay with you.\n\nWhat will I lose when I have you?\nWhat will I have when I lose you?\n\nWhen I come across something beautiful, the first voice in my head is yours.\n\nSometimes we don’t want to heal, because the pain is the last link to what we’ve lost.\n\nPlease never doubt my love. It’s the only thing I’m absolutely sure of.\n\nYou were that one person — my human medicine — who made everything feel better.\n\nThere’s a Turkish saying: If you truly love someone, you love them twice.\n\nThe first time is easy — the smile, the voice, the warmth. But then the illusion fades, and you start seeing the scars, the fears, the imperfections. And if you still love them — without filters, without conditions — that’s the kind of love that survives. The kind that deepens.\n\n“Mujhe bheja tha duniya dekhne ko,\nmain ek chehre ka ghulaam ban gaya.”\n\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1p87g15/you_were_my_calm_tide_now_i_drown_in_the_echoes/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1p87g15/you_were_my_calm_tide_now_i_drown_in_the_echoes/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I’m the youngest in the family of seven and good amount of friends a few years back and now i’m venting and going on many social platforms to try and find a way to deal or cope with my loneliness and feelings just bottle away for years due to me distracting myself with temporary happiness.\n\nBut now as i’m getting older and not a single person, family or friend genuinely checking on my mental well being besides a “Are you okay?” and it’s truly making me question what’s the point of all these relationships and bonds being built if at the end of the day i’m going to have to retreat to a forum to speak my feelings and thoughts? what’s the point of building friendships and staying close with family if all it ever brings is temporary happiness and a world full pain and sadness. It’s honestly feels like everybody had given up on me from the jump or has not truly cared or valued me at all. I’ve had some friends for 5-10+ years and yet not one even bothers to check up on me and it’s not like i haven’t shown signs of my mental not being okay, two years back after i experienced something traumatic and felt alone and had suicidal thoughts i turned to my friends, the people who’ve have been the only root of my happiness and literally out of a group of over 10 people only 4 even bothered to check up and the one person who’d id been friends with since kindergarten had time joked about it and didn’t bother to even check up after. And ever since i’ve been young i’ve always been shy and quiet but that had been due to the amount of trauma i had faced with my family and always feeling so small in a house of a mountain of problems, it made me develop a fear of rejection and an even worse fear of being screamed at or belittled. The fear rejection had stemed from not truly feeling loved by anyone but my mother many times as a child and eventually as i grew older it felt as if my mothers love had weakened causing me to isolate myself and pour everything into the very friends who’ve abandoned me.\n\nI’ve dealt with many addictions due to a lack of guidance, i’ve never looked up to anyone but my one brother who literally left my message on read as i attempted to vent to him and show my appreciation. And these addictions affect me so deeply especially since all the talent i’ve had was truly my intelligence and me being educated and yet due to feeling abandoned i’ve chased these small and temporary moments of pleasure and it feels like my brain is just so damaged, developing a 🌽,🍃, and food addiction all before 15, and i’ve only dug myself in a deeper whole as i’ve lost the only good thing i truly have.\n\nI’ve blamed myself for the way people treat me because at the end of the day it can’t be everybody else’s fault, but it’s truly made me dislike people and humans. I’ve been able to control my food addiction and better myself by trying to stay in shape and eat better but i always fall back into this void and cycle of digging myself into a deeper whole because everytime im focused it feels as if im lookin down and avoiding all my problems but as soon as i look up and face them it just consumes me again.\n\nWith girls I might’ve had a couple of girls take interest in me due to what i believe is my ability to not follow the crowd or the looks ive worked so desperately hard to achieve hoping it’d bring change and bring me new people. And yet nothing changed, even when im speaking to a high attractive girl and she finds interest in me as soon as we start talking in my head it’s evident im way more interested in them than they are in me because all i yearn for is love, and true human connection and honestly i feel as if thats the only thing that has truly made me happy.

It’s not like this isn’t yet another man pushing me out of his life after several previous relationships. I am convinced something is inherently wrong with me. I know my severe depression isn’t exactly welcomed in a relationship, but it seems like I’m always made to feel safe, to feel wanted and accepted despite my emotional hardships until it’s not. Whatever is going on in my partners life, whatever they may be feeling with or without my influence towards their life I’m ultimately pushed away and cast aside, I’m not something that they can deal with any longer, I am not worth keeping in the end it feels. But they tell me it’s not my fault, I’m not the issue, and yet I also can’t be let into their lives to be the supportive partner I should be, it’s easier just to throw me away. The promises didn’t actually matter, the hopes, supports and safety we established was all bullshit, just more empty sayings that ultimately added up to NOTHING. I am SO tired, I am SO hurt, and now I can’t even cry as much any more, it just comes out as anger. All I want is a life partner to love, to hold, to cherish, to care for. I try to give all of myself, emotionally, physically, mentally, but it’s all for nothing. These pieces of myself that I share, that I trust with my love and only them, add up to jackshit. It just feels like I’m going through a line of men to love, to fuck, and then to get ditched by. Therapy doesn’t and hasn’t helped me in these last couple years that my life really began to spiral from these relationships, I feel truly helpless and alone. Friends, family, and hobbies don’t fill the void. Friends don’t have time for my issues and I don’t blame them. I have sadly grown frustrated and uncomfortable around my family as I crave independence so I can’t share with them my pain, and even then, I don’t want to. Hobbies merely distract from the fact that what I crave most out of life continues to leave me feeling more broken and abandoned by the day. These things can’t love me or spend time with me as intimately as a partner should, they don’t complete my needs or hopes for a life worth living I’m sorry to say. I just want to share my life with that one special someone, but I’m at a point where I’m so sick I don’t even know my capabilities as a partner, if all that I do amounts to wrong. Am I just unlovable? Am I not meant to be loved long term? I don’t even think I know what a healthy relationship looks like, because I think I do until it’s gone.\n\nI miss my love, I want him in my life by my side, but he no longer desires me in his life. I know you are struggling, but what’s the point of making all these promises and hopes for the future when you aren’t willing to share the worst parts of it with me.

I’m not an ideal lover. God… I’m not perfect at anything. I’m not successful enough to not care about love, and I’m not loved enough to not care about success. I’m not attractive enough to be at peace with myself despite everything. I’m not optimistic enough to begin changing, and I’m not young enough to start over and rebuild everything.\n\nDid I fail myself, or did life fail me? Is there even an answer?

I told him that every day — at the start of our conversations and at the end when he had to leave. I always felt he didn’t reply with the same warmth, but I didn’t care as long as he was still there.\n\nHe consumed me completely. When I talked to him, I felt as if I were in another world, a reality entirely different from mine, a faraway place that didn’t resemble my own life. I was drowning in an illusion. He told me plainly, “Don’t get attached, one day I’ll leave,” but we do not choose when we fall in love or when we become attached.\n\nMaybe the fact that it was an online relationship should make the pain easier, but love is love no matter the medium. He left, and I don’t think he’ll ever return. And even if he did , would I go back to who I was? God, I loved him so much that in a strange way I’m almost relieved he’s gone. I used to hate myself before him, and I hated myself even more after he left. We will never be together again, not in this life. Maybe in another life. I will never love anyone the way I loved him… I wish he knew.\n\nBut he is not the whole story. Maybe his leaving was simply the last straw.

{"id": "1oy3tvn", "subreddit": "alone", "created_utc": 1763243081, "author": "Brief_Quarter8976", "title": "Corpse", "selftext": "I write to you on a sunny Saturday afternoon. It is two thirty-one PM. Seventy-five degrees, no clouds, winds barely brushing five miles per hour. By all accounts, a perfect day to be alive. The sounds of life drift through my windows — birds chirping, children laughing, cars humming past. But there is no life in me. No sound. No feeling. No passion. Nothing.\n\nI am dead.  \nI am nothing.\n\nI exist simply to watch others — to witness their joy, their warmth, their easy kinship — while remaining untouched by all of it. There is no Henry-only flesh over bone. Whatever I was is gone. What remains is hollow.\n\nMy mask of sanity slips a little more each day. Happiness sits just out of reach, like a child longing for the warmth of his mother’s arms. I yearn for joy. For belonging. For life. Yet somehow I am dead — breathing, eating, drinking, speaking — all signs of life without any of its feeling. I died many months ago.\n\nI see my friends out on the water, laughing on their forty-four-foot boat. I see my neighbors gathered outside, lost in their trivial conversations. I see my love somewhere out in the world, bright smile, surrounded by people who care for her. And here I sit alone. The room is dark, curtains drawn, the air stale and heavy. A tomb. A tomb for a corpse not yet rotting, but dead all the same.\n\nMaybe I lied. I do feel *something.* Not much — but one thing remains:  \nHate.\n\nA burning little flame that grows as my desire to live shrinks. I hate the world. I hate my friends. I hate my ex. And slowly, I feel that hatred spreading to everyone. But above all, I hate myself.\n\nLet me pause to be clear: **I am not a threat to anyone, including myself.** I’ve been through that. I’ve been locked away in a mental hospital before — it only strips away the few comforts that remain. Despite everything, I care deeply for people. I would still stop for a stranger and take him to the nearest inn. I hate hurting others. That is exactly why I hate myself so much: I hurt the person who mattered most to me.\n\nMy addiction destroyed my relationship with her. It was an addiction I carried since childhood — elementary school into middle school, then high school, and into my adult life. I didn’t understand its nature. I believed it was my friend, my comfort, my mistress. She was always there — when I was alone, when I was broken, when I had nothing else.\n\nThen I met Sol. A real her. A woman who felt like an angel, a cure, a light in the darkness. My passion for her made me abandon the mistress I’d held onto for so long. But over time, that mistress grew jealous. She came back with a vengeance. Soon I was torn between my love and my soulmate. But which was which? I still don’t know. Maybe Sol was my true love. Maybe my addiction was my soulmate. Either way, the two of them destroyed each other — and I’m the one left behind in the wreckage.\n\nSol lives. I don’t.\n\nI tell myself to be grateful. It could be worse. I still have my freedom, for now — knock on wood for me. But what is freedom to a corpse? What is the value of choice when the chooser is already dead? My sanity is like snow under the sun — present, but melting.\n\nYou know who I relate to? Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker. Not the homicidal monster — but the man who laughs because the only alternative is to cry. The man whose joy is a glitch in the system, whose laughter is a wound. I do that. I laugh at the absurdity of my despair. I laugh at the things I hate. I laugh because it’s the only thing left that feels real, even if it shouldn’t.\n\nSo maybe the answer is to learn how to be alone. But how does someone like me do that? I crave connection. I crave companionship. I crave love. How am I supposed to teach myself to be content in solitude? Is that even possible? Some people are born for it — Batman thrives in darkness. But I’m no Batman. I’m more like Superman — made for the sunlight, yet somehow I’ve locked myself away from it. No wonder I feel like a corpse. Doesn’t every dead man long to see the sun rise one last time?\n\nThe evidence piles up. With every word I write, I convince myself a little more that staying afloat feels pointless. I grow tired. I grow weary. The depths feel peaceful, almost inviting. Maybe the dead truly do walk the earth — beings who can move, speak, and breathe, yet feel nothing. I am one of them. Proof that a body can live long after the person inside it has died.\n\nI am dead.  \nI am nothing.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1oy3tvn/corpse/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1oy3tvn/corpse/", "over_18": true, "removed_by_category": null}

It’s been almost two weeks without contact, and these last few days have been unbearable.\n\nA few days ago, I had a small accident — my vision blurred with tears while driving.\nThen came the call from my main office; I was asked to meet the higher officials.

Life often feels empty and lonely. I see others sharing moments of happiness... spending time with loved ones, enjoying life’s simple pleasures... while I find myself disconnected and searching for meaning. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone truly sees me or cares. I've shared my struggles before, and honestly, life has sometimes felt like a series of hardships, teaching me lessons of pain rather than joy. The weight of loneliness and depression is heavy....like a shadow that never quite leaves me. I try to escape the darkness, even if just for a moment, but it never fully leaves me.\n\nRight now, I’m in a quiet forest, alone with my thoughts, writing this out of a deep sense of solitude. Life was brighter during school and college, when everything seemed full of possibility. But as I grew older, I chased success and money, only to find myself a slave to them... losing touch with happiness and genuine connection. I left behind a promising career at a big tech company to pursue my own venture, which grew but at a personal cost. The pursuit of success stole something precious from me: my joy. And despite all the achievements, I still feel empty inside....like I’ve lost the essence of who I am.\n\nLife feels fleeting, a brief chapter in the grand scheme. We spend so much of it working, earning, surviving... rules seemingly set to keep us busy but disconnected from what truly matters. Despite having stability, I still feel the ache of loneliness, of being unseen and unheard. Sometimes I visit cemeteries, reading the names, contemplating the brevity of life... some left too soon, others lived fully. I wonder about those lives, about the chances I never took to truly connect or understand. It’s painful to think how fleeting it all is, how quickly it’s gone.\n\nIn complete isolation, I share this here, hoping to find a little relief.

I came to this new place for work; there are three colleagues I hang around with, we eat together, talk, laugh sometimes. But no matter where I go or who I’m with, I keep finding myself missing you.\n\nI miss you when I sit in restaurants — your voice, your laughter. Every time I go to the cinema, I still keep the seat beside me empty. I can’t bring myself to let anyone sit there. That seat belongs to the memory of your hand in mine, your head on my shoulder, the way we used to whisper during the movie and forget the world around us.\n\nI’m trying so hard to act normal — to work, to talk, to smile — because I know that’s what you’d want me to do. You’d want me to stay calm, to keep going. But the truth is, I’m breaking a little every day. I’ve transferred all our photos to my phone — over 8,000 moments frozen in time. Every time I scroll through them, it feels like I’m traveling back — seeing our younger selves, how happy we were, how much we grew together. We really did grow up side by side — from two careless kids to two souls deeply tangled in love and life.\n\nThose pictures are all I have now. Each one is a doorway to a memory — the smiles, the trips, the silly fights, the quiet nights, and the love that felt endless. I see your face and I can almost feel your presence — but then reality hits again, and I’m back to this silence, this distance that’s killing me slowly.\n\nIt’s been more than ten days without hearing from you. Ten days of unanswered thoughts, restless nights, and a constant ache that refuses to fade. I keep wondering — how are you? Are you okay? Are you still eating properly? Are you still holding up like you used to? I just need to know you’re fine — even one word from you would calm this storm inside me.\n\nI don’t know how to explain it, but it feels like I’m living half a life right now. I go through my day pretending everything’s okay, but inside, I’m screaming for this pain to stop. I miss you — not in a passing way, but in the kind that lingers deep in your chest, heavy and unrelenting.\n\nI miss you in ways that words can’t carry. And no matter how hard I try, I know I won’t be able to settle for less — not when my heart already knows what it means to have you.\n\nJaan dene ki ghadi thi aur main zinda raha\nAaj uski rukhsati thi aur main zinda raha\nAb kahin par doob marne ki bhi gunjaish nahin \nUski aankhon mein nami thi aur main zinda raha\nJinki gardan jhhuk gayi thi wo to kab ke mar gay \nMeri gardan kat gayi thi aur main zinda raha\nSabko mere hausale ki daad deni chahiye \nItni zalim zindagi thi aur main zinda raha\nKis tarah nazrein milaaun ab main uske hijr se \nBaat marne ki huyi thi aur main zinda raha\nSaari duniya chhodkar wo aa gaya tha mere paas Saari duniya mar gayi thi aur main zinda raha\nShehar bas tabdiil hone ko tha qabristan mein\nEk murde ki kami thi aur main zinda raha", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1orxksb/part_9_the_empty_seat_beside_me/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1orxksb/part_9_the_empty_seat_beside_me/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Why is it so hard to find a guy friend who’s older, and just actually have them as a friend? I’m sure it’s because I have a shit relationship with my older brother and my father, I’m not looking for a sugar daddy or anything like that. It’s just for some reason older men make me calm. I feel so fucking weird for that too like, I feel immediately sexualized for it. I don’t know, I’m not expecting anyone to actually read this,  but I really would like older guy friends. I’m tired of playing games solo. I’m tired of being in the house because I can’t go anywhere. I’m just tired of being isolated.

There are certain people on Reddit and in the real world who continue to be sad over being lonely because they secretly enjoy that feeling of being alone. They do.\n\nI was one of those people. But I'm trying to get better, so to do that I've got a vent, a big one, so I can let out all my frustrations before my week starts, that way I don't have a bad week.\n\nI'm 19M. Stop me if you've heard this one before - decent guy, good looking, doing all the right things - well, mostly, I'll get to that - and actively trying to get a partner since I was 14. I've had some close calls, sure. But it never worked out. Post-first date the girl would reveal herself to be incompatible, I would miss a social cue and fumble because of it, people would get turned off by my personality (I'm autistic), I go back to my porn addiction which is the one thing that I guess I'm not doing my best at, I guess that's why I'm not allowed to be happy is because an evil industry killed my innocence and rewired my brain chemistry when I was in elementary school.\n\nBut I kept trying. This year I found someone perfect for me!...she will move out of the country in a year, and doesn't want to date before then. Okay, sure. Right person wrong time...nevermind, she started talking about wanting a relationship again now. She keeps telling me about her crushes excitedly, and I nod and smile, but in the back of my head I'm like *hey, didn't you reject me because of wanting to leave the country? Do you understand how it makes me feel when you talk about wanting to date now? And you have not once acknowledged my pursuits since you rejected me? Why did your mind change? Or did you find something about me repulsive or incompatible, and so you made up an excuse?* \n\nAnd you know the drill. Hinge ghostings, casually mentioned boyfriends, and let's just be friends. There's a new one of these every month.\n\nIt's gotten so exhausting. I mean, I want something (a relationship) and I think I'm ready for it.\n\nBut then people close to me tell me I'm not ready because of my addiction. Which I am fighting like hell to get rid of. It would be nice to have someone to comfort me in those moments, to give me the comfort that I fruitlessly seek from porn sites.\n\nWhat's the key here? What's the thing I'm missing? What is the common knowledge that I specifically lack? Why can my racist piece of shit roommate have a hot gf, and all I get is rejection and ignorance?\n\nWell, the true answer is that there is no answer. Sometimes there's no rhyme or reason for it. I know people who found their person on an app and people who got raped because of an app. I know people who met their first boyfriend at 25 and people who had five partners before high school. There's no *good* reason why I am alone. It just sucks. What's the end? Hopefully, a woman who is mature and patient. But when all of it is up to chance, and the opportunities I take and don't take, and being at the right place at the right time...man it is discouraging to even try.\n\nBut let's be real. There's nothing I can do about it right now. You can't expect someone to think about you a certain way, and you can't think about rejection like an insult. No one owes you anything and all we have is ourselves in the end. I will continue going to therapy, I will graduate college, and I will publish so much writing. \n\nI can hug myself, and I can masturbate. I can provide myself a few of the comforts that media would have me believe can only be given by a romantic partner. When you think about it romance is just a literary invention from the 1100s. It doesn't have to be the end goal. Maybe it's not even something \"nice to have.\" Have you seen some of these subreddits? The relationship stories are scary. We're all dodging thousands of bullets every day by setting our standards higher than those freaks. That's something to applaud.\n\nIf you read this far, I care about you and I know you'll find the person you deserve, but right now just do what you love and improve yourself, because it's all we can do while we wait for a special person.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1omxjn7/vent_like_among_us_haha_funny/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1omxjn7/vent_like_among_us_haha_funny/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I was in a bad relationship:\n\nHe makes me feel crazy and that everything wasn’t so bad\n\nI can’t bring myself to date anyone. The thought of being with someone else just feels impossible right now.\n\nI don’t know how to move past everything that happened. I’m completely stuck, like I’m trapped in this loop of memories and I can’t break free. Every single day I wake up with this pit of anxiety in my stomach. I feel disgusting thinking about it all, going over and over every detail until I make myself sick. Look, he’s not evil or anything - I think he’s just really messed up mentally. But that doesn’t make any of this easier.\n\nSo I finally found a new therapist. It’s been forever since I’ve done therapy, and right now we’re just talking about surface stuff - what happened this week, practical things. But there’s all this heavy shit I need to get into and I’m terrified to even say it out loud. How do you tell someone you were in an abusive relationship? Just saying those words makes me feel insane.\n\nI’m stuck in this one way of thinking and I can’t get out. I don’t trust anyone anymore, but I keep texting him, keep seeing him even though I know it’s destroying me. Part of me just can’t handle the idea of starting completely over.\n\nEverything feels foggy lately. I’m numb but anxious at the same time, like I’m floating around in my own head. I replay the same moments over and over, trying to figure out what really happened. I saw him again recently and now I just feel like an idiot. I had broken up with him months ago and was actually starting to feel okay. Now it’s like I’m being dragged back into this nightmare.\n\nWe were together for five years. There were good times, I guess, but there were also so many times I was genuinely scared of him. Times when I felt completely powerless and alone. Things would be fine and then something horrible would happen, and afterwards he’d act like nothing ever happened. I started questioning if I was remembering things right, if I was losing my mind.\n\nI’ve been avoiding saying this, but I think the relationship was abusive. And now I’m in this awful place where I feel torn apart inside. I don’t want to destroy his life - he has nothing. No money, nowhere stable to live, serious mental health problems. But what he did to me was horrible. I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.\n\nHis family either ignores what he does or makes excuses for him. When I try to talk about it, they make me feel like I’m crazy - not just him, but them too. It makes me doubt everything.\n\nHere’s what I know happened:\n\nOne time I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.\n\nHe pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.\n\nHe tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I said no, he kept shoving it at me until it spilled everywhere, then he slapped me and called me a stupid bitch. Said I was the problem.\n\nHe got drunk and stormed into my apartment screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my stuff around, ripped my shirt off me, and held me down. My roommate had to physically kick him out.\n\nThe first time he grabbed my throat, I was half-naked. I had to do a Zoom meeting after with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up later, he said it was sexual and that I was exaggerating.\n\nHe wouldn’t drive me to work unless we had sex first. If I cried or was running late, he’d threaten to just leave me there.\n\nDuring sex, when he got frustrated or couldn’t get hard, he’d pinch me hard, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a bitch.\n\nOnce he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.\n\nHe drove like a maniac, pulling my hair and saying we were both going to die because I talked about leaving him. I had a complete panic attack.\n\nHe choked me. Multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to scare the hell out of me.\n\nHe wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.\n\nHis cousin heard me crying during a fight and came in to check. He got even more pissed and blamed me for letting someone see me like that.\n\nWhen his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt so humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.\n\nHe used to “check” me to see if I’d been with other guys, while he was out there cheating on me.\n\nHe bit my face when he was angry and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.\n\nI think early in our relationship he did something sexual to me when I was half-asleep after getting high. It’s fuzzy but it still haunts me.\n\nIf I said something hurt or that I wanted to stop during sex, he’d laugh at me, say I was lying, or just keep going.\n\nHe called me a cheater for wanting to hang out with friends or family. Meanwhile he was the one lying and cheating.\n\nI hate admitting this, but sometimes I just gave in to sex because I was scared of what would happen if I said no. I’d cry during it or after and feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or made me stay in positions until he was done with whatever he was doing.\n\nOne time the neighbors heard me crying and him screaming. He was throwing things, yelling threats through the wall, saying he’d kill them. Later he blamed me for the whole thing.\n\nSo why do I still feel so confused about everything?\n\nHe’s been through trauma. He has mental health issues. Part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that makes what he did okay.\n\nIs this actually abuse? Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he wouldn’t let me stop?\n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind trying to understand it all. And I still feel guilty. I can’t make myself report anything - he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left him. But I’m still carrying around all this pain and I don’t know what to do with it.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1ojj86j/feel_like_i_only_want_to_be_alone/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1ojj86j/feel_like_i_only_want_to_be_alone/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

If love, attraction, or anything beyond that manifests itself, I’m just gonna roll with my feelings — and I absolutely know to trust them.\n\nLife is something you move downstream through, keeping it on the best possible path toward your ultimate, perfect goal. You do that by embracing either a single lifestyle or a committed, honest relationship — whichever one aligns with your truth.\n\nBecause yearning for something you don’t currently have only creates emptiness, incompletion, failure, and hopelessness — emotions that have no business existing in your life. You can abolish that entire search for “the other person” and instead embrace your single, happy, non-committed freedom with confidence, knowing that things are going exactly as they should.\n\nWhy? Because you are the one making every decision in front of you — building yourself into the best possible version of who you can be. Every choice you make adds to your self-respect, your confidence, your motivation, your strength, and your invincibility to achieve any goal.\n\nYou can live your life thinking, “I’m lonely, I’m a loser, and nobody loves me.” Or — you can do what I just described above. You can embrace that lifestyle and realize you have options. You can do whatever the hell you want without worrying about disappointing someone else.\n\nBecause here’s the truth: playing it safe is playing an unhappy role. Sticking with someone you don’t love just because you’re afraid of being alone is a one-way ticket to misery. That’s a life of lonely comfort with a stranger who drains your energy. That’s insanity.\n\nThe fear of being alone causes so many people to spend their lives with someone they don’t like, love, or even want to be around — just to avoid silence. Take the loss. Kick them to the curb. Get over it. Move forward. Focus on yourself. And watch the results unfold — a happy life.\n\nThis is the Scott Method, and it works.\nIf you trust me, you’ll live the way you’re supposed to live, and it’ll end the way it’s supposed to end — because the path is already in front of you. You don’t need to overthink it. The map is laid out clearly. Just follow it.\n\nWhen love, happiness, companionship, joy, and true connection appear before you, you won’t miss them. You’ll see them. You’ll feel them. You’ll know them. And you’ll take them — because they’ll slap you right in the face with the clarity of what’s real.\n\nWhen that happens, don’t push it away. Take it in. Live your life with that person who makes you a better version of yourself, and move forward with total confidence that you’re living the life you were meant to live. She’s on your path — and you’ll find her when you’re walking it.\n\nDo you hear what I’m saying?\nIs this easy to understand, or do I need to continue from different angles?\n\nEmbrace your current status as the best possible version of your alternate life. If you do this, love will find you — because it’s supposed to. It’s already on the road laid out before you.\n\nOr, you can stay miserable — avoiding the fear of loneliness while living with someone who makes you feel lonely anyway. Two miserable souls sustaining each other’s unhappiness till the end.\n\nYour guide to decision-making that leads to your true path of happiness concludes with this: 👉\n\nTake the pain. Make the changes. Love the life you’re going to live — because you’re going to live a life you’ll love.\n\nFill that bucket of self-respect with as many XP points as possible.\nFill that bucket of self-love and confidence with as many XP points as possible.\nFill those buckets with the right decisions — they’re printed right in front of you, bold and bright.\n\nYou couldn’t miss them if you tried.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1o2t6k1/your_life_a_simple_guide_to_your_ultimate_life/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1o2t6k1/your_life_a_simple_guide_to_your_ultimate_life/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I’m starting to feel like I’m meant to be single forever.", "selftext": "I’m 20, a sophomore in college. I’ve never had a girlfriend in my entire life, and lately it’s been eating at me. All I’ve ever wanted is to love someone fiercely and have her love me back with the same energy. I want to be the kind of boyfriend who makes her feel safe, listened to, and cherished — the one who hugs her while we’re watching movies, whispers kind words, and makes her feel like she’s the most special girl in the world. That’s honestly been my dream for as long as I can remember.\n\nI’ve tried to put myself out there. So far, I’ve had about four serious attempts at asking out girls I genuinely liked. Each one ended in rejection. It’s starting to feel like a scoreboard — 0‑4 — and I’m terrified that if the girl I like now isn’t interested, that’ll be 0‑5. I know that dating isn’t a game, but in my heart, every “no” is another nail in the coffin of me ever being in a relationship.\n\nThe thing is, I’m not some stereotypical “bad guy” type; in fact, it's literally the complete opposite. I’m a college athlete on the swim team, involved in my school’s media club (Which is where I first met the girl I like right now, as of writing this), I have friends, hobbies, ambition, and I try to treat people with kindness. I don’t play games. I’m upbeat by nature. When I like someone, I support her, cheer her on, and try to build a real connection. But every time it ends with “I see you as a friend,” or just no spark on their side.\n\nI’m still young, but after 20 years of never having a girlfriend, it’s hard not to feel like something’s fundamentally wrong with me. No matter how much I work on myself, no one will ever want me back. I don’t want to pretend to be someone I’m not just to keep a girl’s interest. I want someone who actually likes me for me — my kind, positive, loyal self.\n\nRight now, I’m interested in someone new — a girl on the soccer team who transferred to my school. As I mentioned, we’re in the same digital media club at college. We talk a bit on Snapchat; she seems like such a sweet, amazing person. But at the same time, I’m already scared. I don’t want to overthink, push too hard, or scare her off. I don’t want to get my hopes up just to be rejected again. I want, for once, to have a relationship where my heart is safe and my love is returned.\n\nI guess I’m just venting here. It feels like I’ve always wanted to give someone my heart, but it never works. I don’t know what to do anymore. I'll come back here and update you on how it all goes with this girl, but I don't want to give my hopes up. I don't want to die alone.\n\nTL;DR: I’m a 20‑year‑old college student who’s never had a girlfriend despite multiple attempts. All I’ve ever wanted is to love someone deeply and have her love me back. I’m kind, positive, and genuinely supportive, but every girl I’ve liked so far has only seen me as a friend. I’m interested in a new girl now but terrified of another rejection. I just want to know if there’s hope for someone like me or if I’m destined to stay single.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nyu94p/20_m_im_starting_to_feel_like_im_meant_to_be/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nyu94p/20_m_im_starting_to_feel_like_im_meant_to_be/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

There are times that I want a relationship, but I refuse to settle for anything less than I deserve because I’ve done that enough already. Majority of my friends never reach out first. Since I stopped, I never get a text or a call first, or at all.\n\nI got out of a relationship a little over two months ago and I miss him everyday like crazy. But I gave everything I had. Even if he came back with promises, I couldn’t trust it. I knew I had to start choosing myself and I feel like I do that everyday that he stays blocked, but it’s extremely hard. I feel like that was the one true connection that I would have a chance at finding.\n\nMy best friend was an ex I dated years ago and we have always depended on each other emotionally. I reached a point where I questioned if the friendship was still healthy for the both of us. He started working nights and I could tell my neediness was a lot and I didn’t want to first, overwhelm him, and second, I didn’t want to depend on him. But he was the only person left in my life that I felt somewhat cared. We made the decision to go no contact and I blocked him to hold better discipline for myself. After we blocked each other, I called an old friend that was stationed with us years ago and he mentioned the possibility of my ex still having feelings and that being the reason why he’s around.\nThat destroyed me.\nWhat I thought was my most genuine friendship was just a hope for me to give him another chance again? I don’t know. I don’t want to be the oblivious person and say “there’s no way” but I’m not sure. And maybe it’s not even worth trying to ask or find out. I feel like the best thing to do is move on but it’s been so difficult. I feel like I lost the two main people in my life in just a few months and idk what the hell has happened.

I'm trying to get better offers off-campus, but I really don't think there's any chance for a fresher like me to get a reply from any company.\n\nTalking about my personal life: I don’t come from a very rich family. My father is the only breadwinner of the family. I have an elder sister who is currently unemployed and preparing for government exams, and a loving mother who has never pressured us about anything, unlike most Indian moms.\n\nAbout my friends: I have one friend since 6th standard (for like 10 years); we talk regularly, but we are in different cities. Talking about my college friends, I barely have any. During my first year, it started well; I got to make a lot of friends, but slowly they all drifted away, especially in the third year. I got into a relationship with a girl who cheated on me in my second year; it still hurts seeing her face in college. I had a good friend but got backstabbed; it hurts to see his face too in college. I had one friend, but he rarely attends college and rarely picks up anyone’s calls—I think he is struggling too.\n\nI had feelings for a girl in the third year, but she didn’t love me back. We were good friends though, but we rarely talk now. She got placed in a good company with a decent package, so now I feel kinda embarrassed to talk to her because in the upcoming time she will earn more than me.\n\nNow, I’m in the 4th year and started talking to a batchmate; we are decent friends. I never told him that I feel alone sometimes, but I guessed it is written all over my face that I’m unhappy with my current situation. He told me I should talk to my old friends, but I’m just tired of always being the guy who makes the first move—I don’t want to anymore. I don’t know what to do now.\n\nI’m never interested in anything like watching movies, YouTube, or anything else. I just 24/7 constantly feel the need to talk to someone.

I have been seriously lonely for a while now. I actually used to have a lot of friends. We either grew apart or they had kids. So now I just hang out with my cats and watch movies.\n\nI do have hobbies though. I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, interior decorating and I rescently started a new art craft. I buy vintage picture frames and cut my own custome matting around art with a new matt cutting tool I got. I thought maybe some people would enjoy my work and buy it, but I'm mostly doing it to learn the craft.\n\nRegardless of that, at work I'm kind and I really want to do a good job at work. Soooo badly, but I struggle with my memory due to anxiety and depression. Probably due to lonelyness too. I plan to start writing down notes to help me memorize tasks. People treat me like I'm stupid for having memory issues. Witch creates more stress and anxiety and makes my memory even worse. \n\nI started taking zoloft for the first time again in 8 years. That helped a lot, but I was having an intense side effect of being very sweaty from taking it. So my Dr. prescribed me lexapro. I'll tell you what... this stuff is making my anxiety and depression soooooooo much worse than I ever experince before taking any SSRI. \n\nI have dark thoughts. Mostly blaming myself for being \"stupid\" and not being able to preform work as well as I can. I want to hurt myself. I want to disapear. Like the world would be better without me in it. \n\nIronically, I work for a funeral home. The funeral directors sometimes treat me like I'm stupid. I guess I don't blame them. I forget what they tell me because I'm so stressed and anxious to mess up. I want to do well. I want to do well so bad. \n\nI also would love to make friends at work. Maybe I have this energy of desperation. I can tell maybe I make people uncomfortable. I try not too. I think I over share just so people don't treat me badly for forgetting things. I think it has made the friend making even worse. \n\nPeople won't look at me. They are curt with me. They are passive aggressive to me. Now people don't even respond when I talk to them. \nI just have to accept that coworkers are just that. Not friends. \n\nThis paired with my new medication making my mental health worse than ever has made me spiral. I cry about the rejection. The pain of this rejection feels like when I had to put my cat down. It's so painful. It's so lonely. \n\nI plan to taper off the medication and tell my Dr in the next few days at my appointment. Hopefully things get better.

Today is my birthday and it feels strange. Only one person congratulated me, and none of my family has. On top of that, I’ve been sick with the flu for 4 days, so I don’t even have the energy to do anything.  \nI’ve lived a lonely life all these years, and it’s something I’ve gotten used to. About 3 years ago, I met a girl on Discord in a community a friend created. We were friends for about a year, and then we became long-distance partners. It was a beautiful relationship that lasted a year. But the relationship ended on her side, while I still loved her and wanted to continue, since the problem wasn’t between us but something external. The breakup happened during the first week of November (right when our anniversary was coming up). It hit me really hard because with her I didn’t need anyone else to socialize with. I had friends, with whom I’m still in touch, but I haven’t had anyone else to socialize with at the level I did with her. (In my family, I was raised in a way where we don’t usually talk about our feelings.) With her, I could tell her about my day, what I did, what I wanted to do. She told me about her life, about her dreams, which also became mine, because before I met her I was totally lost, without dreams or goals, and she made me dream.\n\nIt’s been about 10 months since the breakup, and honestly the only thing I’ve missed is having that kind of connection again. I don’t miss her; I miss what I could do with her and the fact that I could open up emotionally to someone else. Also, because of how my family treated me during childhood, it’s really hard for me to open up emotionally to other people and be sociable.\n\nSorry if this isn’t well structured, but it’s just what I’m thinking in the moment.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nnsn21/i_feel_lonely/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nnsn21/i_feel_lonely/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I thought, WTF, she’s gorgeous. Wow.\n\nI sat in the car, ate a snack, drank a coffee, and looked around. I wanted a little bit of hustle around me, people, cars, life. I wanted to see life, because I don’t have one.\n\nThen I realized: shit, it’s her after all. I saw in the rearview mirrors that she was sitting there with her friend. They were talking about some girly stuff, some total nonsense. They were giggling, and that made me happy.\n\nThey were talking about something totally banal, then they laughed and were excited. Then I looked ahead and, across the street, there were two more. Maybe a year or two older. They were doing the same exact thing.\n\nI kept looking around, seeing life left, right, up, down, glanced briefly at the rearview mirror, then forward, to the right, watching everything. Who’s driving by, what are they doing, what kind of car is that, that’s a cool motorcycle.\n\nThen I looked forward again, the two girls were giggling again, and one of them waved and said hello in an exaggerated high voice. Maybe she waved a bit sarcastically in my direction, I don’t know. I wasn’t sure, I had only looked for a very short moment. Did they mean me or was she telling her friend something? Or was she teasing me a bit?\n\nOf course she had her phone in her hand, because otherwise they don’t have anything in their hands, except maybe a Red Bull. No idea, maybe they also took a photo of me, nice and zoomed, it was only like fifty meters maybe, and I was really happy earlier when I felt their joy for life, and that was so nice, because I don’t have it, because I’m always alone and I’ll never experience that, definitely not anymore at my age.\n\nI never experienced it, because at that age nothing was happening for me, as always. Then I thought, that would be so nice, and then I immediately thought: they can be so nice, but they can also be total monsters. If they don’t like you and you just glance in their direction for a second, they might take a photo of you and post it somewhere and label you a creep and a pig or whatever, just because they don’t like your nose.\n\nIf you’re a handsome guy, you could stare into their eyes for half an hour, no problem. Then I realized how quickly they can destroy someone’s life.\n\nThey can be sugar-sweet and in the next moment a total monster, without thinking a second about what they’re doing, like a small child, without thinking a second about the consequences of their actions. And then I thought: you know what, you can’t do anything to me, you can do absolutely nothing. Post it, even if I only looked in your direction for a total of thirty seconds in the last ten minutes and then smiled because it made me happy to see that joy for life, then go ahead.\n\nSomeday you might hear from friends, from male friends or maybe from your brother or your cousin, that someone did that to them and they maybe still had something to lose, and then you’ll realize what you did or almost did. But you can’t hurt me anymore. You can publish everything about me. You can publish any lies, just write whatever about what that guy did or who he is. You can do nothing to me, I’m already at rock bottom and have been here a long time and I know there’s absolutely no hope left.\n\nI’m mentally stronger than all of you combined. 95% of you would have killed yourselves by thirty at the latest if you had lived my life. I’ve been here forty years, do what you can’t stop doing.\n\nMaybe you can laugh about it for a minute or two or five. Maybe you’ll regret it someday too, but you can’t take anything from me anymore. I have nothing left to lose. \n\nI’m alone. \n\nI’m invincible.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nm5dvf/the_last_warm_day/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1nm5dvf/the_last_warm_day/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I like ‘femcels’, even if this term is derogatory, because they have the merit of questioning themselves, unlike incels, who are an aberration.\n\nThis is a translation from my native language, because I prefer to write in it to let off steam.\n\nI have no friends.  \nI have no one I love.\n\nNo one is waiting for me outside, except for a few people in my family. But family is family. That is to say, my parents love me because they are my parents and I am their flesh and blood. That's all. I could be a jellyfish, it would be more practical, because they don't like the way I think or act. I'm not like them.\n\nI don't know if I'm intelligent, but I think I am. However, there is no evidence to prove it. This introduction is to express that I have no friends and that the only friends I have ever wanted would have been people with whom I could debate. But without the culture of immediacy, rather with a logical approach, or at least an expression of thought where everyone listens to each other. Or a message to express the mechanical depth, all the secrets, all the gems of the cavity that a thought represents. Elegies, tomes of reasoning. Or endless calls.\n\nI know it sounds a bit too elitist.\n\nAnd I'm aware of that. That's why I'm explaining that it's my fault. I chose this path because that's how it is. I've been in love twice before. And although I've experienced humour, I need intellect. Of course, there has to be a middle ground. And I'm not talking about discussions to the point of pretending to be an adult.\n\nFor me, being an adult means being a child. And keeping your childlike spirit. To quote someone on the internet: Be a child when you can and be an adult when you have to.\n\nSo I wish to have a friend with whom I can swing on a swing. Someone I can read with while still being myself. Not this forced version of myself that I show to others, whom I consider strangers, even if I've known them for decades, and who is different. Not this version of myself that I smooth over, not this version of myself that I make laugh on purpose or pretend to like certain things. Me.\n\n  \nThank you for reading this. I wish you the best.

After her passing there was a complete rift between us and her side of the family.   Basically I lost all my cousins, aunts and uncles.   Only my father was left.  His side of the family only exists abroad.  He had one remaining older sister left and she passed sometime around 2004.   So in essence, after her passing, that side of the family was split off as well.   Three years ago my old man passed in the hospital.  I had one last conversation with him by phone that final morning.  He was very groggy and weak and talked about how the meal I fed him from the day before was upsetting his stomach.   Very mundane stuff.   He had been in and out of the hospital for several months for congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, etc.   His feet had turned black with gangrene.  Now he was readmitted after just coming home for one night.   His blood pressure had dropped dangerously low and they used dopamine to artificially raise his blood pressure.  But there was little else they can do.   Once they weaned him off the dopamine his blood pressure dropped again.  He had not eaten in days.  He had little to no bowel movement.   He kept seeing things and people that were not there.   He was preparing to die.   \nWithin ten minutes after hanging up the phone, a nurse called me back and told me he was gone.   I cursed at them and demanded to know why but little did I know at the time he signed off on a do-not-resuscitate form.   My old man was the last thing on earth to verify my existence.  I spent over 25 years caring for him and he was gone.   At the wake I could barely gather more than two handfuls of visitors.   At his burial I stood there nearly alone were it not for my wife.    I kept his apartment “alive” for the next several years, trying to fend off repossession by his landlords.  I reproduced our traditions and customs the best I could but as faithful as they were, it was hollow and empty.  Who is going to enjoy them?  Who is going to share in them?  Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Years, etc died along with him.   When people are outside celebrating and laughing I feel bad inside.  I see families enjoying a Mother’s Day or Father’s Day and it is just so painful.  I avoid topics of family with coworkers and acquaintances.   They often ask me what I did and where I went for the holidays, did I have family over and I often make up things to pretend.   His home I kept as a shrine of sorts but there was nothing left.   In the end, I gave that up too.  The whole experience has given me a more closed nihilistic view of life.   What I do what anyone does means absolutely nothing.   In the end, it doesn’t matter.   I often ask myself why I bother to stick around.   There really is no meaning.   In the end, when I go, no one will notice.  And I guess I have to live with that.  I bought a plot next to my old man but I’m not sure who is going to bury me there.   For all I know, I will probably get tossed into some hole somewhere.   \n", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1na2yv3/zero_family/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1na2yv3/zero_family/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

You either focus on  your career or you’re getting an additional degree. \n\nI’ve pretty much made many mistakes right after my college and i wish someone could advice me on what to do. \n\nI gratuated college right after 2020, the year of covid with an offer letter from an another college for my MBA. Unfortunately i cancelled it cause I ddnt wish to do it online. \n\nI was pretty much still of a hothead during my early 20’s . I took up a random job worked there for like 8 months and I left it to join up w an old school friend for an entrance coaching.\n\nI practiced for like 8 months during the coaching but I could not clear it since CAT’s pretty tough. I finish the exam on November 2021.\n\nThen I plan to rush for my masters intake for the UK for the September 2022 intake. Took up a random tech support job since I ddnt wish to sit idle during that time frame. \n\nThat backfired me cause my sister got engaged during November 2022 and the wedding was fixed on July 2023. I had to stay on my so called chumma taken time pass tech support job  till July 2023 because I needed the money coming to help my dad \n\nAfter that is when I had a long lonely thought process on what to actually do w my life. I’m a bachelors in business graduate in finance and hence I decided to take up a role in wealth management  and financial securities because I found a strong purpose in helping my Friends and family manage money.\n\nI did a short term course in Delhi, studied my ass of for 5 month and joined a company as a financial writer. \n\nI worked there for a while and moved back to Saudi Arabia. Honestly I never liked India. As an Indian I was born and brought up here. \n\nCurrently I’m unemployed. It’s been 5 years since college. I feel really lonely at times. Some of my friends took a decent job and stuck to it for 5 years and became managers of those role.\n\n\nI feel like I lost a lot of time rushing into doing a masters. Most of my plans failed and it backfired me. I need a strong sense of direction in my career and purpose in my life.\n\nPost college thoughts can hit pretty deep. It’s the loneliness, the lost feeling, your friends making their own choices and prospering in life, a lot of your childhood and teen memories reflecting in your 20’s.\n\n\nMy dream is to do a masters from the UK but I’ve no money. I clearly don’t know what to w this life of mine for now. I’m someone who sucks at making choices and planning things. And whatever I plan tends to backfire me .I need advice on how to fix my mistakes and make better decisions here moving forward . I feel lonely, lost, miserable for my past choices . \n\nThe only happy choice I made was getting into the financial writer job and a lot of happiness for me plays a major part of if I’m In a country with the absolute best standards of living or not.\n\nI’m never happy in India.

Мне на днях исполнилось 20 и я поняла, что мои родители уже из последних сил пытаются меня сломать. Я очень нестандартной внешности (тату, пирсинг, стрижка, стиль одежды), но это не так критично, как кажется. Однако моим родителям это приносить огромный дискомфорт. \nНачну, пожалуй, с моего дня рождения. Мой отец заехал за мной и повёз в пиццерию. Казалось бы, мне уже 20, сейчас поговорим об увлечениях, планах на жизнь и прочее, но нет. Он опять начал учить меня жизнь, финансам, пытаться указывать мне, что делать и прочее. Я сидела и молчала, так как мне было очень неприятно это выслушивать. Под конец я поняла, что за этот год мне надо набраться смелости и послать своего отца, высказав ему своё недовольство. \nТеперь, моя мать..бл@ть! Я взяла кредит, чтобы закрыть другой и снять жильё, дабы не жить в зале, где толком я не могу переодеться из-за отчима, который в любой момент может выйти из своей спальни. Да, своей комнаты у меня нет, в отличии от матери и отчима. Мало этого, отчим бухает и не редко выходить полностью голый при мне. Вот я сняла жильё и от своего доброго сердца дала 10 тыс рублей маме на кредит. Где-то дня 3 я не перевозили вещи, сомневалась, а потом в один день перевезла почти всё и начался цирк. Моя мать начала внушать мне мысли сомнения \"А ты уверена, что делаешь всё правильно? Зачем тебе переезжать? У тебя сейчас неполадки с работой\" и прочее. Мой арендодатель меня поддержал, так что я перестала слепо верить матери, а наблюдать и увидела то, чего добивается мои мать и отец. \nОни хотят, чтобы я стала их марионеткой, заложницей, без финансов, под постоянным контролем. \nМой отец очень хочет, чтобы я извинилась перед бабушкой по маминой линии, которая выкачивала из меня деньги, а как они закончились, начала издеваться надо мной, просто чтобы я была под её контролем. Ещё и деньги ей давала с чего то вдруг. \nМать внушает мне диагнозы, то дипрессию, то апатию, то шизу, лишь бы я сомневалась в собственной вминяемости и перестала идти вперёд. Она не хочет, чтобы я сьезжала, так как она тоже качает из меня деньги, а на отказ грозится выгнать из квартиры. Сейчас я съехала и её угрозы не имеют силы, поэтому она бесится. \nПоягла только сейчас, обидно, но мне срочно надо с этим прощаться. Да, с работой произошёл кошмар. Я стажировалась не в очень хорошем баре, под конец я настолько вымоталась, что начала косячить с заявками и когда уже квартира была снята, уволилась. Это не моя вина, ведь в мои обязанности, как бармена не должна были входить мытье всей посуды и уборка стафа после закрытия, но они были. Убила кожу на руках сильно, выматывалась в запары. Сейчас добиваюсь назначения стажировки на новом место, надеюсь не сольют молчанием. Вроде явных признаков нету. \nВ общем, мои родители потребители и монстры, которые пытаются сожрать мою личность, но я защищаю её, как могу. \nКогда всё наладится, постараюсь написать, что сделала, а что нет", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1n2tgo3/мои_родители_пытаются_сделать_из_меня_удобную/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1n2tgo3/мои_родители_пытаются_сделать_из_меня_удобную/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

The plant nursery had a older clientele and so I interacted with a lot of older people who were interested in gardening and I really enjoyed it. I loved learning about the plants there and always being around people who could share plant knowledge. I honestly felt like I was going through my own form of \"plant therapy\" and would read the back labels of the pesticides and fertilizers and have fun learning about the chemical compounds they contained. Fast forward to me quitting i thought i loved older people and potentially work with them. I thought I would enjoy being a caretaker. I ended up finding a job as a caretaker which would provide me with the ability to learn about the medical devices as well and the medical equipment since I would also be giving medication after a while. A lot of the employees there were going to nursing school or had been nurses and ended up in this position. I was an anomaly since I had no experience in the medical field but proved a willingness to learn and was thrown in. I quickly learned that I was pretty good at it and suggested to attain a CNA license and learn on the job.  It was at a old folks residence where you cared for them and could also be a part of their group activities. I had volunteered at nursing homes in the past and once again thought that it would be something id enjoy. I lasted like a month. I quickly started being put into the more extreme alzheimers residence once they figured out that I learned pretty quickly and was pretty good at deesculating situations and talking to patients with alzheimers. I was good at going into their narratives and convincing them to do things or get them out of anger or crying spells. But I had been told that I was \"too nice\" or needed to be less smiley with them. At first I didn't know what that meant but I did realize that my female coworkers quickly started finding me...annoying? I didn't really understand until I did. Fast forward and I had 3 residents admit to me things they did to children when they were younger and in churches especially. I quickly became so damn paranoid. I started bringing a Bible to the job and would read scriptures to the residents that admitted heinous things, trying to convince myself they deserved forgiveness. But oh my goodness. Looking those pedophiles in the eyes, I started to hate everything.  I have a youthful face and always despised it. I worked food service at a young age and would get creepy regulars and especially old white men since im in the south. I slowly started to realize that all of the creeps in my life looked just like them. One guy especially would fall out of his bed on purpose in order to get me to help him back onto the bed. His smile showing as he would beckon me and say \"oh hello sweetheart\". Some of them reverting and probably associating me with their past lovers or children they creeped on. It was absolutely disgusting. I became so paranoid and during the night shifts I would become more and more afraid. I quit quickly and realized...I despise people. I despise pedophiles especially sure but i just wanted to go into a hole and never come out. It helped me see that all the times I spent as a young girl wondering if I wore the wrong item of clothing or smiled the wrong way and was suggestive or laughed too much out of fear at something someone said...it really wasn't my fault. These types of creeps really were that sick. They really had no remorse and they were seriously broken. At first even though I was paranoid I would try and find out what happened to them and although my coworkers told me that they dont speak in a way you can understand...they would start confessing things that occurred to them and such. I would feel guilt for them but also I couldn't feel enough of it since it was all just sick. I domt work there anymore and im taking 3 classes this year and am going to finish my degree in environmental engineering. I thought I couldn't handle it since I honestly have issues with men and I hated the in person requirements of science major things due to chemistry labs and such but I finally get it now. I didn't like the old people at the nursery. I liked the nature. I liked the fact that I got to learn about plants and the science behind them if I wanted since the customers were happy to talk about them. It made me remember making capsule medication out of plants while in high school. Because I always had issues with people and suggestive things since I was young since honestly? I feel like there wasn't a rule book on any of this sexual crap in life besides what you hear from your peers and it can be so damaging trying to fit into sexually active people who talk about kinks and such which you try to understand but you dont get how they are actually participating in it since...aren't we kids? I was so scared the first time a guy tried to do stuff to me without me knowing that there were any signals of such things. They ended up stopping after seeing me afraid and repeatedly telling them to stop but...like...I was 19. I was supposed to know, right? But I was a childish immature brat I guess. Because i didnt know. I dont ever know. I have no idea how i am going to date in life even if I love kids since i understand that I just like caring for people. But not for anyone and I definitely cant mentally handle the medical field. I have a father who has a plethora of medical conditions I've had to see him deal with so honestly? I'll probably end up under hospital care earlier in life and i dont need to rush into it. I dont and i dont want to. I don't like humans anymore. I love them but I am so tired of human beings. Im tired of creeps. Im tired of it all. I hate being told I look young for my age but at least I won't stand out going back to school at 23 and being older I guess. Because I really, really get it. I can't work at a restaurant restaurant right now either since I literally don't want to have to be sweet to people as part of my job. Especially not if I find someone creepy. I am so tired of laughing things off. Im so tired of it all. Im 23. Im supposed to be mature and into people but honestly? I cant and I cant imagine it. I have friends who help me feel comfortable since i know thwy arent judgemental or anything about my anxiety but I go out and I hate older people so much. And im older now so im one of them. But im one of the bitter ones. One of the ones who hides disgust behind a smile. I honestly think I'll end up alone since...I have weird stranger danger? I mean I'll probably just end up with someone i work or go to school with and interact with because \"mature\" flirting? Hah. Shoot me because I have no idea how to do it and I have no intention of learning. Im just glad I know now about how much I hate people secretly. Thought I wanted to do social work in the past but I dont. I just want to do overseas volunteer  work. And guess what. You can do that with an environmental engineering degree. I dont have to directly work \"with\" people. I dont even think I'll have to necessarily smile besides networking and I can do that. Thank God I found out how much I needed to be left alone. I am so, so tired of becoming terrified of creeps. I never went to anyone when I was younger about any of my fears and let them pile on top of each other and I know that this is just being a female or kid in this world but God it was so disgusting. It was so disgusting having to learn the moment you're alone as a kid and you e ter the world? There will be those waiting to teach you who to avoid as they ask your age and say \"oh how young \" with their creepy smiles. And I wasn't crazy for thinking some of their damn invitations or craving to help me was weird. Because they were monsters. They were pigs. I dont like old people. I liked my grandparents and I liked the older people who loved plants. I hate that my childhood makes me think Japan was safer since id go there no issue since honestly they just thought due to my height that I was older which was nice to be treated with respect at 16 because of if but so this country im in? I hated how many damn creeps there were. I hated it so much. And i shouldn't have been afraid of them. I just should have started carrying a knife on me earlier.

I (M19) am beginning my second year of college tomorrow. I’ve been a very isolated person my whole life. I never had siblings, I didn’t have a single friend until 6th grade (that friendship just ended), I never had close relationships with any family member, and my job is seasonal, so I don’t see the co workers there beyond a few months a year. Last year (my first year of college) I was in a horrible social situation that was harmful and dangerous for me. I now am going into my second year of university entirely alone. My question is, how do I “put myself out there”? Or make friends? I’ve asked this question a lot, so here are some things I’ve already tried/things to consider.\n\n1. I’ve tried joining clubs, but not only does my school have very few clubs, but all I joined are disbanded. I look at the club list everyday, and I haven’t seen anything I can really join. I can’t make my own until I have 15 people to sign up, and I’m not there yet.\n2. My school doesn’t have much of a party scene. We’re next to a huge university, so everyone just goes there.

Before I dive in I shall say that there is a major difference between being along and feeling lonely. I feel as if many who posted in this sub has confused the two. \n\nBack to my story - I’m not sure of the logic behind finding peace from within. It may be due to past trauma and/or bad experiences with roommates - and if so - I’m grateful for it now. \n\nI have the freedom to do what I want. I’m not dependent on anyone. I have no dependents. I recently started to go in solo trips and had a blast. It’s got to the point where social settings have become sparse now. My social battery runs out quicker. All I want is to go home and be at peace in my cave. I invested in my own hobbies that I enjoy more than anything.\n\nI had prior relationships and have learned with each one that I value my alone time more than anything else. I have no intent to look for a partner. The dating scene is horrible. Not that I’m cutting that aspect of my life out, if someone worth a damn comes a long, I will definitely consider it. But for now - let me do me.\n\nI find it odd how society shames people who prefer this lifestyle. Why should I be guilted into social situations when I am at my best alone? I have noticed that my solitude directly results to my health. I’m in the best shape of my life. I seldomly drink alcohol. I’m not peer pressured to consume bad things all the time with people. I keep a consistent gym schedule that I’m sure would be rough to follow if I had an active social life. \n\nI have also noticed that my self-imposed glow up has triggered other people’s insecurities and they project onto me. It’s not my fault I am not affected by peer pressure. Things like this also detract me from being social. I’m not gonna subject myself to people indirectly bashing me out of their own insecurities. Maybe these people should start working on themselves as well instead of depending on others for their happiness.\n\nThat’s just how I feel about it.

Ever since I was a kid, I never really fit in, no matter the environment. So I became acclimated at a young age to spending most of my time alone. But at least through school (all the way up to grad school) I was able to interact regularly with other people and acquire a few friends along the way, people I still keep in contact with. \n\nBut ever since my best friend moved out of town a couple years ago, I've experienced everything you mentioned in your post.\n\nBefore moving into my current apartment, which happened to coincide with my best friend's departure, I made it a point to live in group houses, mostly to save on rent but also to establish a baseline of social interaction. A few negative experiences notwithstanding, I had some really wonderful times. Parties, late-night smoking sessions, random hookups -- things you can only do with other people. And since I couldn't really afford to go out clubbing, having social housemates was the next best thing. But after my landlord sold the group house a couple years ago, the only place I could find that would accommodate me and my cat (non-negotiable, for various reasons) was a 1br basement apartment, a living arrangement I swore I'd never subject myself to again for reasons you already stated. \n\nAnd sure enough, after a couple financial setbacks forced me to cut back on going out even more, I found myself spending inordinate amounts of time essentially trapped inside. (Which was depressing enough on its own since, unlike the group house I'd moved from, this new apt barely had any windows, so there was very little natural light.) It would be one thing if I used that time to be productive -- I used to be a voracious reader, since being a published author has long been my career goal -- but instead I substituted my housemates with Youtube personalities whose content I could mindlessly binge. I became addicted to streaming and scrolling to fill the social void, to such an extent that, even if there was an exciting free event in town that in years past I would've gone to, I would nowadays choose to stay home out of fear of having an awkward conversation or spending money frivolously. \n\nAs a result, I've become more neurotic in some ways, more closed off for sure. While I still have friends I text somewhat regularly, I can go days without actually speaking to someone (aside from my now two cats, who are affectionate enough but insensate to my psychological woes). The self-critical voice in my head has grown louder while my actual voice has become frail. My facial expressions have become stonier, less animated, which has caused some people to label me as intimidating. (If only they knew!) Because I'm fairly handsome/well put together, however, people will occasionally express interest in getting to know me better, only to realize that, while affable enough in small bursts, I really struggle to communicate verbally. I think it's some combination of latent autism, untreated social anxiety, lack of self-confidence/self-esteem, and a general diminishment of my social skills after two years of living alone. (Think: unease with looking people in the eye, shaky voice, forced smiles/emotional reactions, inability to sustain a conversation beyond the first few exchanges, etc.) \n\nI've made efforts over the past two years to join different clubs and stuff like that, but none of them ever worked out: signed up for a flag football league and tore my ACL; joined a church but then quickly realized how cliquey its members were, and I'm past the point of begging to be accepted; tried to become chummy with coworkers, only to be embroiled in silly office drama. Heck, earlier this year I \\*almost\\* landed a side gig as a bicycle tour guide -- easy enough since I love history and have been biking around my city for a decade -- but even after training me they wouldn't hire me because of my poor social skills. \n\nAll this to say: my social skills were never great, but through school and shared housing arrangements I was a able to maintain something akin to a social life. Unfortunately, after two years of living on my own -- two years beset my financial strife and heated estrangement from my family -- my social skills have deteriorated to the point that I feel a mounting and distinct sense of alienation from most other people around me. I have a couple buddies around town I chop it up with when I see them, but outside of that I hardly talk to anyone. \n\nAnd yes, that means women, too. (Though some of my closest friends are women, I'm talking here about women I see around the city.) I don't even see them in a romantic/sexual way anymore - as potential future partners. They're too deserving of a proper man/woman/partner to be burdened with my BS. Consequently, my dating life has been and remains nonexistent, not only because I'm too broke to go anywhere but also because I simply can't hold a good conversation with people I don't already know. The older I get, the more this condition frustrates me. At 33, I've aged out of commiserating over life with fellow young, broke, and angsty misfits. Most of them have started to find their way, have begun to elevate their lives materially (e.g., house, car, family). Whereas I'm still struggling with basic-level things that people judge you for when you talk about them, so I don't. And therein lies the vicious cycle, the self-perpetuating isolation. \n\nDidn't intend for this post to be this long, so I commend those who actually took the time to read it. More of a therapeutic thing, than anything.\n\nCheers", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mms78f/re_living_alone_changes_your_brain/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mms78f/re_living_alone_changes_your_brain/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

If you don't want to read you don't have to I'm sorry. But like I just wanted to try my hand putting a stupid concern here. \n\nI am half Japanese half American and although I \nunderstand that I am privileged to live in America, I grew up visiting Japan often to see my grandparents. I would go every summer break for about 3 months especially when I was 12 to 18. Recently my grandmother passed and it made me confront some spoiled issues I have about where I come from. For me, although I am darker skinned, I never had any racial issues in Japan . I never had any issues of feeling objectified or as though I was a pariah. I knew being half black meant people would stare at me and I got used to the \"what is she mixed with and why doesn't she have a japanese accent?\" Stares. I got used to comments from Japanese people saying they thought black people were scary before meeting me and that I was the first black person to converse with. I didn't mind any of it since it was harmless in my eyes. I was more extroverted there as I got older and would speak to strangers who were shocked at me being mixed and able to speak the language so well and loved how polite they were. But so I was mainly in Japan for general living. And here for me was weird. I started working at a restaurant at 14 and got a decent amount of customers who loved making me uncomfortable even though they knew I was underage and when I went out even as I became older I felt like I was pedophile bait for people. I had white people put their weird Japanese fetish type comments in front of me and make me have to face the reality that some people will hear I'm Japanese and actually ask me questions about hentai. I knew that being approached randomly by men was a normal occurance in this country. It was supposed to be a compliment. I grew up with black people telling me I wasn't black enough which made me question things but ultimately I didn't care what they thought since I was also Japanese and I mean I was closer with my Japanese mother who to me was my favorite person. She was depressed when I was younger though and so we grew apart a bit over time as I felt guilt for having my own issues and didn't want to affect her due to her already having stress due to my father getting sick at one point really bad. Recently I has to stop driving due to not wanting to deal with a car that needed so many maintenence issues and not working for a bit due to having panic attacks for a while about a fear of men. My fears of men are extremely stupid and just from different things. I've had certain instances which I don't really consider that harmful since compared to others it wasn't\n\n much. Two different situations with two different guys who I guess had ulterior motives attempting to do things which I didn't realize and causing me to freeze and ultimately cry and only be able to get out \"stop \" repeatedly. Sure they should have I guess said stuff but also it was my fault for thinking they had no ulterior motives even though I didn't know them well enough and actually thinking they wanted to be friends. I was 19 at the time and really stupidly naiive. I thought that I was no longer pedophile bait which meant I wasn't going to have issues too much with men? But after that and some things I completely shut down in America. Whenever I was here I stopped wanting to interact with men at all unless for work. \n\nAnd then started the issues where I would panic with customers not knowing what to do about flirtatious advances out of fearing that they would somehow make it seem like I had flirted with them. I don't flirt. I never flirt. I don't know how to flirt. I don't want to flirt. But I am polite to the general public when I go out and I think that was my issue maybe? My dad originally taught me to smile at strangers and be friendly and it wasn't something that I think was good for a girl to learn in America. In Japan, sure maybe. In Japan I would be open and smiley and made friendships and had no issue there but in America it's like it put a weird target on my back by not filtering my smiles more. I love this country for the fact that my parents love me and chose to live here and I live under their roof but when my grandmother died so did my dream of getting to make \n\nup lost time by living near her. I would walk around my neighborhood in Japan oftentimes alone and feel extremely safe and loved the peace and quiet. In America I didn't live in the ghetto or anything but would have men at times approach on the street and it would cause me to walk myself back home and realize I had forgotten I wasn't supposed to be outside that much. Once cars started honking at times in this country I just wanted to cry and now I just despise the loudness and the aggressiveness of it all. If I see a loud car of a man smiling out of his window at me it makes me want to grit my teeth and spit at them even though I know that's harsh. But I had people literally ask for a phone number during my shift when I was 15 at let's say 6 pm and then once I was off my shift at a job right around the corner from my home at 10 pm there they were, \n\nwaiting for me and claiming it was a coincidence. Men at times making me know that married Christian men had no qualms with trying to get close to an underage girl and claim that they wanted to invite them places to help them \"learn\" whatever the crap we spoke about.  I had a customer who came in starting when i was 16 and asked how old i was (he was clearly over 30) and would flirt with me. After learning my age he switched over to asking me when i was turning 18. He was actually a customer until i turned 18 and at one point brought his son in to the store and introduced us. I was working though and got better and better at playing the game of customer service. Better and better and goijg around their comments without causing a scene in the small restaurant I worked at. And boy was I good at it. I would turn a polite smile on and act like I had no idea about their intentions but was declining an advance out of them being \"far too kind\" or whatever and putting up a barrier. I made sure to never seem flirty at all and never flirted for tips. I just was generally polite. But even if I had to go back I wouldn't know what I did wrong if I did do something wrong and I know I was stupid by not learning to get more upset . I didn't know I was allowed to I guess.  Later on just telling a coworker to take their order for me. The same coworker who I worked with starting at age 14 who when I turned 17 began to make comments about my \n\nbody and comparing it to his girlfriends who was Asian and \"flatter\". And ended up smacking my butt due to older Thai workers doing it and he said it was the same thing. Overtime he stopped when my boss found out but yeah I was too much of a freaking loser to say anything else when i told him to stop and he said he didnt have to since others could do it. My boss had us work different shifts for a bit and yeah we never spoke on it but it stopped. I wasn't someone with larger assets or anything I just freaking wore jeans to work and I didn't know even though skinny jeans were the trend that u needed to get into baggy jeans before the style got more popular later on. I just wore whatever I saw others wear Jean wise especially since I didn't care. Now I am living here and I just started riding the bus. I'm in a state where bus riding isn't like super common but I don't hate public transportation. In Japan the trains were my favorite to ride on since honestly I hate driving and really prefer getting to stare out of the window. I'm not a fan of cars and their upkeep and complications so I honestly feel amazing not having to drive. But Jesus. Because the reason why i stopped riding the bus ever was since the few times I rode as a \n\nunderage person I had a  person who I recognized often who would gradually attempt to get closer to me. I stopped liking bus stops altogether. Was he a stalker? I don't know. I just knew that he liked trying to know where I was headed and such. Yes I told him my age. Yes he said he wanted to just be friendly. I just stopped since I mean I could just stay home. My parents didn't necessarily enjoy giving me rides when I was younger after I turned 14 so I stopped hanging out with friends as much due to not wanting to bother them with asking. They were decently strict so they wanted to be introduced to parents at times before I was let out which was a weird thing to ask a friend in high school I learned so I just didn't bother. Didn't want to come off as a person with weird parents or whatever. But I really didn't mind since I didn't mind being \n\ninside. I was in America and being inside meant being away from people. Now I'm 23. I'm going back to school for software engineering and I'm really excited. I'm excited to ride the bus and not have to stop for gas and I'm excited to do in person classes knowing exactly what i want to study since for a had a hiatus when I was trying to figure out if I wanted to do farming during working at a plant nursery and learning about plants. But I was driving when I was working there and now I'm not. I bus to my job now and it isn't bad but God. Going anywhere decently dressed and on public transport feels like hell in this country for me. I am an idiotic 23 year old who freaking freezed up yesterday for 15 minutes after someone handed me a damn phone number on the bus since I couldn't deny it in time. I'm well aware that people being friendly and \n\nwanting to connect isn't a crime but oh my god in Japan I don't have to ever deal with any of this. I know it's terrible but I feel so stupid for spending 2 years learning about plants and enjoying a job in this country when I should have been just trying to save and get out. But at the same time I am aware that I may just be idolizing Japan far too much? I know that if I move there in the future it will come with it's own set of problems. But I just don't think that men will be part of that problem? I know that sounds maybe naiive and stupid but I'm seriously not even really attractive that much at all. I just weirdly stand out I'm pretty sure and people in America are very bold about randomly speaking to someone with starting out just asking \"ooo what are you mixed with\". In Japan people are taught to mind their own business and honestly yeah you're a weirdo if you randomly freaking approach people like that. I don't want to think like this too much though I really don't. I have issues and I know I need to get over them but I'mjust really tired. I know it's stupid but I'm two different people in this country and Japan. I'm open to making facial expressions when I'm out, I'm fine talking to random people since any guy I've spoken to has always been good with just speaking to me generally and not raising any flags. If someone hates my race I don't care since it just means I'm getting left alone. But am I crazy for this? Like am I the problem? I am not an extrovert and I'm not into making friends when I go out unless with women and even then I'm still cautious about phone contacts and have a second number due to having had issues with people in my phone and not leaving me alone after I did not want to speak to them. \n\nAnd one of the times when it was a guy wanting to send me self harm photos after no responses I just quit. He was a friend of a friend and so that's why I had lowered my guard but realized it was a mistake. Another time I didn't want to send a nudes to a classmate and had them spread a threesome rumor about me which I wasn't upset about but yeah it made me understand men in my phone is not something to take lightly. I don't want to be like this. I know this country has its good. I really do. I have girlfriends here who I love and who I can spend time with. But generally I love going out alone and now that I have to bus ride I just cross my fingers and hope for the best. Because I really don't want my love of public transportation taken from me again? I carry a knife and pepper spray but I'm just so used to going around in Japan with nothing but my phone and getting lost in the town and not worrying about it since I can ask friendly locals who will guide me. I literally got drunk once on accident in Japan at 16 due to making friends and not knowing the signs of a can being hard lemonade at a firework festival and they were males. And they laughed and helped me get back and were so freaked since they assumed I was their age due to me looking older. I apologized profusely of course and headed home on my own and had a salary man and 3 women throughout my trip help me get back home safely. It is a funny memory I have of a lovely fireworks festival and obviously I never repeated doing such a thing, you wouldn't catch me dead taking a drink from a man in this country ever. And I wouldn't have done it at that age if I was in Japan. Honestly I'm scared that I'm racist too. And \n\nI hate thinking that but I don't even know anymore. If I meet a Japanese man here I know I'd be way more willing to be friendly but since it's America I still would have way higher of a guard up. And I hate myself so much for that???? I really really have fond memories of train transportation and so  i love that the bus and dart remind me of that and i want to keep my fond memories. I know this all sounds stupid and honestly dont expect anyone to read this but if you do and care even a little enough to give any advice....thank you so so much. I dont smile when i go out anymore of course and can enjoy myself no smile needed and i dress modestly but i will not lie i enjoy long skirts and a japanese style of clothing so i may be wrong for that. I dont know. I just enjoy them. Also ive worn makeup since 15 due to having had acne at one point which my mom was very conscious of and being afraid of bullying type comments and so i would wear in order to cover any scars and such. I at one point did eyeliner to try and look older but it isnt much help and i dont enjoy the style. I dont wear heavy makeup at all and just try to look more \"mature\" i guess as to not attract weird people since i still get comments if i dont have enough on of looking under 18 which i have to suppress a devastated look since people say it as a compliment. But for me its really really not. I really really am not trying to sound conceited in this and i have no idea howbim percieved except knowing that my introverted personality and nervousness is probably a large source of my problems. I used to laugh when nervous but i am afraid of consequences when rejecting people since you often cant tell how people will take things and they may later on still watch ive learned. I am extremely freaking stupid but I'm 23 and have no idea who to ask this kind of stupid crap. And yes I will be going to a new therapist soon but seriously. How do I stop making Japan better than it is since it's literally just another country with its own problems and a place where my grandmother passed which makes me miss it more unfairly. Her death recently really affected me and made me have a stronger hatred for this country. At one point growing up I was studying to go to school permanently there in Japan. I was about 16 but my dad began calling over and over and discouraging me from it and I started giving up on the studies. I don't want to hate him for that since I know it might not have changed much or would have just made me encounter different issues but I never told my parents any of these kind of stupid issues when I was a kid and I think It stupidly affected me more than it should have. I'm so aware that this is just normal being a female and I have no reason to be mad. I know I'm supposed to be grateful when a random man compliments me when I'm out but I can't. I really can't and In Japan compliments are about my Japanese or height typically (5'7) and I hate myself so much for being so sensitive and stupid.  I feel like if i start getting more sensitive i will isolate from friends worse than i already do and just stay home unless im going to work or school and i really dont want to since i dont want to just stop enjoying times at parks and bookstores and museums just because im living here because honestly im not financially stable enough go live alone anytime soon and want to finish school here. I dont hate people i just have weird stranger danger due to being an introvert. Please help a stupid idiot if you feel like it,, feel free to give me harsh advice but if so please at least make it helpful to me. I know I need to grow up but I swear I've been trying but I can't help but have outside be intimidating here. But after my grandma dying I know her existence was a big part of me loving that country in general and that her not being there is going to give me new grief when I live there and I will feel alone due to it. I do enjoy my country really I just don't live in a place with enough green so it's a lot of buildings which for me Japan just always had a lot of green and I loved the walking space and the normalcy of bikeriding. Bike riding I can do here though since I mean it's fast and so I don't feel like I could get caught or anything. But I had my bike stolen last year so I'm not doing that. I tried to bike ride to a cafe out of determination to get a dessert and ended up stranded it was so stupid hahaha. And the roads stopped being bike available,,,, I hadn't ridden bikes far before so I made a stupid error gahahah. I was so proud though for getting there ultimately since like I have only one place in America right now that is a cafe and I can go at night without being a parnaoid weirdo 😭😭I'm Christian and find Muslim cafes to be pretty safe to go to at night which is nice. And yes...this idiot would go bike riding and walking to cages at night at times in Japan. So I love the night and streetlights and just wanted to feel back in Japan....ugh I'm so sorry to anyone who read this but thanks.\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mlkbn2/how_do_i_handle_being_mixed_and_feeling_alone_in/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mlkbn2/how_do_i_handle_being_mixed_and_feeling_alone_in/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

{"id": "1mljm3p", "subreddit": "alone", "created_utc": 1754724870, "author": "Front_Huckleberry_27", "title": "I can't tell if this is unhealthy or not", "selftext": "Hello. 23 f Growing up I wasn't someone who enjoyed an excess of sugar. I grew up with depression at times and was pretty bulimic and would oftentimes throw my food up in order to maintain a certain weight. I visited family overseas and something I enjoyed was having my grandmother praise me for my thinness. I know that it was unhealthy but at the time no one knew and I honestly felt it was simply a way to diet since I did not know I had an eating disorder. I just logically thought \"oh if I don't want to gain weight I can just eat then throw it up and so I get to taste the food and then just get rid of the aftermath!\" I seriously like...thought I discovered a good method to keep skinny. I know it sounds stupid but I couldn't help myself. I wanted to justify it in order to not have to feel as though I needed to seek help for it. But honestly I went on a healthy diet crazy which helped me gain a healthy amount of weight after prioritizing a higher protein intake and changing my diet to green smoothies and salads oftentimes. I had a mother who at one point when I was younger lied to get me to not have bad addictions by stating that I was allergic to artificial sugar and to alcohol. No I am not but I don't mind the lie since it was just to protect me. I have a stupid dilemma where...my grandmother recently passed. Me being in America and not being able to see her when she passed and only when she was unable to speak due to her being further in her cancer process kind of hit me in a weird way. This past year I've gotten depressed at times and although It isn't terrible since my fear of certain things has gotten better, I have realized that I had a new...problem? I can't tell if it's really a problem yet. My grandmother had diabetes and was addicted to sugar. She was overweight all of her life and I know that her getting comments about her weight contributed to her viewing my better as \"better\" due to its thinness. For me, being skinny isn't really something that I attain for appearances or anything. It is but not in the way of being accepted by society. It's me wanting to look a certain way and get a certain amount of praise about it from family. Especially when I visit them overseas. But now, my grandmother is gone and I started eating sugar...like a lot. I convinced myself I wasn't a fan of sugar too much growing up and so I never really thought much of it but now that I've been eating sweet treats and trying new ones such as middle eastern desserts, I realize that I'm growing a weird addiction to it and I don't know how much of it is contributed to my depression about her passing late last year. I stopped caring about eating healthy as much and only make sure that I still remain \"skinny\" since I want to look like the body that she praised but ultimately I don't know what that is anymore. I don't have a desire to eat healthy lately and can go some days just eating some ice cream and drinking a sweet tea called karak tea. I do it in a way where I don't do large portions though so I'm not gaining too much weight? I'll go like a day with barely a meal and a half and then the next day I'll just have sugar all day. If there is something sweet in front of me I cant say no to it even if I already feel nauseous. I have no idea what my problem is or if I even have a problem. Anytime I eat something sweet I think of her and how happy she looked eating sweets after my grandfather scolded her (even though he was the one who purchased) and it makes me think it's okay. In my mind I guess I'm like making up for lost time of eating a lot of sugar as a kid??? But I wasn't good with sugar before since it would make my head hurt easily and now that's even gone. I used to be so quick to say \"this is too much \" and turn something away and know all thougt goes out the window. I can workout and all but I just want my grandmother and I can't get that so I at least feel like I deserve to feel a connection to her and I guess my way of doing that is sugar? I'll sometimes feel guilty about eating too much and worry about my weight for a couple of days but then I'll start up and I just have no limit once I start and I'm unsure of how to handle it since I never grew up with a sugar problem. I don't know how much is too much since it's all just about maintaining a certain \"look\". A look which was  based off of my grandmother's comments which I would look forward to once a year especially. Now it's gone. Sure I hated how she didn't like her own body since I found her to be adorable and gorgeous as my family and favorite family but ultimately I don't have anything against getting bigger. I just didn't want to based on her not liking it. Personally? I don't care. I don't know how to care. I just want to feel less alone and for the first time I feel like instead of starving myself, eating things that I know are topped off with a crap ton of sugar is doing that for me. Is this not good? How do I know when it's too unhealthy? It's been about 8 months since this started and it started with cafes as the only place since I would limit myself to going to a cafe only for deserts but it's gotten worse and I've been purchasing sweet deserts and drinking things sweetened with condensed milk and making it so that the last thing I taste in the day is something filled with sugar. I'm so sorry this sounds stupid and it was unnecessarily long. It's my first time grieving a death and it's getting better with time but I only had one set of grandparents alive and now 1 out of 2 is gone and so I just don't know how to handle it. I feel stupid for asking but yeah. Idk. I don't typically get lonely since I'm introverted but I know I'm lonely right now since I know that I miss her a lot and that I can't dream of making up time with her by living there in the future near her. I stupidly thought she'd still be alive when I got older and regret not having moved close sooner since now she's gone and although we had our time it wasn't enough for me and nothing will be. I can hide this issue from people right now just fine but i already knew starving myself was a habit out of sadness but i never had a sugar craving get this bad for this long. I thought it was a addiction to a certain dessert but its clearly not and its getting worse for me. Before her passing i would literally buy a bar of chocolate and drink a cup of tea with one tiny piece of it to enjoy myself and now i just end up eating everything and getting irritated if i cant have more and then crying over my grandmother at times and then blocking things out before finding more sugar later. I don't know what this is.  Please help this idiot?

I look in the mirror and wonder if maybe I’m too fat, or too ugly, or just too annoying with the things that I like. \n\nThere’s a boy that I think about always who never falls short of finding someone else to be in love with. It makes my heart ache.\n\nI keep trying to keep myself in good spirits thinking that it’s for a reason. But even in my thoughts I’m lonely and have nothing to talk to myself about.

My name is Ruslan, i live in Russia and i am turning 32 by the end of august. I had a broken family as my parents divorced when i was 2, i lived with my mother and she was addicted to alcohol so i basically grew up on the street, like a grass. I had brother and sister but they had another father, they both were older than me and as i said they were children from her previous marriage. \n\nThe problem i had even during my childhood is difficulty to find common language even with my family, they all felt alien, like we dont even related. We always fough and argued about everything, they also expressed their hatred towards me as my dad have central asian origin and moved here in late 70s (while it was USSR), he stayed after the collapse. I did tried to keep contact with my dad, but it was difficult since he had a new family. Up until the age of 8 he always took me for holidays, and the women he married had a son, that son was also older than me. They lived in another city. Thats where i experienced total abuse, for example, he made me eat bread with his snot, strangled me with a pillow, or just beat me up. All that was happening outside of parent eyes as they were at work most of the time and i was left for that guy mercy. I obviously complained about that, but it always was been dismissed, while the guy was even more angry, and now unpunished. Then i heard my dad and his wife arguing about wether or not he should take me here, she was all against that. I waited for my dad and then asked him to drive me back my mother, he refused so i decided to take a 40km walk. Half way after i walked for 20-25km road patrol found me and after some questioning they drove me to my mom. Thats how i cut contant with my father, he tried to reach me after and talk to me, but i ultimately refused.\n \nNow when my mother is in full control and have good leverage on my dad regarding the communication with me, it got from bad to worse. Over the next years it kept escalating, my sister gave a birth so they all were busy with a baby now, while i faced all their anger, constantly. Speaking of school tho i did good, had all the best grades, and it was like that until my 5th year at school. Yet another hysterical scream, another drama for no reason, another anger attack idk, but that time, my mom said things that stuck in my head to the rest of my life, she always screamed at me, poiting that im \"non-russian\" or as we say \"churka\", calling me stupid, useless, now she began questioning my very existance and saying things like \"i should have made an abortion instead\" and she kept saying that over and over again. I was crying and shaking, it felt terrible, drowning in tears, so i was also mocked for that. They did mocked me for crying so i havent cried in decades by now, i feel ticklish in the nose, like im a out to sneeze, for example, but nothing coming out. \n\nSo i lost any will to live, any motivation to study, i sometimes ran away from home for a week and was begging for food or just eating whatever edible junk i can put my hands on, gladly there was warehouse near, so they used to throw out alot of expired food. \n\n Time goes forward, i start skipping school, began hanging out with local \"gopnicks\", a lowlife criminals with adidas tracksuits and squatting all the time, i began smoking cigarettes and drinking vodka, i was about 15 by now. We beat some people, robbed some shops, they also used to throw rocks in a police cars just for a fun, and then being chased after, literally for fun. It wasnt fun for me tho, it all felt wrong, these guys had no concept of consequences for things they do. I did tried to distance away from them, but as socially awkward as i am, no normal kids would talk to me, no party will accept and theres no refuge at home. I kept hanging out with them but avoided any participation in their immoral activities, which they considered as cowardish, it didnt help, to say tue least.\n\nAnd then sudden stomach pain, whats is this? Probably nothing, got used to that. Next day pain didnt left, i told her that, she called an ambulance. Ambulance said its 100% appendicitis, we packed essentials, and got to the hospital. We were waiting for about an hour before doctor was able to see me (time was about midnight), he said its nothing serious, gave me painkiller and we were free to go, i felt like i am creating the problems for her, i was afraid that she would get even more angry. We got home but after an hour pain came back, i wasnt saying anything until it become unbearable, she called an ambulance again, another brigade came and they said the same thing - pack your things its 100% appendicitis. Same hospital, same doctor, same outcome. We got home again, same story happened. 3rd ambulance came, it was early morning by now, all the same things - pacnlk your stuff. Same hospital, same doctor, but this time ambulance girls were with us, they insisted and another doctor said that diagnostic surgery is needed, they got me into operational theatre (hope didnt mess up that term) put on the table, some mask and i fell asleep. I woked up in ICU learning that i had peritonitis and nearly died. Next 2 weeks i spent there and it was the only time when they seemed like cared about me, my mother visited me multiple times. Meanwhile deepdiwn i jnew that it is either temporary or fake, i know her my whole life, ahe never been like that, could she change like that? Later i was transfered to a usual hospital room where i was triednto walk again, as you can imagine after 2 weeks of icu its very difficult to even keep the balance while standing. Visits regularoty dropped after the transfer and \"good old\" mom was coming back more and more. I also have to point out that smartphones wasnt really a thing, i had siemens c65, so there was no internet like today, and obviously indidnt had laptop or even desktop at home, didnt even knew how computer works and hownto use it, despite it was somewhat widely available. At some point i just crashed out in that hospital, i refused to take medication, refused to eat, kept silence, i was tired if these white walls and bunch of people around was very stressing. I tried to run away but security guard caught me right at the exit door.\n  \nI was released home and things were quiet, i still wasnt able to normally walk and walked like an old person, barely moving. she even followed (actually cooked and made sure i eat it properly) my diet - only boiled and minced foods without salt. \n \n Fast forward, i recovered, everyhting went back to default. I still tried to distance away from these local guys, problem was that everyone knew each other and it wasnt easy to just hide away, and we all were living next to each other as well. Somehow we got our first PC, it was some old celeron barely could run games like GTA San Andreas, but this machine that became my escape tool. Being home was still difficult and they used that PC aswell, so i played games while it was available, and get outside less frequently. All was fun and games until another incident. I heard a noise outside my flat, it was around september 2011 by that time i barely finished school (they almost kicked me) and and it was my second year in a college. I went outside and i saw two guys, i knew them, they were the same party i hanged out before. With them there was a third one, he looked drunk. The third one was smashing cars in apparently drunk rage, he also held a knife, and two guys i knew tried to s as he broke the headlight of a car that belinged to one of them. I was staying far i asked whats goin on, they told me not to approach cuz if knife, moment later they jumped kn him and tried to disarm, hr somehow sliced one of them and second guy retreats, i run towards then guy he sliced and tried to help him stand, while the drunk one charged at me, he grabbed my sleeve but i found a bounder on the ground and began smashing his head with that bounder, he fell on the groundz then third guy came back witha iron pipe and \"finished\" the laying man. I got scared thinking we might have just killed him, i ran away home and was watching from the window how police and ambulance came. \n\nWeek later police came for me, twonother was in a jail already, and they began \"investigation\". Long story short -, the whole case was made up, the man insisted that i was asking him money, and i was following him from tue bus stop, he was insisting it was me and there was 3 of us, while in reality it easnt even a thing. He also declared that all his possesions were stolen, which again, did not happen, he had a bag - but nobody touched it. The two guys unfortunately as lowlife crimi as they are, im sure has been previously charged for such things. The case itself was very very scatchy, things doesnt make sense, something wrong. Later turned out that \"wrong\" was involving corrution schemes and connections, as it turned out the family of that man, of his wife to be more specific - are rich family known in the city, and during it was visible that the man doesnt even remember what happened that night, and judge didnt asked him amy extra questions, even for evidence that je had possesions stolen, instead were focused on us. Prosecution asked for max - 16 years of jail for each. Tirned out to be 8 years for those two guys and 4, years of probation for me, as i was a minor (i was 17). Now i really really felt like my life is over, andit just could not ve worse. Boy, how wring was i. These two accused me of snitching on them, and working with police against them,  specifically about the part with iron pipe - i told them full story without lying during my interrogation, but with the pipe they catched me, i knew it was fucked up so i confessed only that i was beating a man with a stone as he was about to put knife into my body. I guess i did helped them to be in jail to some extent. It was my first time dealing with police, or being involved with law problems at all (the consequences of it, atleast).\nVery painful that i knew i have to cut the ties with them years before, but it is impossible without any help, or just another group of kids i can hang out with, the normal ones. \n\nThey ended up spreading that info to all the locals, so the locals were out for a hunt. It was a total disaster, i could not stay home as everyone there essentially hates me and i cant go outside cuz everyone wana beat the shit out of me. I got out couple of times, tried to reason with them, but they were out for blood so they beat the fick out of me couple times, took my phone as a \"payment\" and said i owe them money now. I locked myself at home, and for 8 years i wasnt speaking to anyone, ignored everyone, sometimes wasnt eating for a week cuz mother always was angry about me eating food \"u didnt earned it - get a job u useless\".\n\nI ended up in a full escapism mode, fortunately neighbour gave me his old pc, he said it was broken completely, \"if u fix it - its yours\". Turned just the power button was unplugged from the motherboard. So i had this core2quad and gt9500 for many years, instill have it - this core2quad are on my key chain now XD. \n\nSo 8 years i spent in total isolation, isolation that i thought will never ends. At some point i was so full of everything, mother had yet another crashout and i was so tired of ignoring it, i screamed at her so bad that i lost voice for a week, and thay was probabky the first time in my life that i raised my voice like that towards her, she got angry and tried to slap me but i held her hands after the first slap so she just screamed very loud. Later a grabbed a knife and locked myself in the bathroom, i was so ready to end it once and for all, first in did a small cut on my hand, trying to measure how will it be, indont want more pain, i want to get rid of pain. I got scared to do even this pathetic act. I wish i was stronger and not sabotaged my own life, but whats done is done. So i never had real friends, i never had a person that i can share things with. Never had girlfriend, it is difficult to find someone who would just unconditionally talk to me, how would i find someone who would volunteer to tie her life with such failure as myself? Nobody needs an ugly weak loser man. \n\n I somehow found enough willpower, with nowhere to go and noone to rely on i contacted my father. I needed a job, in the alien city, away from that place. He helped me with that, i moved out, we talk sometimes but i still refuse any contact with his family, despite he inviting me to his birthdays and new year celebrations. \n\n7 years passed, i quit smoke and didnt had alcohol in my mouth for atleast 15 years, bought a small apartment, trying to refurbish now, i also adopted a kitty, this kitty 3 years old now and very nasty creature, always looking for things to break. Whatever makes the child happy.\n\nI am ready to die alone. I dont want to, i dont like it, but that seems to be the only way to go. -\"Im tired, boss\". Thank you for reading this, please dont judge me for my decisions, past events and country of birth. \n\nAlso my english is rubbish but i am trying my best, im sorry for grammatical mistakes and typos i might have done.\n", "score": 4, "num_comments": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mi6430/sentenced_to_loneliness_my_life_as_a_social/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mi6430/sentenced_to_loneliness_my_life_as_a_social/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

I spent a lot of the past year actually just crippled with guilt and self consciousness of it all. I also ended up quitting/getting fired from the job I thought my future was in. I tried to apologize and go back to some old friends, old communities, go back to the mental health community I was apart of... 1 person replied to an apology. The rest ignored me. Even some people who hadn't given up on me won't respond to messages or just are generally non-conversational. So currently, I'm working at Wal-Mart newly and my weeks consist of sleeping, going to work, coming home... rinse repeat. I never talk to anyone outside my home/work. People at work treat me like I'm weird because I am quiet/just trying to get through the day. I struggle really bad with depression and anxiety. I am blessed in my housing/money situation but I can't feel it. I don't feel anything so frequently... I spend a lot of time in my own head. People make going out and finding new life/new friends sound so easy. Maybe for some people it is. There are so many life instances where people say, \"You just have to do it.\" and it really just stresses me out. Being lonely everyday is really getting to me. But I just feel like in a hole with no way out. Even though I felt guilty about my behavior last year, now I feel kind of sad and angry that people gave me 0 understanding, 0 empathy... as soon as I was struggling, and I WAS struggling, people started ignoring me. My best friend for some years won't return my messages. It's hurtful. We did a lot together and I did a lot for him. When I was going through stuff last year, he went and told all sorts of people and communities about it. I felt so embarrassed because it just put my life out there for everyone to see. I always felt in my life, especially as a kid, that I noticed socially some people got treated more poorly than others. I didn't realize I could some day be that person...  be the quiet, anxious, awkward person that people seem to forget, make fun of, feel uncomfortable around... Having a friend who emailed every month or so... having friends to talk to during work week... having family around... having online friends... I just feel as though I didn't appreciate those things enough when I had them. I know it is cliche to say nobody would care if I was gone... but that's really how I feel. I just feel like I inconvenience people by even being alive/existing. I know some of these things are my own viewpoint on it and sometimes that takes personal work but I have been like this for some time and it just... life feels really empty.

It was the first time I truly started building a life for myself, away from the manipulation, away from the emotional chaos. I had a job, a home, a dog, a sense of peace I had never known before.\n\nDuring my entire pregnancy, I was alone. There was no interest from my daughter’s father. A few weeks after she was born here in Cambodia, my abusive ex showed up and demanded to take her. I told him no, not because I was trying to keep her from him, but because I didn’t trust him. I told him he needed to earn my trust first, that he was welcome to visit her, but I wasn’t going to just hand her over. That made him angry. He was a narcissist, and things only got worse from there.\n\nTo protect my daughter and myself, I gave up everything: my job, my house, my dog, the life I had worked hard to build over the years, the first life I ever made for myself. I left it all behind and returned to my home country, hoping for safety. My mom had told me I could live with her, and even though I didn’t really want to, her words gave me enough hope to make that decision.\n\nBut when I arrived, I couldn’t stay with her after all. I didn’t even bother asking my dad (he’s a narcissist who used me against my mom for years) and he immediately said I couldn’t stay with him. He blamed my stepmother, but I knew it was really his choice. So I ended up in a homeless shelter with my newborn daughter. It was one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life. I felt so incredibly guilty as a mom, guilty that I couldn’t even give my daughter a roof over her head. That guilt ate at me every day, even though I had done everything I could to keep her safe.\n\nWhat hurt the most was that no one, not once in my entire life, had ever said to me, “It’s okay, I’m here for you.” It seems like such a normal thing. So many people can go to their parents when they need help. I’ve never had that. And it hurts me to my core.\n\nBecause finding stable housing in my home country can take up to 10 years, I decided to return to Asia (back to Cambodia) a place where life is easier and I could build again. And slowly, I did. I got my job back, I got my house back, I even got my dog back. I rebuilt everything from the ground up.\n\nBut now, with tensions rising in the region (Thailand-Cambodia), I’m feeling unsafe again. And again, I find myself in a situation where I don’t know if I am safe. My mom has already said I can’t stay with her, and I don’t even have to ask my dad, I know the answer.\n\nMeanwhile, people around me are starting to leave. At work, colleagues ask if I’ll go home to my parents, if they’ve called, if they’re checking in on me, and I have to say no, with tears in my eyes, because I don’t have that.\n\nAnd what breaks my heart the most is this: as a mom, even in a situation where war could break out, I would never, could never, imagine turning my child away. I can’t understand it. And it hurts me to my bones that I was never given that kind of love. I should have had a safe place. I should have been able to stay. But no one ever said, “I’m here for you.”\n\n\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mb8evr/deeply_hurt/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/alone/comments/1mb8evr/deeply_hurt/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}

Gabby and her brother Mario were so scared, I bought spare blankets over and read books.

I feel like I'm not a good person anymore because I lost their friendship and because of how they treat me. Then there's my parents. To be fair they've always been abusive, but it's gotten so much more intense since they had to move in with all of us and they always take the girls' side, only come in to emotionally stress vomit on me then leave, and never come in to sit with me or like watch something of mine (i'm bedbound and they have a lifelong record of never and i mean never watching any media of mine no matter how short or how much better it would've made me feel it's only their shows). Then when they do come in, they're so mean. The scream at me and then tell me it's because I was lecturing them. \"Lecturing\" yesterday, was me vomiting neon yellow, angry, undigested stomach contents and acid into a pot and my father completely ignoring me and just having fun with the cat. And I don't mean like he had an arm on me or was being comforting, I mean like I wasn't even there. Just like always. Like even when I'm sick as a dog and trying not to aspirate vomit they find reasons to scream at me. I have literally *no one.* And as  a disabled person that physically needs other people to survive this is like the worst possible situation. It just makes me feel like I must be a bad person? Because if I'm not a bad person then why are things like this happening?
