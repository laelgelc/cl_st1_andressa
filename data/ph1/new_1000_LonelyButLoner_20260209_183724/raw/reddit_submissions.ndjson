I’m starting to think I’m broken because I want a partner so badly but 2/3 times I’ve had one in the past I got bored or lost feelings for one reason or another and broke up with them after 1-2 months.\n\nThe only meaningful relationship I’ve ever had was when I was 14-17y/o and it was over the internet with a girl my age who lived across the country. We never got to meet in person and she never wanted to reconnect after the initial break-up.\n\nI don’t know what’s wrong with me but I’ve been alone since I was 18(?) and have kind of just accepted this as a sign that maybe I’m just meant to be alone and do my own thing until I eventually grow old and whither away with nobody.\n\nEDIT: \n\nIt’s 2026 now and I’ve managed to somehow hold down a person who actually thinks I’m interesting and even admitted that they’ve been watching me from a distance for a few years now. They just started talking to me about a year ago now and in December 2025 I asked to make us official and they said yes. \n\nI’ve leaned since originally making this post that: \n\nA. It’s okay to be alone. Being alone didn’t make me unlovable or a waste or uninteresting. Once I accepted that and just moved on doing my own thing in life I started making myself happy again (by spending all my cash on plastic figures 💀) and I got out of the headspace that I was hopeless and lonely. I just focused on being myself unapologetically! \n\nB. Even if you are with people- you can still feel lonely. And it’s okay. Feeling lonely is normal and not something you should dwell on because it isn’t all you are. You FEEL lonely but you can FEEL other ways, too. Some introspect, beginning some kind of hobby or maybe therapy can help you if you feel like you can’t get out of that lonesome feeling. \n\nThat’s kind of all I’ve really come to accept when I was feeling lonely. I still prefer to be by myself a lot but I don’t feel so alone anymore. Not in a dark way like before. I hope that this lasts and I hope whoever reads this also finds that equilibrium with their loneliness, too.

I'm not too awkward to talk to anyone, I just find most interactions with other people to be unpleasant so I avoid talking to other people as much as I can. I'm not shy at all when there's some need for me to say something to someone-- even a stranger-- but without the pretext or need I find that I have nothing to say to anyone.\n\nThe problem is that humanity, in general, disgusts me. I imagine others to be the same as me which makes me thoroughly uninterested in anything they have to say. And I know that they'd be equally uninterested in my boring chatter. And if they're not, they're idiots. Who wants to be friends with idiots?\n\nI haven't dated for years for the same reasons. I'm just not interested in putting myself in the position of having others approve or disapprove of me. Fuck them. Who are they to judge me?\n\nI'd like to say that I don't need anything from anyone, but there's-- despite all of this-- the loneliness. So I find myself in a position of wanting nothing to do with other people yet wishing someone else was around. A 'placeholder', I call him/her. And I can't even imagine what the ideal placeholder would even be like. I've tried forcing myself to find and befriend this person, but I hang out with placeholder candidates and would ALWAYS rather be alone. On top of that, I have a lot of projects. Friends require time that it's just not worth it to give them when I don't even really like them.\n\nI was hoping for an AI revolution, wherein I could have a 'friend' with a customizable personality, a little decent conversation from time to time and the ability to turn them them off/save my progress when I don't feel like dealing with them. Doesn't look like that's going to occur anytime soon though.\n\nI'm fairly convinced that the loneliness is hard-wired, because I KNOW that people aren't anything I want to be around. I'm trying to figure out a way to game the system though, like a vitamin supplement but for human interaction; a way to enjoy the emotional and psychological benefits of human connection without having to subject myself to the awfulness of other people.\n\nIdeas?", "score": 29, "num_comments": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LonelyButLoner/comments/hq9zdw/i_dont_know_if_i_belong_here_you_tell_me/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/LonelyButLoner/comments/hq9zdw/i_dont_know_if_i_belong_here_you_tell_me/", "over_18": false, "removed_by_category": null}
