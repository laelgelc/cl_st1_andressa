Now, I am at peace and only wish to share what the Force has taught me, with others who are lost as I was. Do not think I am saying worship Star Wars, I am a Jedi, not a lightsaber nerd, Jedi comes from Jidaigeki which is a word for Japanese Historical Stories, so Jedi means knowledge of history. A Jedi is the keeper of peace and history, we use words, ideas, and knowledge, and are led to these things by the force. I cannot take credit for what I know, because I have faith in the Force, which some call intuition or instinct, but I know I am being led by something far greater than myself. If I was crazy, I would be living a worse life, not a better one. The one thing that does make me feel a little crazy, is that people would rather see my good intentions as crazy or self-promotion, instead of realizing, there are far better ways to get famous, why would I say such things unless I believed them? Religion never worked for me, and then it hit me, and all the knowledge from my childhood fantasies, synced up with what I know about real religions, and real spirituality, if these concepts and labels, help me understand something that is both improving my life, and also, enables me to find a true faith that I never knew I could have, how is this wrong or crazy? I guess, you have to be out on a ledge, for a really long time, before you start becoming grateful for the things that make you realize, what the fuck am I doing on a Ledge, I got an Xbox and Playstation, I got skills and talents, life is not so bad, why am I not finding a way to be happy? The Darkside does not want us to be happy, and it makes us lazy, it lies to us, distorts the truth, and makes us hate ourselves, it makes us long for release from suffering, when we can end our own suffering through the choice to find happiness.

You tell me.","selftext":"I don't know if I belong here. I'm not too awkward to talk to anyone, I just find most interactions with other people to be unpleasant so I avoid talking to other people as much as I can. I'm not shy at all when there's some need for me to say something to someone-- even a stranger-- but without the pretext or need I find that I have nothing to say to anyone.\n\nThe problem is that humanity, in general, disgusts me. I imagine others to be the same as me which makes me thoroughly uninterested in anything they have to say. And I know that they'd be equally uninterested in my boring chatter. And if they're not, they're idiots. Who wants to be friends with idiots?\n\nI haven't dated for years for the same reasons. I'm just not interested in putting myself in the position of having others approve or disapprove of me. Fuck them. Who are they to judge me?\n\nI'd like to say that I don't need anything from anyone, but there's-- despite all of this-- the loneliness. So I find myself in a position of wanting nothing to do with other people yet wishing someone else was around. A 'placeholder', I call him\/her. And I can't even imagine what the ideal placeholder would even be like. I've tried forcing myself to find and befriend this person, but I hang out with placeholder candidates and would ALWAYS rather be alone. On top of that, I have a lot of projects. Friends require time that it's just not worth it to give them when I don't even really like them.\n\nI was hoping for an AI revolution, wherein I could have a 'friend' with a customizable personality, a little decent conversation from time to time and the ability to turn them them off\/save my progress when I don't feel like dealing with them. Doesn't look like that's going to occur anytime soon though.\n\nI'm fairly convinced that the loneliness is hard-wired, because I KNOW that people aren't anything I want to be around. I'm trying to figure out a way to game the system though, like a vitamin supplement but for human interaction; a way to enjoy the emotional and psychological benefits of human connection without having to subject myself to the awfulness of other people.\n\nIdeas?","selftext_word_count":414,"score":29,"num_comments":5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LonelyButLoner\/comments\/hq9zdw\/i_dont_know_if_i_belong_here_you_tell_me\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/LonelyButLoner\/comments\/hq9zdw\/i_dont_know_if_i_belong_here_you_tell_me\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_LonelyButLoner_20260209_183724\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

But honestly? Lately, I’ve just been feeling incredibly lonely.\n\nI spend a lot of time in my own head, creating, thinking, overthinking... and while I love art and everything that comes with it — music, games, food, meaning, love, self-care, even things like home building and gardening — none of it really fills that space where human connection should be.\n\nI’m an empath, which makes it even harder sometimes. I feel people deeply, but lately it feels like there’s no one around to feel with, if that makes sense.\n\nI guess I’m just reaching out, hoping to find someone who understands what that kind of loneliness feels like. Someone who doesn’t mind slow conversations, deep thoughts, or just existing quietly together when the words aren’t there.\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, even a little, I’d love to talk.

I don't really have a close circle of friends and find myself isolating more and more. I seem to lack motivation and can't really find happiness in the  stuff I used to do.  I struggle with depression and anxiety and not being around people is taking  its toll.  The usual, \"get out there and do something, join  a gym,  a book club etc doesn't resonate with me.  I struggle to find ways to pass the time but just end up watching TV or looking for things to join in. I used to have a bunch of friends at work but because of circumstances I've lost them all. I'm looking for help. Not advice per se, that doesn't seem to get me anywhere for some reason.  Maybe just to make connections. Hope someone reads this.

I left behind all my friends since I came alone because I am the only one of the group who went to study. So now I am in a new city where I do not know anyone, except for the two guys I met at uni. The thing is that the loneliness is kinda kicking in me, the two guys that I met are cool but is not like we hang out of uni or nothing and to be honest we do not have that much in common. I feel like I do not have a lot in common with all the people in my carreer, at least not enough to hang out or anything like that, I guess that the fact that I am practically the only guy there is a big influence to that feeling. Anyway, what worries me the most is that I do not feel like I am doing what an 18 year old should do, and I am very aware that I am only going to be 18 once. Since I am sharing my feelings I thing that a big component to this way I feel is the fact that I am still a virging, which is not the usual scenario to my age. I don't even think that being a virgin at my age is that weird but since I am in a new city alone that sentiment is making me feel pretty bad because that adds to my feeling of 'not doing what a young person should do\". I thought about going to a psychologist but I do not even know how could a professional help me with this. If someone could tell give me advice or whatever that would be helpful.

I was getting promoted at my job, had a good amount of friends, a beautiful girl was interested in me, and I was finally getting my life on track. Then everything went to shit.\n\nThe promotion never came cuz of high turnover. I started school so work and school together ruined my social life. A lot of my friends slowly lost touch with me. The girl I loved was in college on the other side of the country but was moving back near me soon, so I was excited to see her again and ask her out. But turns out she was just trying to fuck and when I told her that I liked her and thought she liked me, she simply responded that ‘like’ is a strong word and she doesn’t catch feelings for people. \n\nSo I quit my job at the end of last year and lost my friends I had there. And I lost a girl that was everything to me because it turns out I was nothing to her. And I stopped working out because of my depression I fell into. I cut myself off from the world.\n\nNow I’m trying to get it together which is terrifying. I got a new job which seems cool enough but the people there kinda suck. I’m back to working out but I can’t lift anywhere near what I could a few months ago and my body is in deep pain. I’m gonna go back to school in the summer. But no real friends besides a couple roommates. Not a great relationship with my family. A significant other seems laughable to me at this point. It just sucks because I wanted to die for so long and stopped caring. Now I’m slowly trying to get my life together, but the pain is still there and there’s no signs of it going away. No matter what I just get the feeling that I’ll never be seen as worth anyone’s time and not be good enough for anything I try to do in this world.","selftext_word_count":359,"score":3,"num_comments":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/11oofig\/i_dont_know_if_i_can_ever_be_enough\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/11oofig\/i_dont_know_if_i_can_ever_be_enough\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_LonersEmpire_20260209_183758\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I was happy to see many replies and personal messages saying that it helped a bit with their loneliness. It was also interesting to see almost 2000 anonymous logs, and all the different reasons for their loneliness.\n\nAs you might expect, many felt lonely because they lacked romantic partners, closely followed by not having friendship. What was interesting though was what they thought attributed to their loneliness. Many found communication skill as what was holding them back, almost twice as many as those who said physical appearance was the cause.\n\nI wanted to do more with the webapp so that people don't just post how they feel like their shouting into the void, but actually verbally talk to others in similar situations so that they can work on their communication skill AND actually make meaningful connections with people across the globe.\n\nI was sprint-coding for the past 2 weeks so that I can have this audio chat feature ready by Valentines Day because I know this day can hurt so much for people without someone to spend with. I wanted to have it ready before Midnight, my apologies.\n\nI added a feature in the audio chat where, when you talk to someone and enjoy the conversation, you can send them a rose 🌹, which the receiver can use as a way to find you another day to continue the conversation.\n\nI plan to be on the platform for most of the day on V Day. I would love to talk to you as I have also previously suffered from loneliness and I vowed to myself to create something to help others who might be going through similar things now.\n\nIf you want to check it out, you can visit lonelyworld <dot> info (use . for <dot>)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllow me to end this by wishing you Happy Valentines Day.","selftext_word_count":340,"score":8,"num_comments":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/1120nnv\/i_built_a_website_to_help_lonely_souls_find_each\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/1120nnv\/i_built_a_website_to_help_lonely_souls_find_each\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_LonersEmpire_20260209_183758\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

The idea was to allow a lonely person to report their loneliness anonymously and share their location on the map so that other people visiting the website can see that there are lots of people across the world going through the same thing.\n\nThe engagement was fantastic. There were over 700 visitors and more than 150 people reported being lonely. We actually saw people from all 7 continents - Antarctica reporting loneliness. \n\nIf the website was of any small help or consolation for anyone, I wanted to do more to help out. \n\nI since added a limited chat function so that people can share why they feel lonely, and how they are coping with it today. People who do not feel lonely can also contribute by sharing their past experiences and leaving suggestions.\n\nI think the first part of overcoming loneliness, or any problem for that matter, starts from recognizing the issue and identifying the factors leading up to the problem. I hope The Lonely World can help people with this first part.\n\nPlease feel free to check out the website and share any feedback. \n\n[https:\/\/lonelyworld.info](https:\/\/lonelyworld.info\/)\n\nCheers,","selftext_word_count":211,"score":8,"num_comments":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/10n9j0a\/i_updated_the_lonely_world_website_because_it\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/10n9j0a\/i_updated_the_lonely_world_website_because_it\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_LonersEmpire_20260209_183758\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I’m a 21M and have a similar story to many of you in the group: still a virgin, had a couple kisses but never a good one, been on a couple of dates that went nowhere, etc. Now I look back to summer of last year with deep pain. During that time I was really getting it together: I was about to be promoted at my job, school was going well for me for once, I was getting in the gym almost every day and gaining confidence, and I met a girl that I was instantly intrigued by. This girl was incredibly beautiful to me and shared a lot of my interests, and quickly she gravitated to me while we worked together. She was pretty shy but would take the time to talk to me and always greeted me with this amazing smile. But by the time the summer ended, she left across the country to college. I tried to keep in touch as much as I could, but then life got crazy for me too. Balancing school with work became an intense challenge, working out fell off as a result, and the promotion I was looking forward to fell through because they were understaffed. Then this girl moved back close to me and when we saw each other again, she quickly became flirty. One night we were sexting and she was planning to come over the next night, but those plans fell through and life was getting busy again so it was my last chance to see her for awhile. I became impatient and spilled all my feelings for her and she pretty much told me that she doesn’t catch feelings for people. I got drunk a night later and drunk texted her some nasty and forceful things and got blocked. So here I am, thinking just last week that something special was finally happening for me, but instead feeling as hopeless and lost as ever. I quit that job as it took a huge toll on me, still in school but have no idea where that will lead, and have been isolating myself and not working out. All my motivation in life feels lost because it seems like when things are coming together, everything eventually crumbles.","selftext_word_count":389,"score":1,"num_comments":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/1072wt9\/scared_of_life_ahead\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/LonersEmpire\/comments\/1072wt9\/scared_of_life_ahead\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_LonersEmpire_20260209_183758\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I’m posting because I feel stuck between grief and survival and could really use some perspective.\n\nI moved to Las Vegas to live with my cousin. He was my roommate and a huge part of my support system. Unexpectedly, he passed away. Losing him alone has been devastating but what made it even harder was that his passing left me and my dog with only about two weeks to figure out where to live and what to do next.\n\nLuckily for me i have a really strong support system back in Texas so i know im loved. I sometimes feel guilty because i know they worry because im a young woman 1000s of miles away from my birth family.

Its like i’ll look around my new home and feel completely displaced even though i love it.\n\n I’ve been trying to stand on my own in a city that still feels like home but I don’t have family here, and my circle is very small. Most days it’s just me, my dog & sometimes my boyfriend , navigating grief quietly while the world keeps moving.\n\nI’m also an aspiring nail tech, currently working toward building a future for myself. I love the craft and the creativity, but some days it’s incredibly hard to stay motivated when everything feels unstable and emotionally heavy. I’m grieving someone I moved here for, while also trying not to let my life completely unravel.\n\nI guess I’m just trying to figure out how people do this — how you process loss while being forced to grow up fast ( just turned 27 yesterday ) , relocate fast, and keep showing up for your goals.

I am 20-year-old college student majoring in music. I made friends fast in freshman year. It seemed like everyday was a new adventure. I hung out with so many different people, I felt so happy.\n\nEvery year, It seems like everyone is busier, which makes sense.\n\nI started my junior spring semester last week and I'm so lonely. Everyone has tight knit friendroups and I'm not in any. I walk around my campus like a ghost. I have no friends in my classes. I try to join conversations, but it's obvious I don't belong. No one texts or calls, there seems to be hang outs, I just never hear about them. I try to keep myself busy these days by getting a job and taking harder courses, but it doesn't replace having a social life. I feel like I'm always on the outside. In a group of three with me, there's a duo I'm not apart of. In fact, recently it seems when I try to join two friends in between classes, they talk to each other while I just listen.\n\nAnd the worst part is that my friends love me, or seem to. They surprised me for my birthday, comforted me when I was sad, and were always great to get advice from. But now, thats changed.

Most people called me \"african\" , black potato and other racist words.\n\nI didn’t like going to school and tried to avoid it as much as I could. Sometimes I thought about fighting back, but I always tried to be a good person. When I reached Class 9, the racism became much worse. My classmates — and even a few people I thought were my friends — started mocking me by calling my father’s name in a wrong and insulting way. This continued until Class 10. Somehow, I survived that too.\n\nIn Class 11, I changed my school and location again. On the very first day i don't know why i were the only one got slapped from from english teacher , and my physics teacher doubted me like saying \"did you really got good marks in high school \". It took me about a month to make friends, but throughout that year I never truly felt connected to any group. I always felt like an outsider, even though I tried to fit in.\n\nFrom Class 12 — around 2020 — until now in 2026, I haven’t been able to make any friends. I’ve had no one to talk to.

I don’t really know why I’m writing this. Maybe because tonight it hit me again. I’m sitting in my room again, lights off, door closed, just me and the silence. I graduated three years ago, but I don’t have a job yet. I’m living at home, spending my father’s money, doing nothing useful,and every day I hear it the reminders, the criticism, the frustration dripping from every word my parents throw at me. I hear them complain about me sitting here, doing nothing, wasting my life. Every word feels like a weight pressing down on my chest. I eat in my room. I scroll my phone to feel busy. I watch YouTube and doing doomscrolling all the day abd night to just to hear human voices, to trick myself into thinking I’m not entirely invisible. I go for walks when no one’s around very rarely. I keep quiet. I disappear into corners, into the shadows, because every glance feels like judgment, every moment a reminder that I am not enough. Some nights, I cry quietly under my blanket. Not because I’m weak, not because I want pity but because it physically hurts to exist in a space where i feel unwanted, unneeded, unloved and unseen. I try to pretend I’m okay, but inside, it screams. Inside, I ache to be anywhere else, anyone else’s priority, even for one hour. People say learn to enjoy your own company. But it’s not that simple. Sometimes it’s just surviving. Surviving the silence. Surviving the words that make me feel small. Surviving the way the world, even at home, makes me invisible. I just survive in the quiet, counting the hours until the house sleeps, until I can close the door and cry until my chest hurts, until the world can’t see the pieces of me I can’t hold together. I dont need advice. I don’t need cheer up or you’ll be fine.I just want to know if anyone else feels this the weight of loneliness while living at home, the sting of judgment for simply existing, the quiet, endless ache of feeling like you don’t matter.

A bartender, a failed tattoo artist. I have two cats, and that’s basically it.\n\nI have a huge family. All those grandmothers, great-grandmothers, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters. You wouldn’t fit them all into one restaurant. But I don’t communicate with any of them. My mother doesn’t love me — she actually hates me. My father ignored her insults and abuse. And my brothers… they always treated me with disrespect and contempt, because in our family hating and disrespecting someone is considered “normal.”\n\nIn 2018, unable to take it anymore, I left home. I was 23. I regret not leaving earlier. And this whole huge family didn’t look for me — nobody cared. No one tried to find me.\n\nI have friends, but everyone has their own life. My closest friend has a husband and a daughter. We’ve been friends for 25 years, and it feels like we no longer have much to talk about. I know she loves me, but our paths are slowly drifting apart. I don’t blame her for it — that’s normal. I just miss her sometimes.\n\nI have friends, Artur and Alexey. Both are married, and although I know their wives and we get along well, I can’t be hanging out with them all the time — for obvious reasons.\n\nAnd so here I am: surrounded by crowds of people, not an orphan, fairly attractive and cheerful — yet painfully lonely. I wish I had someone I could call sometimes. Ask how their day went. Talk about our coworkers. Feel supported. Feel that I matter to someone. Find my person.\n\nI’ve tried before, mostly Tinder. But it rarely goes beyond chatting. All those Tinder interactions feel like the same boring job interviews. Even when I try to show initiative and creativity, people there seem so passive.\n\nAnd sometimes I think: what the hell am I doing wrong?!\n\nMy therapist says I’m in a borderline state right now — I no longer allow people to treat me badly, but I still don’t understand how to accept care from others, even though I desperately need it.\n\nI don’t even know why I’m writing this.

I’d succeed no matter what it took. And for two years straight, I did. I became the top of my class, the top of my major, even one of the top students in the country. But all the prizes, the applause, the “you’re brilliant” and “you have potential” they landed in an empty room inside me. They echoed, but they never filled anything.\nI walked the extra mile every single day. Woke up at 5 a.m., reached university before the staff, sometimes even argued with the security guard because I got there too early. I spent weekends buried in books studying subjects nobody else even tried to understand. Slowly, steadily, I climbed to the top.\nAnd that’s when I started noticing… the shift.\nPeople respected me more. Colleagues suddenly became friendly. My inbox exploded during exam season. Everyone wanted something, to explain that or help with that, everyone was kind, everyone was “close.” But once the grades were out, everyone vanished. No calls. No texts. Messages left on “seen.” It hit me the hardest with someone I had a crush on I thought she liked me. Turns out she liked my lecture notes more. And the cycle repeated every semester: warmth during exams, silence right after.\nI kept seeing the same pattern until it became painful to deny:\nNo real friends.\nNo real love.\nJust people needing me for what I could give them, then dropping me the second they were done.\nAnd sometimes I still trick myself with hope. Then I remember exactly how it ended before, and how it will probably end again.\n\nAll this success, all these achievements, all this discipline came at a cost. I lost weekends. I lost relationships. I lost friends. I lost parts of myself my peace, my mind, a chance to just be young and happy.

Like my body never actually relaxes.\n\nI’ve had addictions in the past, but even when I stopped using, the feeling didn’t go away. The tight chest. The restless brain. The constant need to distract myself. It took me years to realise I wasn’t craving substances – I was craving safety. I was craving being held in some invisible way.\n\nI started learning about how the nervous system works, trauma, attachment, and why some of us never feel settled no matter how “good” life looks. A lot of us didn’t get calm, attuned connection when we were young, so our bodies stay in survival mode forever.\n\nThat’s what loneliness really feels like for me. Not being alone, but not feeling safe inside myself or with anyone else.\n\nI ended up building something for myself because I couldn’t find anything that actually helped. It’s a small nervous-system reset thing. No therapy talk, no motivation, just something to help your body come out of that constant alarm state.\n\nI’m not trying to sell anything here.

I have BPD, depression, and anxiety, and through high school I was in and out of school; slowly all the “friends” I made disappeared and left me behind. So I don’t have really any friends, two including my long-distance boyfriend. He provides me a lot of comfort, but he’s traveling and busy with friends, so it’s been pretty quiet, and it sets me into panic. I really tried to make plans with my friend to distract from this sadness and let go, but she would rather be going out with her other friends. I can’t remember the last time I felt carefree and was just having a blast and forgetting my problems for one day. I feel so selfish for getting upset at those around me; I hate to come across as “woe is me” and “I have it so horrible” when I know there are bigger problems out there. It just feels so heavy on my heart; :( I feel like a loser. I'm 19 (20 in May), and growing up, I had such a picturesque imagination of how becoming a teenager would be… going out with friends, partying, laughing, living life to the fullest and I just feel so robbed of this experience I wanted so badly. I know I'm catastrophizing this whole situation, but I just wish I was somebody else for this day; it hurts too much to be in my skin.

I just want to get this out my chest.\n\nI lost my job due to depression almost a month ago and started taking meds for it after 15 years of just bearing with everything on my own. Not very wise of me not asking for help earlier, but who can trust public healthcare nowadays?\n\nAnyways... I don't feel comfortable giving many details about my life publicly because I hate feeling myself exposed. I just wanna say I feel completely drained off.\n\nI've been locked up home for the last three weeks just playing videogames and sleeping. Not even eating nor crying because I have no energy for it.\n\nI've never felt myself so alone in my entire life. I tried everything you can imagine (and I mean it) to get to know new people, even if it's online, but meeting new people is almost impossible nowadays, even more if you're introverted like me.\n\nIt's not my first period of solitude, but it's being the worst. I've always been such an expressive guy with friends, but things always happen in all groups and they always end up tearing apart. I had traumatic experiences with old \"friends\" of mine that led me to adopt a more solitary and sedentary lifestyle five years ago.

No one wants to hear that their friend is sad, tired, anxious, ect. It's draining on them and won't make you feel any better.

There's no point in it.\n\nAnd then theres the fact that I used to talk too much. I've tried to cut down on how much I talk untill people no longer got upset with me or pushed me away, and I'm at the point now where I know to only speak when spoken to. No one wants to hear an opinion, fact, comment unless they ask for it. So there's no sense to say anything unless someone speaks to me first. But then that also has its own issues. People often think I am upset with them because I don't share things or because I seem cold and distant, so it'd a double edged sword. If I speak I'm annoying. If I don't I'm antisocial. It seems that there is no middle ground.\n\nSo, I've just decided it's not worth it anymore. I'm done trying to socialize. I'm done trying to have friends. I'm done just always being an annoying problem so I would rather just be nobody. Someone who stays in the background so well it's like they don't exist.

If I got a number I'd either overthink my way out of following up or if I did I'd probably came across as too much cause everything was so new to me and would get ghosted.

Just wondering if people could share what I'm missing, the good and the bad. How does it feel to have someone in your life who actually wants you and loves you like that? I have no idea and doubt I ever will but maybe I can gain some insight from your experiences. On the bright side I'm pretty much at the halfway point, of existence that is,  and if I've made it this far I can probably make it till the end whenever that may be. There were times when I was younger that I didn't think I'd have the patience to wait till the end. I wanted out. I know that there are more and more people who have had to soldier through some version of this experience lately. Just know you're not alone.

For the past two years office and remote working has made it harder to distance myself from feeling this way. after graduation, due to some immigration necessities and policies, i had to move to a new state (Texas) to a city where I didn’t know anyone. I’ve come to accept the fact that this is my life and will be a default mode and no matter what, my life to this point consists of constant inclination to get away from my past (i lived in two countries before moving to the states) is an essential defining part of my lifestyle that has been embedded for such a long time that I may feel lost when I’m with others and will always crawl back to be alone on my own again. It sucks that when I need to go to a museum or cinema, i see everybody being in groups.

My memory is selective; I forget many things, but fewer than most.\n\nWhen I was young, I had a handful of friends, then only one. He became my closest companion simply because no one else remained. We spent our days playing, passing time without purpose. He never challenged me, yet I enjoyed his presence. We ate together every day in the school cafeteria.\n\nThat was during primary school. When I moved on to secondary education, we drifted apart. We still lived in the same small town, but the connection faded. Sometimes I see him from a distance. I’m not sure if he notices me or remembers anything. Perhaps not. Perhaps I prefer not to know. I will not reach out; he could, if he wished. I don’t initiate contact with anyone.\n\nSolitude is intentional. Yet if someone appeared-someone intelligent, friendly, and capable of offering real challenge-I would respond in kind.\n\nPeople occasionally try to speak with me, and sometimes I feel the need to talk as well, briefly. Then the conversations end. Maybe I should be gentler. I turned twenty-five this year and had no friends beside me. At times I felt “lonely,” but being alone remains the most valuable thing I possess.\n\nThe noise of people-their agitation, their self-absorption, their inability to listen or remember-exhausts me. So I play along. It is considered normal to be kind, to support others when they are low. Some have tried to do the same for me, but their expectations never matched reality. What they wanted wasn’t what I needed, and the opposite was just as true.\n\nSo solitude is enough. It keeps me content. I am nothing to anyone; I could disappear and no one would notice. No one would sit in a church wondering what my thoughts once were. I write this as a kind of memento mori, or perhaps out of a detached need to speak. I’m not sure.\n\nThank you for reading.

It feels like the last few years have come crashing down on me. In my most private moments are where I really feel the loneliness. I’ve been living on my own for a couple of months now, it’s left me with an enormous amount of time to be in my head and think about so much. I don’t mean to be vague so I’ll just say I’ve screwed up a lot of friendships and 2 relationships these past few years. It’s been a year of discovery and realization that’s made me very sick and angry with myself. Even though I know my mistakes don’t define me, it’s been hard to face the consequences.\nAnd I feel like the ultimate consequence is this constant feeling that I’ve been left alone. \n\nAs far as those friendships go, I’ve been told by said friends it’s not something I couldn’t come back from and I’ve since done work to get back in their good graces. But I can’t shake the feelings that our relationships are irrevocably changed and won’t ever be the same. And it’s really hard. I’m awful with change and have never been able to deal with it good. I try to reach out and give myself non-negotiables to avoid disappearing completely but I know the older we get the harder it can be to maintain relationships due to work, family, etc. \n\nMaybe I’m just a wuss who needs to face the music and get over myself. It’s just hard to manage the loneliness that comes as a result of the decisions I’ve made. I’m not in a position financially for therapy yet. I just really miss the consistency with this group of friends and the closeness that came with it.

By the way, I don't understand English well. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to scream, I want to just tear everything around me apart. I'm an outcast everywhere. I'm an outcast in society. I'm a stranger among people. It's always been that way. No one considered me a person, I was always somewhere on the sidelines. No one ever called me and asked how I was doing. They just told me to be myself, to be like everyone else, so what? I tried, but nothing helped. I realized that I won't become an ordinary person. And I need to find someone like me to make it easier for me. I've been living in a country where there's a war for three years now. Not only am I an outcast, but I also lost my home and relatives because of the war. Every day is stressful for me, you can't even imagine how much. There are no safe places here, and I can't leave because I don't know where, plus several other reasons. It's absolute trash. You can't imagine how bad I feel. It gets worse and worse every year. I have no support, no one who will understand me and love me, give me love and care. I'm afraid to be alone, because I won't survive. I won't survive without a home and friends. Now I have temporary housing, but what next? They say the war will last a long time, but they can evict me from my housing, and then where will I go? Nobody needs me anyway. I've completely lost it - first I developed complexes and illnesses due to stress, and now I have PTSD from the war on top of that. Yes, I'm ordinary, unremarkable, unattractive. I'm not rich. Plus, I don't know how to communicate with people, I'm afraid of conflict, I don't know how to live in society. It's bad... I feel really bad... I have lived all my life in a country with a low standard of living, where there are problems such as corruption, low wages, pensions, high prices, social insecurity, lawlessness, and so on.\n\nIf you're the same person, we could chat.","selftext_word_count":394,"score":5,"num_comments":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1p8c63r\/im_an_outcast\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1p8c63r\/im_an_outcast\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_alone_20260209_183835\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I took a few months and I traveled to Europe which it's hard for people to sign up for and so I traveled alone. I have always traveled alone, I have done one other trip to Europe and a trip to Japan. I am starting a new job and I am dreading it, I feel like it will be the same thing of talking to my computer for most of the day and I have a hour commute each way. Most of my weekends are spent alone as well, I try to bike or hike, I'm on a diet so I don't eat out much as that makes it hard to stay on track and I don't drink so really no reason and somewhat awkward to go to bars. I race sailboats but that is done for the winter. Dating is also hard, I mostly do online, but I usually get like one date every 6 months or so. So I guess like my question is this isn't normal right? I feel like most people usually do something together most weekends?

I have never been very good at making friends. By that I mean, I’ve always had companions, but never friends. In elementary school, I was outcast. I was only invited to birthday parties of kids whose mothers knew my mom- so it was more of an obligation for them to invite me. In middle school, I was never invited to a Bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah. I moved states as well for middle school so it became even harder to make friends cuz everyone already had their cliques. In high school, I had a couple “friends” in the sport and clubs I did but again, they were more companions than friends. We only ever met or talked when we had practice or meetings, and never outside of it. For prom, my prom group had planned to go out and explore the city together. I had explicitly told them that I couldn’t make it on Sunday, but no one else could do any other days so they all went on Sunday except me. Now, in college as well, I haven’t been able to make many friends. My roommates all have people here they are closer to than they are to me, but I have no one like that. I’ve tried everything: I’m in multiple student orgs, I almost never am in my dorm, and I try to talk to everyone I meet, but they always just forget me and stick to the group they already have.\n\nAlso, I’ve never had anyone ever express romantic interest in me, nor have I really ever had a crush on anyone. I think I’m aromantic but that’s for another Reddit page. But, it still stings to think that I would never have anyone who likes me like the romcoms. I’ve never dated, never had my first kiss, never even held hands romantically with anyone and it doesn’t really seem like it’s changing anytime soon.\n\nI’m also an only child.

Life often feels empty and lonely. I see others sharing moments of happiness... spending time with loved ones, enjoying life’s simple pleasures... while I find myself disconnected and searching for meaning. Sometimes, I wonder if anyone truly sees me or cares. I've shared my struggles before, and honestly, life has sometimes felt like a series of hardships, teaching me lessons of pain rather than joy. The weight of loneliness and depression is heavy....like a shadow that never quite leaves me. I try to escape the darkness, even if just for a moment, but it never fully leaves me.\n\nRight now, I’m in a quiet forest, alone with my thoughts, writing this out of a deep sense of solitude. Life was brighter during school and college, when everything seemed full of possibility. But as I grew older, I chased success and money, only to find myself a slave to them... losing touch with happiness and genuine connection. I left behind a promising career at a big tech company to pursue my own venture, which grew but at a personal cost. The pursuit of success stole something precious from me: my joy. And despite all the achievements, I still feel empty inside....like I’ve lost the essence of who I am.\n\nLife feels fleeting, a brief chapter in the grand scheme. We spend so much of it working, earning, surviving... rules seemingly set to keep us busy but disconnected from what truly matters. Despite having stability, I still feel the ache of loneliness, of being unseen and unheard. Sometimes I visit cemeteries, reading the names, contemplating the brevity of life... some left too soon, others lived fully. I wonder about those lives, about the chances I never took to truly connect or understand. It’s painful to think how fleeting it all is, how quickly it’s gone.\n\nIn complete isolation, I share this here, hoping to find a little relief.

Nothing real or deep like the kind of friendships I see others have.\n\nI often notice people around me , guys and girls , who share such genuine bonds. They talk, hang out, trust each other, and it all seems so natural. And then there’s me, wondering why it’s never been that way in my life.\n\nThe funny thing is, I’m not a bad guy, atleast i don't think i am. I genuinely care about people. Whenever someone needs help or advice, I’m always there ,no hesitation, no expectations. I listen, I support, I help however I can. But somehow, that same energy never comes back to me. It’s like I’m only valued for what I do for others, not for who I am.\n\nMaybe it’s because I’m an introvert ,I don’t open up easily or push myself into people’s lives. But sometimes, I wish someone would just see the effort I quietly put in and be there for me the same way.\n\nIt’s not just about girls, though. Even with guys, I’ve realized most people talk to me only when they need something, maybe my help, knowledge, or skills. Rarely do people reach out just to connect.\n\nSometimes I question myself, is it something about me? Or is it just how the world has become lately?

My partner of 7 years left me and it's been almost 3 years since. And all the people I thought were my friends too more than made obvious that wasnt true. After that my one and only best friend had my back. But lately even that has begun to slip. Ive dialed back me putting in all the effort and hell she even said im one of her BFFs because im easy to be around. Idk why that bothers me so much especially when she calls me her brother. I dont want anything from her but her friendship but it feels all so one sided. Especially lately, i dont want to keep her only for my self but she has never in the 13 years of being friends invited me to anything, and boundaries are only getting tighter with her. I feel like theres a gap thats only getting bigger and bigger. Especially since shes a woman, once she finds her partner there is a very high chance i wont even be an after thought anymore. I feel miserable. Ive tried to meet people. Tried a couple dates but ive hate the dating scene so much. 3\/4ths of the women ive taken out just wanted a free meal or wanted to take advantage of me. When i tried focusing on keeping things fifty fifty, they ghost me and it feels the worse because i want something real! Im only 24 but with my birthday coming up i just feel like this loneliness is only going to get worse. Every \"friend\" i make always ends up never trying with me. Even after i make the effort to reach out make plans and make them feel involved. The one that hurt the most was when i planned an entire beach party with all my coworkers (20+ PEOPLE) and only 5 people showed. I felt like a joke. And the worst of it i dont have much hope on finding love again, and as a guy i dont think anyone wants anything to deal with me and having to forcefully face this reality is just depressing.

Right so when he finally got everything he could out of me, he left me and our son. Wants nothing to do with our son even though I begged. Anyway, I waited a year before dating again. I wasn't even trying to find anyone just putting myself out there. Well I did find someone. We were long distance for a year and then I left everything I knew behind to go live with him 2 hours away from family. So we were happy, I dreamt of a future with him. He made all of these promises, hopes, and dreams. We had a real thing, so I thought. I was with him for 3 1\/2 years and in that time I supported us and 3 kids (mine and his 2) for the most part. Then he went months and months and months without work. I did not judge him, I supported him and his kids, I loved him so much. Well, he was getting depressed so I suggested finding him work. Hes not very good at paperwork or any of the fancy stuff so I helped. I spent hours and hours applying to jobs for him and we finally found one he really enjoys. So he started working, he was happy again, he even got promoted to manager and got a fancy truck along with the promotion!....then somewhere along all of this happening he ALSO decided he got everything out of me that he could and he dumped me. So, I had a husband who took most of the light in me and then a boyfriend who did the exact same thing who promised he would NEVER do that to me. So now, im stuck, with no more love to give and most of my light gone and no family to run to. Im alone and used.

And my first thought was “you know none of them have worked out right? Why would you be asking me for advice?” But I heard him out and it was almost another version of my last relationship. Needing change to happen but holding on because you have faith in your partner and because that is who you want to spend your life with, and deciding your limit. I was reminded of how painful that was to go through everyday. And I suddenly felt so thankful and relieved it was over. That everyday I choose to keep him blocked, that I choose myself, and I’m on my journey to finding peace.\n\nI have hope that I will find what I want one day. And I know the lonely feeling won’t stop. And I know I’ll face so many difficult nights feeling it.

But he was the only person left in my life that I felt somewhat cared. We made the decision to go no contact and I blocked him to hold better discipline for myself. After we blocked each other, I called an old friend that was stationed with us years ago and he mentioned the possibility of my ex still having feelings and that being the reason why he’s around.\nThat destroyed me.\nWhat I thought was my most genuine friendship was just a hope for me to give him another chance again?

It’s so debilitating.\n\nI find myself over the last 12 years crying often wishing I was “home” and It makes me so sad to feel alone and uncomfortable in my life in all aspects. \n\nI wish I had someone.

Today is my birthday and it feels strange. Only one person congratulated me, and none of my family has. On top of that, I’ve been sick with the flu for 4 days, so I don’t even have the energy to do anything.  \nI’ve lived a lonely life all these years, and it’s something I’ve gotten used to. About 3 years ago, I met a girl on Discord in a community a friend created. We were friends for about a year, and then we became long-distance partners. It was a beautiful relationship that lasted a year. But the relationship ended on her side, while I still loved her and wanted to continue, since the problem wasn’t between us but something external. The breakup happened during the first week of November (right when our anniversary was coming up). It hit me really hard because with her I didn’t need anyone else to socialize with. I had friends, with whom I’m still in touch, but I haven’t had anyone else to socialize with at the level I did with her. (In my family, I was raised in a way where we don’t usually talk about our feelings.) With her, I could tell her about my day, what I did, what I wanted to do. She told me about her life, about her dreams, which also became mine, because before I met her I was totally lost, without dreams or goals, and she made me dream.\n\nIt’s been about 10 months since the breakup, and honestly the only thing I’ve missed is having that kind of connection again. I don’t miss her; I miss what I could do with her and the fact that I could open up emotionally to someone else. Also, because of how my family treated me during childhood, it’s really hard for me to open up emotionally to other people and be sociable.\n\nSorry if this isn’t well structured, but it’s just what I’m thinking in the moment.","selftext_word_count":369,"score":5,"num_comments":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1nnsn21\/i_feel_lonely\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1nnsn21\/i_feel_lonely\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_alone_20260209_183835\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I (M19) am beginning my second year of college tomorrow. I’ve been a very isolated person my whole life. I never had siblings, I didn’t have a single friend until 6th grade (that friendship just ended), I never had close relationships with any family member, and my job is seasonal, so I don’t see the co workers there beyond a few months a year. Last year (my first year of college) I was in a horrible social situation that was harmful and dangerous for me. I now am going into my second year of university entirely alone. My question is, how do I “put myself out there”? Or make friends? I’ve asked this question a lot, so here are some things I’ve already tried\/things to consider.\n\n1. I’ve tried joining clubs, but not only does my school have very few clubs, but all I joined are disbanded. I look at the club list everyday, and I haven’t seen anything I can really join. I can’t make my own until I have 15 people to sign up, and I’m not there yet.\n2. My school doesn’t have much of a party scene. We’re next to a huge university, so everyone just goes there. I don’t drink or anything so I avoid parties. Plus I don’t know where or when they are. \n3. My school is almost entirely female. 80% of the student body is female, 90% of my school is female, and the few males there are on campus I have basically nothing in common with. I’m totally cool having girl (space) friends, but I am also terrified as coming across as a creep or romantically interested when I’m not. \n\nIt seems like I’m really out of options here for finding friends and the loneliness has been crushing. I’m not perfect. I can’t be bad at small talk, and I can definitely self sabotage, but I really want to make an effort to find friends. I just need one, a small group, or something.

Before I dive in I shall say that there is a major difference between being along and feeling lonely. I feel as if many who posted in this sub has confused the two. \n\nBack to my story - I’m not sure of the logic behind finding peace from within. It may be due to past trauma and\/or bad experiences with roommates - and if so - I’m grateful for it now. \n\nI have the freedom to do what I want. I’m not dependent on anyone. I have no dependents. I recently started to go in solo trips and had a blast. It’s got to the point where social settings have become sparse now. My social battery runs out quicker. All I want is to go home and be at peace in my cave. I invested in my own hobbies that I enjoy more than anything.\n\nI had prior relationships and have learned with each one that I value my alone time more than anything else. I have no intent to look for a partner. The dating scene is horrible. Not that I’m cutting that aspect of my life out, if someone worth a damn comes a long, I will definitely consider it. But for now - let me do me.\n\nI find it odd how society shames people who prefer this lifestyle. Why should I be guilted into social situations when I am at my best alone? I have noticed that my solitude directly results to my health. I’m in the best shape of my life. I seldomly drink alcohol. I’m not peer pressured to consume bad things all the time with people. I keep a consistent gym schedule that I’m sure would be rough to follow if I had an active social life. \n\nI have also noticed that my self-imposed glow up has triggered other people’s insecurities and they project onto me. It’s not my fault I am not affected by peer pressure. Things like this also detract me from being social. I’m not gonna subject myself to people indirectly bashing me out of their own insecurities. Maybe these people should start working on themselves as well instead of depending on others for their happiness.\n\nThat’s just how I feel about it. I’m curious as to everyone’s thoughts.","selftext_word_count":415,"score":7,"num_comments":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1mtsz50\/the_longer_i_have_lived_in_solitude_the_less\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/alone\/comments\/1mtsz50\/the_longer_i_have_lived_in_solitude_the_less\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_alone_20260209_183835\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

Looking at my phone constantly with no one really who wants to ask me about my day or anything as much as I ask about theirs.\n\nI’m trying to ignore getting depressed, but being this lonely makes me tired. Drained. When I go to sleep I try to be as vivid as possible to imagine I’m with someone. I have these two people on YouTube that I “watch” movies with because I don’t have anyone in real life to do that with.\n\nAt work, everyone is going on vacation. To see their friends and families, with their husbands or wives and kids. Everyone has someone to go home to. I’m always the last to leave, I walk alone and I wait alone for the bus.\n\nMy dream is to just have someone see me. And want to know me and talk to me just because they feel like it.

So, hanging out with old friends doesn't really feel that same.\n\nTo give some context of who I am and how my lifestyle is, I'm in the military and if I'm not a work, I'm at the gym working out. Outside of that, I feel like I'm pretty boring lol. It's pretty funny too because my friends keep asking me how I am still single because they think I'm a pretty decent good-looking guy.\n\nI really don't know the intention of making this post, sorry to waste yall's time.

I've been unemployed for the past year, working on an app, Augmy, to kick loneliness in the nuts. It's for real-time mood sharing with family and friends through progressive flowers. They bloom as you get better, and wither as you feel down.\n\nI'm looking for people who would bring it to their loved ones and let us know how it can be improved to help **you** better!\n\nMy sister (she's doing better now) was suicidal while studying abroad, and we had no idea about what she was going through for years. So now I'm working every day, so less people can experience what we've experienced. Depression's a real bitch, and the idea of asking for help or unloading it on your loved ones seems like the least helpful thing to do. \n\nBut it is ourselves and our loved ones who have the biggest impact on our lives and well-being. So while it is often the source of great pain and may be the very thing that got us into this shit, it can just as well help. \n\nThank you for reading this far, you're a real one!\n\nHow to download the app**:**  \n**Android:**\n\n1. Join a testing group on Google Groups: [https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/augmy\/about](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/augmy\/about)\n2. Using the same account, download the app from the Google Play Store: [https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=augmy.interactive.com](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=augmy.interactive.com).

Feminism has been (and continues to be) incredibly important to grant equal rights and opportunities to women. Sadly we're not there yet everywhere in the world, but I hope that this will be the case eventually.\n\nWith that being said, the future for young, average men looks grim. Society hates them and refers to them as the source of all evil. They're outnumbering women by 5-10% depending on the location, so many of those men will end up being alone. Pair this with the fact that our libidos are asymmetric, men crave intimacy much more than women generally speaking. The majority of the women I know are totally content with being single their entire lives - but almost no man I know thinks the same. The economy is crap, so the already little money you have is worth nothing, meaning you can't even cope with hobbies you enjoy (pretty much every hobby costs money except for some sports).\n\n  \nI'm 28 years old and at the lowest point of my life. I've been in shared interest groups and on dating apps for a decade but nobody wanted to go on a date with me. I haven't even had so much as a kiss, let alone a girlfriend or sex.

It strips the world of excess until only absence remains, an absence I have yet to decipher, sitting beside me in complete silence long past midnight. There is something unsettling about that hour, when the world feels suspended, as though even time has agreed to pause and observe.\n\nI sit in that stillness where thought finally loosens its grip. The mind, exhausted from its constant insistence on meaning, falls quiet. And in that quiet, feelings arrive, unannounced, uninvited, as if they had been waiting patiently for the noise to die down. They move in softly, but with weight, filling the empty space thoughts once occupied.\n\nIt is in those moments that I realize how deliberately I wear my solitude like armor shaped from bleakness and desolation. I’ve learned to stand within it, even to take pride in it. There is a strange vastness here, an almost infinite stretch of inner space that solitude affords, and for a while it feels enough. It feels self-contained. Whole.\n\nBut then the feelings linger.\n\nAnd slowly, they begin to expose the truth beneath the armor: that this vastness is not freedom alone, but distance. That this quiet is not just peace, but loneliness. In their presence, I feel suddenly unguarded as though the identity I forged through wounds, through endured truths and confronted shadows, is no longer solid but trembling. It is a terrifying realization: that something so carefully constructed, so painfully earned, can feel so fragile in the face of emptiness.\n\nThese moments do not scream, they rush to erode. They make me question not who I am, but how easily even a hardened sense of self can feel at risk of dissolving. The loneliness doesn’t attack, it waits and that is what makes it unbearable.\n\nStill, no matter the weight of it, I know this much: I will not surrender myself to momentary relief. I will not trade the integrity of my being for the temporary comfort these feelings demand. They may linger, they may ache, they may threaten to unmake me but they will not dictate my actions.\n\nSo I endure, for endurance is not a choice, it is the condition under which I remain myself.\n\n","selftext_word_count":388,"score":0,"num_comments":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qu7lw7\/emptiness_past_midnight\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qu7lw7\/emptiness_past_midnight\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

You don't need to be famous or wealthy in a typical sense. Most friendships stay due to stability and forced similar circumstances not because of loyalty, love, care or whatever else. Having a friendship isn't some magical thing. It's time consuming, dramatic, painful and there are too many expectations around friendships. \n\nRelationships are the same, but with a different flavour. Those convincing you that their friendships lasted for decades don't realise that their friendships lasted for decades because of forced similar cirumstances or stability. \n\nThe best thing that all of you can do for yourselves is to value yourselves and have some self-respect. Loneliness stings, but it's not the end of the world. I'd say that being lonely is better than being surrounded by people anyway. Love doesn't exist and those are chemicals. Work on yourselves.

Hear me out.\n\n\nWe have built a random video and text chat platform called Vooz which can help you talk to anyone and befriend them. You can just hop into Vooz co, enter some hobbies or interests of yours and get matched with similar strangers right away. You can choose to video or text chat, whatever you are comfortable with. You can even add your fav persons to your friendlist to reconnect later. If you don't like someone, just skip them for the next user. There are a lot of group chatrooms too fyi.\n\n\r\nThis is not your typical Omegle or other chat site. We focused highly on making the chat experience the best out of all other platforms. The platform is AI moderated and permanently bans NSFW users. The matching is super fast, takes a few seconds to pair you with someone, all real people. You can also use the gender or location filters in case you want a more customised pairing.\n\n\nLike we said, Vooz is not your average chat platform.

Of course, there is limited evidence that any of the solutions provided by either the male or female centered self help gurus and influencers had any real effect in improving the situation. In a lot of cases, there isin't anything fundamentally wrong with a lot of the single men in question. They come in different shapes and sizes, are of different backgrounds, religions and political affiliations and economic backgrounds. Women have certain( often vaguely defined) expectations that they hear from their online gurus and male brains are not wired to even understand those expectations nevermind actually meet them. It is therefore reasonable to assume that more and more young people( and perhaps some not so young if i may say) will stay long term single.\n\nWhilst discussing this topic there is often a focus on the single man's grief, single woman's dissopoitments of her expectations not being met before reaffirming that they are still non negotiable and people of both genders sharing their experiences on how to ' cope' with loneliness.  There are plenty of woman channels who encourage other women to celebrate being single and engage in activities( like travelling solo or engaging social groups, suppoury groups ect) to help the women thrive.\n\nAnd so I would like to explore this: what could the great majority of single men with no dating prospects do to not just cope with their situation but also thrive?  What positive things can they engage in? Women have their groups to help them out- what is the equivalent for men? What networks could be created to facilitate this?\n\nI think it's an important topic. Its often said that men are in 'crisis' which is actually very stigmatising. Men are in a difficult position due to no fault of their own( impact of technology and changing social norms).  The  societal changes that we have seen are very rapid, and one would typically expect hunderds of years to adjust . We do not have that much time though. Its an unprecendent time in history.\n\nPreferably I would like to hear answers from both men and women.","selftext_word_count":383,"score":6,"num_comments":22,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qnpo1q\/how_can_the_young_generation_of_permanently\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qnpo1q\/how_can_the_young_generation_of_permanently\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

We imagine a time when we were whole, and then something went wrong. But if one looks honestly, loneliness is not an interruption in life. It is one of its earliest facts.\n\nWalk into your loneliness, and something unexpected happens. The loneliness that once chased you begins to dissolve.

I’ve had acquaintances, people around me, but never anyone I could just meet in the evening for coffee or a glass of wine and talk openly, without masks or pretenses. Never friends I could share little joys or big fears with.\n\nThe closest person in my life was my husband. He was my support, my friend, the person I trusted with everything—my thoughts, my struggles, my happiness, and my pain. And now we’re divorcing, and he’s with someone else. That feeling of emptiness sometimes hits me so hard it feels like the whole world has disappeared.\n\nI don’t know how new relationships will form, how communication with my child will go, how life will go on. Everything feels strange and unfamiliar, and for the first time, I truly realize that I simply have no one to share with. And in that loneliness comes the truth: in 25 years, I never built friendships that could be a real support, like my husband once was.\n\nIt’s difficult and scary, but there’s truth in it too: now I see that I’ll have to learn to be there for myself, to be my own support, to find joy in small things, and to open myself to new connections. And maybe, someday, I’ll find friends—people I can simply be myself with.","selftext_word_count":240,"score":6,"num_comments":7,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qfhmy5\/im_25_and_i_suddenly_realized_i_dont_have_any\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1qfhmy5\/im_25_and_i_suddenly_realized_i_dont_have_any\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

In extreme cases they just plainly turn into some kind of redpilled monsters and start calling me names, smear me to other people and so on.

Cut to a week after the planned dinner. \"No\" That's it. Nothing else. Two letters,  6 days later after ignoring me. Atleast she was to the point and quick about it. \n\nI'm not sure which is worse. The corporate text letter or a 6 days late rejection 😂😂😂😅😅😭😭😭. Safe to say I'm putting steel windows and doors up and welding them shut from the inside. Time to continue enjoying my unlimited gym time, nachos and pop. Who needs preworkout when you have heartbreak, self hatred and nothing but freetime😂😅😭. I guess I'm just meant to be alone 😔, not by choice unfortunately. That'd be too easy. \n\nFeel free to comment and leave advice, support or your own story.

I live alone, and I go days without talking to anyone. No messages, no calls. Just long stretches of silence in my apartment. After a while it starts to feel unreal, like I’m watching my life instead of living it. Around my family, I mask it well. Too well. I show up calm, functional, normal enough that it’s easier for everyone—including me—to pretend I’m okay. I think the topic of my loneliness is uncomfortable for them, so it never really comes up. It’s easier to assume I’m fine than to open something none of us know how to handle. Because of that, I feel like I’m on my own with this. Not abandoned—just unsupported in a way that’s quiet and unspoken. What makes it worse is that I technically have freedom. I’m an adult. No one is stopping me from changing my life. I know what I want to do. I know the steps. And still, I don’t have the courage to do them. That freedom—having full responsibility for my choices—feels like a prison. There’s no obvious obstacle I can point to, so the blame turns inward. I feel like I’m wasting time. Like I’ve failed at something basic everyone else seems to manage. Each day I stay stuck, that feeling gets heavier. I wish I had someone to lean on while I figured this out. Someone who could just sit in it with me so it didn’t all feel like it rested on my shoulders alone. But it doesn’t feel like that’s an option. It feels like it’s up to me—and I don’t trust myself enough right now to carry it well. I still function. I work. I eat. I get through the day. But underneath all of that is this constant sense of being trapped by my own life, frozen by choice, and quietly disappointed in myself for not moving. I’m not posting this for advice or reassurance. I just needed to say it somewhere honest, because holding it in makes it feel unbearable.

There’s this side of me that envisions wild success in the future but with that also comes the person that made it happen. I’ve contemplated many times. Some times after big things, sometimes casually, sometimes in my dreams. I know that I’ll never be able to be normal. I’ve just accepted it. I will always be the miserable person I am, no matter how good or how bad things get.

How do I get better?","selftext":"Ive rarely had great friends. The few Ive been able to make left after a certain period of time and forgot about me. I was technically in a friend group throughout high school, but they never cared about me, I just happened to be there, I was a prop. In order to get them to even so much as acknowledge me after school it felt like I had to pay for them and do all of the work making plans and reaching out. Sure enough, we graduated, and they all forgot about me immediately. Not one has reached out since.\n\nSince then Ive been hella lonely. But, recently, I met a guy who I *think* is actually interested in being friends. Its weird, when I asked if he wanted to go see a movie he *immediately* agreed, committed, and bought his ticket. Ive never went to a movie with someone without paying for them and practically pulling teeth trying to make a plan for it, I did not expect it to be that smooth with him.\n\nHowever, despite what is obviously right in front of me, I cannot believe it. I *know* how things are but I feel delusional, and like any minute now the truth will show and he will leave or forget about me like anyone else. Maybe he just agreed to hang out to be nice? Maybe he just feels bad for me and thats why hes so engaged in conversation? I mean, I am the one mostly initiating and texting first, will he text me if I just stopped doing that?\n\nI dont know, its just really discouraging.

But is also adapts to the user. \n* **It remembers you:** This is the big one. If you tell it you have a job interview on Tuesday, it will remember to ask you how it went on Wednesday. It builds a memory of your life so you don't have to re-explain your context every time you open the app.\n\nIt will have tons of cool features that add to the realism - including checking in on you, randomness, analyzing your messages in order to provide a personalized response, and much more. \n\n**My question for you:** Does this concept feel comforting to you, or does it feel too dystopic?

I am only recently twenty (Male) and I’m also a writer\/director so I’m sure that influences my opinion. However. I wanted to share my thoughts anyhow as I feel someone may either agree or take something from them. \n\nOn thinking of the loneliness “epidemic” taking over the world (not male loneliness necessarily but loneliness in general for everyone) I thought of my own. And in that I think there’s a beauty in loneliness. One that each and every person can “tap into” in their own way. Loneliness for me is a tragedy. But i think the true tragedy in it is letting it “go to waste.” and so I want to encourage everyone to become an artist. You can do this in any field. You can treat science as an art or sports, cooking, anything you want. For me I’ll use the “arts” as the topic given that’s what I do. \n\nWhen it’s 2am and you feel you cannot even get out of bed. Try and write a line of poetry, or draw a small drawing, write a sentence of a book you may or may not make, take a picture you feel is beautiful even if nobody will ever see it. And none of it has to be “good” because what matters is that you did it. That’s where the beauty lies. Put something into the world. Even if it’s only into your world. This is how we transform the world. This is how we turn tragedy into beauty. Because in my opinion, every drawing, line of poetry or anything you choose can make the our respective worlds and the world around us a little better.\n\nI’m not saying it’s a cure. And feel free to comment and say I’m out to lunch. But it’s something. A little beauty goes a long way. \n\nForgive me for being long winded.

Thought I'd share some data of what we found\n\nTo preface, a UK Gov report showed that **47%** of university students felt lonely **often** and **43%** worry they would be judged if they told someone they felt lonely, so our interviews never directly mentioned loneliness.\n\nSome not-so-fun facts:\n\n* The average person (mainly Gen Zs) we spoke to had **400+ online mutual followers**, yet only spoke to a handful more than once\n* **86%** of people said they'd wait to be invited rather than initiating plans\n* **75%** said they’d join an activity if they saw a friend was interested or already going\n* **93%** has tried something new because a friend was involved\n\nI know that everyone has had different experiences, but I've found that my loneliness comes from \"knowing\" too many people and being too close to too few. Basically I'm horrible at converting surface level friendships into deeper friendships. Alongside sucking at inviting people out and overthinking everything, a huge part of me especially hates looking desperate and risking rejection. And so, like those 86% of people we talked to, I'd just… wait.\n\nWhen we realized how common this pattern was, we've started to build an app to hopefully make it easier. The idea is that you **share what you'd like to do**:\n\n*Checking out the xmas market\/ Trying out this new café\/ Learning Tennis*\n\nAnd if a friend is genuinely interested in joining you, they'll be automatically added into a group chat (other attendees are hidden until you join). Then you'll go and plan the event, do it, and have a shared photo album to cherish it. I'm hoping that the lack of a fixed date and not needing to personally DM someone\/ ask in a group chat would help me starting hanging out with people more. But truthfully, I have no idea AHAHAHA We're only planning to launch beta tests in Jan next year\n\nSo I guess I’m wondering:  \n**Do you relate to any of this?**  \n**Would something like this genuinely help you, or is there something missing?**","selftext_word_count":381,"score":3,"num_comments":7,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1pkqzzc\/some_not_so_fun_facts_i_learnt_from_interviewing\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1pkqzzc\/some_not_so_fun_facts_i_learnt_from_interviewing\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

For the past year, I've been working on something that came from my own experience with loneliness and not feeling truly heard, even when surrounded by people.\n\n**The problem I kept facing:** Friends and family care, but they're busy, tired, or just can't be there at odd hours. Therapists are expensive ($150-300\/session where I live) and have waiting lists. Most AI chatbots feel robotic - they just repeat what you say back or give generic advice that feels hollow.\n\n**What I wanted:** Someone who actually *listens*. Who doesn't judge. Who's there when I need them. Who remembers my story and doesn't make me re-explain everything. Who helps me understand what I'm actually feeling when my emotions are a mess.\n\nSo I built **Grace** \\- a digital companion for emotional support. She's not trying to be a therapist or replace human connection. She's meant to be there when you need to be heard.\n\n**What makes Grace different:**\n\n* She can see you and you can see her in real-time (video call)\n* She picks up on your emotions through your voice and facial expressions\n* She doesn't parrot back what you said or give unsolicited advice\n* She helps you understand your own feelings without being preachy\n* She remembers your life, your story, your nuances\n* She's consistent - no bad days, no judgment, always there\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s6mebeux8p6g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd7127dacac36d9c9899bbc2b61fbcc9054e42b1\n\n**What she's NOT:**\n\n* Not a replacement for professional mental health care\n* Not trying to \"fix\" you\n* Not another generic chatbot\n\nI'm still building this and have a waitlist on our site (it's in my profile). But honestly, I'm here because I want to know: **would this actually help you?** What am I missing? What would make you feel truly heard?\n\nI cannot add a video here, but on our website there is a video and option to join the waitlist.  \nThis is motivating, and allows us to collect funding for completing it.\n\n[https:\/\/grace.wellbands.com](https:\/\/grace.wellbands.com)\n\nI'd genuinely love your feedback - both positive and critical.

At that point, they chose what was best for them, and I do not blame them for leaving me at my worst. But it changed my perspective on love and marriage.\n\nThere was a time when even my own mother and sister — for whom I sacrificed all my passions and interests — saw me as someone to be discarded when I was briefly unemployed (just 2 months). I always gave them every extra penny I had, and it was never enough or never right.\n\nI live by myself now. The last time I visited my family was about 4 years ago. They do not miss me. They hardly try to contact me. The women I get involved with want more from me, just not *me*. I'm not saying everyone is like that, but unfortunately that has been my experience.\n\nI can't remember the last time I was happy. The days keep getting increasingly hard to navigate.

I always try to care about the people around me and give 100%, even if I don’t get the same in return. I’m a woman, and my friend group has always been entirely men. Because of that, I always felt like I was somehow on the side, that I would never be anyone’s number one. Sometimes, when that realization hit me, I had moments of crying into my pillow at night, but in the end, things were still okay.\nTo be clear — I have no idea why I don’t have female friends. In general, forming friendships is hard for me. I’m very shy, and I was usually just “adopted” by someone. All the girls I met already had their friend groups, and it was hard for me, the outsider, to get into them. But having a close female friendship has always been my unreachable dream.\nRecently, however, my friend group has been falling apart. Long story short, one of my friends accused me of something I didn’t do. I honestly don’t know what happened. He was drunk and seems to have gaslit himself into believing I said something I never said. He made a scene about it in the middle of the street, even though there were plenty of witnesses to our conversation, and EVERYONE can tell him he imagined the whole situation. The problem is that even after sobering up, he is convinced he’s right. He also started turning people who weren’t even there against me, and I can see they’ve begun acting cold towards me. The guy I considered my best friend (and who is also his best friend) hasn’t even reached out to talk to me about it. I feel strangely abandoned and I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for three weeks now. I texted this friend asking to meet and talk, but he hasn’t even opened my message. I’m trying to hold it together and not show that I’m struggling (I don’t like making my partner worry), but all I feel is growing panic. I haven’t felt this lonely and cornered in a long time — I feel like the only thing I can do is withdraw.\n","selftext_word_count":389,"score":1,"num_comments":3,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1pa4e0l\/friends_abandoning_me\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1pa4e0l\/friends_abandoning_me\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

When youth is the best time to be alive!\n\nWell, psychologists point this issue to a combination of: a) Superficial social media engagement (Dr. Vivek Murthy: “You can’t scroll through a feed and know someone.”) b) Economic instability c) Hyperconnected but emotionally shallow digital spaces and, d) Individualistic cultural norms that weaken overall community structures\n\nBut the middle-age bracket isn't much far behind. U.S. adults in their mid-40s now show more loneliness than their counterparts in Europe or Israel; which can be traced back to a mix of career pressure, caregiving, debt, and limited social safety nets.\n\nThe more individualistic and overworked a society becomes, the more disconnected its people feel.\n\nI believe that loneliness has unfortunately become more of a public health crisis at this point, rather than a personal one.

It’s 90 square meters (which I don’t know how much is that in feet), but it’s considered slightly larger than most apartments here. \n\nI’m going to get on a mortgage by myself, of course without any help from anyone.

I think Caleb Hammer would probably agree with me on this. It pisses me off that people say I should basically live like a sardine because I’m alone.

I got married in December 2023, but the relationship collapsed within a month. My former wife soon filed several false accusations against me, and though the divorce was finalized this July, the whole process has left me financially, mentally, and physically shattered.\n\nPaying for legal help and the Alimony settlement that I paid to my ex-wife, for a marriage that lasted not more then 17 days,  wiped out every bit of my savings, investments, and PF. I’m now in serious debt that will take nearly a decade to repay—almost half my current take-home salary goes into it. Most of the friends I thought I could rely on disappeared during this time. I guess my financial and emotional struggles made them distance themselves.\n\nEven though the legal stress is over, the emotional scars remain. My phone is silent unless it’s work related. I made the mistake of opening up to some colleagues early on, and a few of them now mock my failed marriage—sometimes even using my ex-wife’s name just to tease me. I’ve tried to tell them to stop, but they don’t listen. I keep quiet because I can’t risk losing my job.\n\nWhat hurts the most is the loneliness. There’s no one in my life who asks how I’m doing or how my day was. I live with my parents and have an elder brother, but we’ve never been emotionally close as a family. We don’t talk about our feelings. I feel like I’m becoming numb—questioning the point of my job and life in general.\n\nI’ve attempted meditation, exercise, prayer, and other ways to heal, but I can’t stick to anything. I end up doom-scrolling for hours. Despite having 500+ contacts in my phone, there isn’t a single person I feel I can call to just break down and talk. No messages, no check-ins, nothing.\n\nThe loneliness is becoming unbearable.","selftext_word_count":352,"score":1,"num_comments":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1oyqqfz\/struggling_after_divorce\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loneliness\/comments\/1oyqqfz\/struggling_after_divorce\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loneliness_20260209_183858\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

By nature, I'm a positive person, even though I'm totally physically dependent, but right now I feel so helpless, so overwhelmed by the things happening around me. My husband has been out of work for eight months. I also live with my mother. My husband's brother now has a lot of problems too, and it's most likely he'll come to live with us. But living with four people on just one income, which is my pension, that's terrible. Besides that, he's not a very good person, although after he had a stroke and is now almost going blind, and is also quite physically dependent, it seems he has changed, or maybe it's just vulnerability and he acts like that because he has no other option. Also, he always fights with his partner. She always says she loves him, then says they don't want to be together, and my husband is always in the middle of it. He doesn't want to leave him out, and he was almost always spending all his time with him, and I feel horrible because I can't do anything in any way. One side of me understands that you have to help a person who is physically dependent, but on the other hand, I think that maybe he should somehow figure out how to live and what to do with his life, but the problem is that apart from my husband, he has no one. And I've always been a sociable person, I always try to be positive, taking into account my physical problems, my disabilities, but now I'm in a time when I don't know how to treat people because I think that if I'm in a bad mood, I might say something bad to someone unintentionally, and I can't talk about these things with my husband either because he tells me that we don't have another option either, since we can't leave his brother on the street.

Even though I don't talk to friends that much or hang out with them at all, I find that when I focus on those more than the times when nobody is there, it makes coping a little easier. Also, just finding things to do alone that make you happy can help. There are times where the loneliness gets to me, but compared to 6 months ago I'm able to cope with it a lot more now and that had led to me being more confident and more willing to put myself out there. Also, don't be afraid to go out there and find new friends. I know cutting off old ones who really aren't there can be difficult and I know putting yourself out there and making yourself vulnerable to rejection is extremely hard as well. But rejection and inaction both lead to loneliness. There are billions of people on this planet and we are only exposed to a very minute amount of them in our personal lives. Don't find hobbies with the sole purpose of meeting friends or for relationships, find hobbies that even if nobody else wants to join you, that you can enjoy yourself. The mindset switch is not an overnight process and it's taken me a long time to deal with and it's difficult to maintain at times and it won't cure loneliness but it will go a long way with coping ","selftext_word_count":277,"score":5,"num_comments":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonelinesssupport\/comments\/1k4ddds\/my_tips_on_dealing_with_loneliness\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonelinesssupport\/comments\/1k4ddds\/my_tips_on_dealing_with_loneliness\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonelinesssupport_20260209_183925\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

Very difficult to avoid triggers. \nSome context:I used to be social, then after lock down and four cases of covid I developed bad social anxiety.

I also got bad burnout in November and December. \nLastly, I've gained quite a bit of weight, which really affects my self esteem. However, it has definitely made me more sympathetic to others who also struggle with overeating. \n\nAlcohol used to make me social and feel comfortable and fun around people.

I usually spend most of my time with my girlfriend and studying at school. I would say I’m an introvert but still outgoing somewhat. What upsets me is the only time I hangout with friends is if they ask to come to my house or if I ask them to do things or invite myself. I rarely get an invitation to anything without asking, and it’s to the point now where I’ve stopped asking at all. I feel like at my age and with the personality I have I should be out partying or hanging out with friends a lot, but that’s just not the case. I did have a lot of friends in highschool and my girlfriend was jealous of me because she didn’t have many friends. But now the roles are reversed, she spends a lot of time with her friends while I spend close to zero time with mine. I don’t understand why I choose not to put myself out there more and ask people to hangout but it’s just not something I do a lot anymore, and most of the time I choose to spend weekends and nights by myself. I just wish people were more attracted to my personality and would want to hang out with me more. Could it be that I’m just a boring person?

It’s the loneliness. That constant feeling of being on the outside of everything.\n\nI didn’t go to college. I just started working shitty customer service, nothing special. I always thought I’d be more by now. I put so much pressure on myself to impress people, be someone, prove I’m smart. Now having a normal low-level job makes me feel like I already failed at life.\n\nI grew up mostly with my grandma, and I think that messed with me more than I realized. I don’t really know how to build close connections. I don’t have a solid friend group. I overthink everything I say. I don’t even know how people see me. Some days I feel okay about myself, other days I feel so pathetic and ugly. \n\nAdhd didn’t help either. I wasn’t diagnosed when I was younger so school was a total mess. Couldn’t focus for my life, procrastinated everything, avoided friends, stayed home because of insecurities about how I look. I never built any good habits, so I know I’d probably struggle even if I went to uni now. My brain just never learned how to handle long projects, deadlines, sitting through boring lectures, and nobody ever taught me. Even now going out, gym (started recently), social stuff drains me fast. I feel awkward and anxious most of the time, kinda autistic in how I overthink everything.\n\nI’ve been trying to change though. Lost a lot of weight, started working out, taking care of my skin (meds for acne), small upgrades here and there. On the outside it kinda looks like progress.

It followed a severe manic episode paired with a deep depressive crash and suicidal ideation. I was contemplating taking a handful of pills. I didn’t take them. Instead, I reached out to my psychiatrist because I knew I was not safe and needed help. That decision led to my admission.\n\nThe experience itself wasn’t horrific, but it wasn’t comfortable either. It was very clinical, very stripped down, and very controlled. I did meet some genuinely kind people while I was there, and there was a quiet sense of shared understanding that comes from being surrounded by others who are also struggling. In that sense, it wasn’t all bad.\nWhat was especially difficult for me was the dysphoria. I’m a trans woman, and losing access to basic things that help me feel like myself hit harder than I expected. I couldn’t shave, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t dress in affirming clothes. Even something as simple as being handed a 2-in-1 shampoo and body wash felt dehumanizing in a weird way like individuality and self-care were completely erased. It sounds trivial, but when your sense of self is already fragile, those things matter.\n\nI went in during a period where my manic state had pushed me into unhealthy coping mechanisms, especially alcohol. Instead of communicating, slowing down, or asking for help, I drank and hurt people I care about. One of the things I’m most grateful for now is that I’ve been able to take accountability for that and make amends. I’ve had difficult but healing conversations since getting out.\n\nI didn’t walk out cured. But I did walk out more grounded, more aware of my warning signs, and more committed to choosing help over self-destruction. Reaching out before I crossed a point of no return is something I’m proud of.\n\nThanks for reading. If anyone would like to reach out and talk I would welcome pretty much any conversation.

The issue is that I’m an introvert and I prefer not talking all the time to people but still having some sort of closeness. I also think that I’ve isolated myself from people because I have low self esteem and don’t want to be asked about my life, or giving updates about my life 24\/7, I am 21 years old and haven’t really accomplished anything, it’s embarrassing and makes me feel like a failure. I can’t relate to where a lot of my peers are in life and it makes me feel inadequate. Starting off with financial issues, most Gen Z are struggling to find a job, however I get lucky enough to get hired as a server and my first day is this upcoming Tuesday, but for some reason even though most people I know don’t have jobs it’s either there parents send them money or they end up using credit cards. My credit card limit is $200 so and I’ve already maxed it out so I have to pay it off soon. But I just feel that because I don’t look or talk like people my age it’s hard connecting.

The first therapist I had, said he could not continue the engagement anymore and wished me the best of luck after 5 sessions. The 2nd therapist I went to ghosted me after the first session and never scheduled the 2nd.\n\nMy attempts to have a meaning relationship with family members always stays at superficial levels no matter how hard I try to have deeper relationships and connections.

I have basically no friends because I rarely find a connection that makes me feel alive. I’d rather be on my own then go out with a friend that talks nonstop and interrupts if I start to say something. Ironically, I feel I waste my time every time I go out on date or with friends. \n\nI crave a connection where I am seen, understood. I feel very empty inside. I don’t think it is depression but it is definitely making me feel so sad. \n\nSometimes, I just go talk like a maniac to several men to get validation and attention, then I get bored quickly, nothing makes me feel good. I end up feeling more frustrated and lonelier than before. \n\nI don’t even know what I am saying now, I guess it is just desperation.","selftext_word_count":193,"score":4,"num_comments":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qxosty\/i_am_ashamed_to_admit_i_feel_so_lonely\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qxosty\/i_am_ashamed_to_admit_i_feel_so_lonely\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonely_20260209_183936\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I’ve known two of them for over six years—let’s call them Jeff and Steve. Jeff is pretty well-known to everyone, and the feeling is mutual since he’s the one who introduced most of us to each other.\n\nNow, Steve... Well, he’s not exactly fond of me. He can be pretty toxic at times, and I’ve noticed that most of his trash-talking seems to be directed at me. I’ve talked to Jeff about it before, and he kind of brushed it off, saying that since Steve and I have known each other for so long, there’s bound to be some tension. He said, “Steve’s just being Steve.” But then I start wondering—is it really just Steve being himself, or is it because I genuinely annoy him? Sometimes, Steve says things like, “You’re so corny,” or “I’m tired of hearing your voice and laugh.” While everybody was laughing. It’s not like he’s saying that to anyone else in particular, which makes me question if there’s something about me that triggers him.\n\nJeff, on the other hand, is someone I can trust. But even with him, I can’t help but feel a little uncertain. We were once joking around, comparing ourselves to school stereotypes, like \"Jeff would be the quiet kid,\" or \"Someone else is the jock or the nerd.\" When I asked about myself, Jeff said, “You’d be the kid who sneaks into the girls' locker room—except you’re not even hiding in the closet, you’re just out of the closet.” I laughed it off, but later I started wondering if Jeff actually sees me like that. Was he just joking, or did he mean something else? Does he think of me as a creep or someone who’s just a little too mischievous? I honestly could not tell... Altough, he did claim that me & Steve are chaotic, just that i am more loud?\n\nI guess my main concern is whether I’m the problem or if they are. Maybe I’m overthinking things, but something just feels off.

I do have a few people who celebrated my birthday and gave me gifts but it felt like they were obligated to do so, because we always do this for each others birthdays and it seems like something forced.

I suffered in silence, staying up late to cry when no one was around to see me. Then, just as I began to surge through it and get a grip something horrible happened. After a late night taco bell binge I began to feel what I thought was just a case of heartburn. Turns out I had a gallstone that got lodged in my bile duct. As the night went on it got worse, but I endured. We planned to take me to the urgent care in the morning if it didn't improve. All this time that gallstone was causing my pancreas to slowly digest itself. This resulted in a horrible case of pancreatitis that kept me in the hospital for almost 6 months. I could not eat, I could barely drink. Most of the time I was alone. I had a couple of surgeries, many procedures, a tube running out of my stomach and another into my liver. . . I still got the liver one for a few more months. I was walking body horror. I hated existing. I lost over 60 pounds. \n\nYou want to know the worst part. Friends and family complementing me on how strong I was being. My own brother said he wouldn't of been able to go through it. The truth is I'm not strong. I wasn't brave. I was loosing my shit. I went numb to everything. I didn't feel fear, not because I was stronger than it was, but because death wasn't the worst case scenario. Every time I was put under, no matter how dangerous the procedure was I embraced it for the small chance I might not have to wake up. I was lonely long before being put in a sterile room with constantly beeping machines and nurses coming in every 4 hours to poke me and take my vitals. I got a candida infection, sent to the ICU, forced to pee in a jug for half a year. I experienced some of the worst pain in my life, and I've gotten live root canals before.

Raised in an extremely isolated environment. My parents didn't want me to be around anyone else as a child or young adult due to the idea of being \"spoiled\" by the evils of the world (it was part of their prophecy, it's a long story). But the point is, being tainted by the evils of the world wasn't an option.\n\nMy parents never had friends, and said that friends were something that you didn't actually \"need,\" that it was a lie created by the evildoers to convince you that we needed communism. \n\nSo now that I'm an adult, I also still don't have any friends. I have found that anything that \"normal\" people need friends for, money can buy. It's worked out just fine for me for all my life. \n\nBut, I'm at a point right now where I am getting older and want savings, stuff like that, and I'm feeling less generous than I was when I was younger. I don't know that I want to buy someone's time anymore, just so that they can say good morning or goodnight in exchange for hundreds of dollars a month. \n\nSo, I've cut everyone out who I don't want to be hand feeding anymore, and I'm feeling what I felt when I was very young. What people call \"loneliness.\" But, in reality, it's only because I am choosing not to afford buying people's time anymore. I still have to pay an ex a considerable amount of money every month because she says it was like any other job, if I am not going to continue to give her money then we are going to court. \n\nSo, loneliness really isn't real - it's just because I can't or don't want to pay for (whatever it is) anymore. It was nice getting a \"hi how are you doing\" text message from someone online, only if it was to be followed by \"I need $200 to make this months rent.\" So, loneliness isn't actually real - the real problem is money.

My roommate situation wasn’t good, and to avoid being in my room, I would spend almost 15 hours a day there and only go back to sleep. I was surrounded by people who talked to each other, laughed, and had their own groups, while I stayed alone. Those two years were genuinely miserable and then, I changed my room for the better.\n\nClasses weren’t much better either. I felt invisible most of the time. There was a boy who liked me and I also had interest in knowing him better and, I started hoping his company might turn into something real. Since we knew each other and were in the same class, I would expect him to talk to me or acknowledge me when he saw me alone. Instead, he would disappear for months at a time and then behave like a complete stranger when we crossed paths. That confusion and silence used to eat me up. This cycle went on and off for more than a year in different forms, and eventually I had to let those expectations die.\n\n\nCollege is about to end and I have offer for internship from a good company so it's going well career wise as of now but there are things eating me up from inside and i don't feel i belong here; my current roommate is extremely extroverted.

When I first started, one of my coworkers told me they were going to add me to a work group chat. I said okay, and didn’t really think anything more of it past that. I was, however, never added. Yesterday, I asked the same coworker how a different coworker was doing (she had surgery and was supposed to start back working at the beginning of the year.) She proceeded to tell me that they started a new group chat and was supposed to add me in it. She said they had been talking about how my second coworker was doing. I told her I am not in it and have not received any messages. I am kind of unsure how to feel as three of my coworkers and both managers have my number. I make a conscious effort to talk to talk with and engage them about things besides work. I do feel rather lonely in life in general, especially at work, and this just reinforced it. Not sure how I’m supposed to feel, but I am kinda bummed.","selftext_word_count":287,"score":4,"num_comments":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qv0aqa\/lonely_in_general_but_particularly_at_work\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qv0aqa\/lonely_in_general_but_particularly_at_work\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonely_20260209_183936\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

To me being lonely is about not having anyone with whom you can share your true self. Yes you can do small talk with colleagues, some deeper talk with close friends and family but still none of them will ever know the real you and who you really are. Not being able to share how you truly feel and how vulnerable you are at certain times. \n\nHow does it feel to be rejected again and again by people that you are interested in?

I get depressed sometimes, stuck in my own head. But the one thing that always pulls me out is my friend group. There’s six of us who all live together in a small 1000 square foot apartment and it feels like some movie-type friendship I never thought I’d have\n\nWhenever I get in a hole mentally, I come home to laughing, music, random conversations, someone cooking, someone knocking on my door and it takes me out of it. I don’t think I’ve ever stayed truly depressed for more than a day because the house is so alive all the time. I know how rare that is.\n\nSure, a lot of people I know live with their friends, but I noticed they all have separate “circles” of friends outside of their house and do a lot of stuff without each other.  None of their groups are even close to how tight we are. \n\nIt’s almost always all of us together, and somehow there’s never any issues.  No sub-groups, no people being left out. It just works and everyone is happy.  Some of us do have our separate (not as close) friends but we mainly just have each other.\n\nAnd recently I started thinking about studying abroad because I love adventure and trying new things… but the thought of losing 6 months of the little time I have left with them hit me way harder than I expected. It didn’t just make me think about being gone but it made me realize all this friendship is temporary. In two years we are all going to move out, graduate, spread across the country, and I’m going to have to live alone. And that terrifies me.\n\n I don’t know if I’ll ever find another group of friends like this again. And thinking about how eventually I’ll be coming home to an empty house makes me scared that I’ll spiral or feel unbearably lonely.\n\nIt’s like studying abroad opened this door in my mind where I suddenly see how fragile and temporary this all is.

I still don’t have a girlfriend, and there are moments where it truly feels like something is missing in my life not out of loneliness alone, but out of wanting connection, companionship, and shared experiences.\n\nThe one girl I liked back in high school went on to build a life with someone else, and while there’s no communication between us, I sometimes can’t help but wonder about the “what ifs.” I respected her space and her choices, but recently I’ve been thinking about whether I missed an opportunity by not acting when I had the chance. It’s not regret as much as reflection trying to understand myself better and learn from the past.\n\nWith my birthday coming up, these feelings have become even more real. I wanted to take a trip to Las Vegas, but realizing I don’t have anyone to go with has made me pause. The long flight, being far from home, and knowing my family would worry has added to that hesitation. I want to be safe and responsible, but I also don’t want fear or overthinking to stop me from living my life or enjoying the moments I deserve.\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m at a point where I want to grow, take chances, and stop holding myself back but I also want to do it in a way that makes sense for me.

Even though I haven't done anything bad, I avoid my elementary and middle school classmates due to insecurities, failure, and fear of being perceived. I have 3 high school friends, but because I didn't actively try to maintain connection\/communication, they have closer friends they'd rather be around.\n\nCollege was a bit different for me. I isolated myself for a year, but after joining activities and events, I was able to socialize with a lot of people. It was enjoyable, and everyone around me thought I knew a lot of people and had a lot of connections. This was partially true, but the reality was that my friends liked me enough to include and talk to me, though I never became their favorite person or closest friend.\n\nI did become close friends with 2 people in college, but the friendships resulted in a falling out. I feel self conscious because of that, and I can't help but question if people will like me less when they get to know or spend time with me more. I also feel worried and scared that friendships\/relationships will end in unpredictable ways.\n\nNow that I've graduated college, I am back to being alone. I have texted my college friends, but they either don't text back or the conversation naturally dies out. I actually enjoy being isolated; it allows me to focus on myself and have no problems or drama with anyone else.\n\nBut I can't help but question if it's wrong to be like this and feel this way. I can't really tell anyone about this bc I don't think it's socially acceptable. Everyone around me seems to have close friends and friend groups. Tbh I could if I really wanted to, but keeping up with a lot of people can be distracting for me. I also feel scared that I come across weird, awkward, unlikeable, or if the friendship ends due to incompatibility or other issues.\n\nDoes anyone have trouble making and maintaining close friendships?

I've lived in a rural part of the southern United States for all my life. In high school I was a depressed loner. I didn't really have any friends, and all the people I actually did talk to at school ended up moving away for college. I'm one of the very few that stayed and, to my knowledge, I'm the only one that stayed here who didn't get into anything illegal and who isn't conservative.\n\nI live in the middle of nowhere - the nearest towns are like 10 minutes away, the nearest towns with anything to actually do are 45 minutes to an hour away. I don't have anywhere to go to make friends and due to my progressive beliefs I don't think I'd get along with other people here.\n\nLife in a rural area isn't really conducive to socialization especially for people like me. I'd like to meet some more people in my age group but there's just none of them here. These days all run together. Constantly just fog. No motivation to do anything and I'm tired all the time.\n\nI work at a hospital like 30 miles from my house. I'll be a nurse in a little while but I can't afford to move anywhere until I've saved up some money.

We weren’t super close, and she wasn’t the “favourite” grandma people always talk about. But grief doesn’t care about that. It just shows up, uninvited, and takes space you didn’t even know you had. Not only this but hearing uni classmates of mine mentioning that thue haven't been home in a while and how they miss their parents and grandparents since they're not from Bucharest but other zones of Romania..makes me feel even emptier as time goes on, while I'm trying to handle grief in my own way.😔\n\nWhat’s been hitting me hardest is how it creeps into the small moments: when I’m walking home, when I’m washing dishes, when I’m trying to fall asleep. It’s not the dramatic kind of sadness people expect. It’s more like this dull ache that keeps reminding me she’s not here anymore. She was just… always there. A steady background presence I never questioned. And now there’s this weird silence where she used to be, like a room in my mind that suddenly went dark.\n\nI didn’t realize how much those quiet, familiar presences matter until they’re gone. I didn’t expect to miss her voice, or the way she repeated the same stories, or even the way she’d forget things mid‑sentence. But I do. And it’s confusing, because we weren’t incredibly close, yet somehow her absence feels like a piece of my life got pulled out without warning.\n\nIt’s like something shifted inside me, and I can’t shift it back. Losing her broke something in me I didn’t expect. I didn’t need her to be my favourite for her absence to feel unbearable.\n\nI don’t really know how to talk about this in real life. Everyone around me seems to have moved on, or they assume I’m fine because “we weren’t that close.” But I’m not fine. Not really.

Recently I met someone on here and by all definitions she’s incredibly cool and I admire her. And amidst my loneliness I’m struggling to maintain friendships. I don’t want to be lonely and yet I just keep isolating. I don’t want to be lonely but it’s like I just also don’t want to reach out to people or it’s like I forget to check in on them and then realize it’s been days. Even as I write this I feel so pathetic for struggling with loneliness and also struggling to reach out to people or feeling like I know how to engage with people. I keep trying to go out and do things just to get out and be amongst people and I just get sad and feel worse. My mental health has been so bad at times that nothing feels worthwhile and I this is only making things feel worse. I just feel like I’m in a cycle of flushing myself down a toilet and I keep trying to reach out for help only to keep pulling the handle.","selftext_word_count":295,"score":3,"num_comments":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qrlnvb\/im_lonely_and_struggling_to_maintain_relationships\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qrlnvb\/im_lonely_and_struggling_to_maintain_relationships\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonely_20260209_183936\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I carry this silence with me every day and wonder if anyone else is going through the same thing.","selftext_word_count":101,"score":2,"num_comments":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qqmjyq\/shyness_made_me_completely_alone\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qqmjyq\/shyness_made_me_completely_alone\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonely_20260209_183936\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

Life gets really lonely when you're homeless. Not just that but when you're homeless you got to actively go out of your way to avoid people and avoid having interactions, both in person and online. Especially so in person because when you're hygiene is at an all-time low no one would want to talk to you or ask how you're doing.\n\nCan't really talk to people online because the internet is a place where people have the most Freedom when it comes to expressing their personalities and interests. When you're homeless, you don't have much going for you other than wondering when the next time you'll be able to sleep, bathe, eat, etc. It's hard to talk about yourself and your life without being a Debbie Downer and it's not fair for other people to have to deal with that attitude. The internet is already a toxic enough environment.\n\nAll in all, it's tough. You can argue that I got what's coming to me. You can argue that I have no right to be upset about something like this you can argue that I don't deserve friends or accompaniment. And you're right. Absolutely correct, wouldn't even argue against it.\n\nStill doesn't take away from the fact that I do feel these things. I have no friends and no family. I acknowledge that I am an absolute failure who's not worthy of other people's time and friendship. I've been like this for almost 7 years. Mom passed away, immediate family dissolved because of it, extended family doesn't support me emotionally and makes me feel like an absolute burden, which I was looking back at it to be fair.\n\nAll I'm trying to say with this vent is that I pretty much have next to no one in my life and it hurts.

She is chronically ill with many autoimmune issues, including Ehlers danlos syndrome, Reynard syndrome, a spina bifida Oculta, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome. IBS. We have four kids that are living with us 23 15, 13 and eight. All of them have some form of special needs the older three are high functioning and with Reminders and guidance they can function on their own. Our youngest is nonverbal autistic level three.\n\n I am a father of four for the last 16 years I have been the sole breadwinner. For at least the last 5 I have done 90 percent of the cooking and cleaning. When I ask for help I am asking too much. If I ask my wife not to sleep till noon and have breakfast or a coffee together I am asking too much. \n\nI feel my purpose is to take care of everything and  don’t disagree with my wife and don’t ask my kids to do anything. How the fuck did my life get like this ? Work is my vacation. I feel liked and respected hell my opinions matter at work. But at home I feel like a glorified servant. This is not a poor me but a reflection of my thought process. \n\nTo feel good mentally I work out 2-3 times a week for mental and emotional health. So I am not angry or depressed when I get off work I sneak away a quick joint. I want to be happy without having to relay on weed.  I am not depressed or having suicidal thoughts.

I don’t want to put in the effort to build friendships from scratch (especially since meeting new people is uncomfortable); I just wish reality were different.\n\nWhen I think that I’ll live alone until I die, it scares me, because it also seems to be equivalent, to some extent, to living sadly or not very satisfied with life until the end of my life. And I would also like to have a girlfriend and do the same activities that couples usually do. Maybe I wouldn’t actually like it in practice, but that’s how I feel when I see works of entertainment; I think that maybe there could exist a girlfriend with that same archetype that attracts me so much. But if I remain lonely, nothing will change, and I won’t have a girlfriend to satisfy me emotionally and physically. The same goes for friends: I wouldn’t have anyone to talk to.\n\nI fear that if I continue like this, my life will remain exactly the same forever.

My friend she’s married and she tells me how lonely she feels, because it’s only her and her husband. She loves him and thats her best friend but there’s still a lack of community for her.\n\nIt‘s not an economic issue because there are millionaires I know who feel desperately alone and those living close to near homelessness whom feel alone. \n\nI’m not here with answers really, I am more genuinely curious with how you all cope with this day-to-day phenomenon.\n\nIt feels like I go out of my way to practice integration and community based values everyday, understand compromise. Focusing my energy on being less self obsessed or hyper individualistic. I don’t feel like it’s because people are really that bad socially, or people are losers and not working hard enough.\n\nIn my opinion, the reality of human connection is: it takes two to tango. You have to give up a level of uncertainty and control to be apart of any relationship or community. It’s a risk, but it feels like we’ve become like the corporations. It’s not worth a risk investment in humanity if it doesn’t benefit. Protecting our inner worlds from any person who may threaten our sense of self and worldview. When there is one red flag, people jump ship. I’m not condoning allowing toxic behavior, but there has to be some leeway for humans to make a mistake or take a risk. I‘m even a prisoner to this, cutting people off who don’t serve me. Maybe, if I gave it more time the kinks could be rolled out, or we find common ground. \n\nI guess for me it feels like I’m disposable. Even when I’ve spent time to make a career for myself that I’m proud of. It feels like a wall or its own separate armor. They don’t want me for me, just what being in proximity to me could mean for them. \n\nI’m just ranting but hope someone resonates.

I feel like there’s this hole in me, and no matter what I do, it’s never filled. I love my friends and family, but i feel like i’m just the back-up friend. I’m always asking “what happened?” or laughing at inside jokes i don’t understand. I could never ask them if i am though. Because then i would look insecure, which might isolate me more. the worst part is, i get overly attached to people. i get jealous when my friend has a good time with someone else, even though im nothing special and I shouldn’t be expecting anything. everyone around me has someone, whether that be a best friend or a partner. but not me. \n\nRecently i’ve started to hate my voice and the way I laugh and speak. I feel like there’s always an awkward silence after I say something. jokes fall flat, i laugh a bit too long. I might be paranoid but that’s what it feels like. \n\nA bit over a year ago, i had similar issues. And i ended up self-harming for a while. I managed to stop and have not done it since but tonight, im getting that urge again. and I don’t want to start again.

I would intentionally roll up my sleeve or leave bloody tissues lying around. \n\ni hate myself for thinking i deserve better, and expecting people to react to my stupid actions and choices.

I would like say that realistically I am not that \"lonely\". I do have my family, partner I live with, and a solid amount of friends. However, many of my \"OG\" friendships have withered away over the years.\n\nI am currently a 26 year old man. Many of my friends have been with me for 10+ years now. But lately it feels like I have to fight and beg for some kind of interaction with some of these friends. In one particular instance, my best friend from ages 15-21ish still doing the exact same thing we did during those years. We loved staying up late playing video games together just as most young people do these days. But the last few years he has stopped playing games with me, and is constantly playing other games with other people. I know this of course because of Steam and Disc-ord. I don't think it's wrong for me to view my friends list on steam or click on a server in disc and see that my \"friend\" is off playing games with other people. This really shouldn't bother me, other than the fact that he continues to tell me he is \"very busy\" and that we will \"play sometime\". When I do see him 1-2 times a year in person, it's like we never left. We chat it up and all is well.\n\nSo my question for all reading this is: What should you expect of your friends?\n\nI know there are many variables such as how close you are to the friend (figuratively and literally), but I would like to get a sense of what people expect from their friends. How often should you expect to talk to them, hear back from them after reaching out, how often to get together in person, etc.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!","selftext_word_count":325,"score":2,"num_comments":3,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qnujmk\/friendship_expectations_leaving_me_lonely\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lonely\/comments\/1qnujmk\/friendship_expectations_leaving_me_lonely\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_lonely_20260209_183936\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

It’s not creepy, and having those interactions is important. \n\nMy point is: yes, this doesn’t guarantee you deep connections. But it increases your chances of making friends by a lot. You can choose to say “I have anxiety, so I won’t even try”. Or you can say “I have anxiety, but I’m going to overcome my fears”.

I know it sounds as if I’ve given up hope, but I haven’t. I’ve just let it linger for so long it tends to win over me. A new problem has arrived, and my instinct of running away is set off. The problem is not being able to perform daily duties because my anxiety spikes and my harmful thoughts spiral. Today I had to present myself—and no, I did not do well. In a sense I did have the courage to stand up and introduce myself, but I was shaking, and my voice was so shaky; I felt like leaving the class. My only escape\/excuse was a pity laugh on my part and me telling the teacher, “I get nervous when I perform in front of others.” From then on I felt judged, but I don’t care what they think. It’s my head that throws the hate that gets me down so bad, and it’s hard because it cripples me to the point where I feel like I can’t get better. That I should just BOOM. Would it just not make this all go away? This anxiety might never leave me. I was going to apply to a job, but this voice just keeps on going, and the scenarios are the worst. How do I move on? Make some improvements in my life. Should I just get the job as a cashier or as a helper—and let them see how much I shake and how fragile I am? So I get made fun of. That I can’t do anything right. That every choice I make is foolish. It’s so irksome. Maybe I just need rest🫩. But this just genuinely drains me so bad that I want to lash out at everyone and just drown in my sorrows. I just hate myself. Why can’t people just let people be… (I feel bad because people live way worse, and they do anything to be in my shoes.) I also got no friends to talk to about any of this—well, I thought I did, but they just abandoned me, or maybe I wasn’t reaching out enough. Idk, really.

Please don't wish me a happy birthday, I'll just tell you part of my story. I don't know why.\n\nIt day reminds me that I'm doing nothing in life. All my efforts are either stress\/injury, or I'm not even trying.\nA couple of days ago, I got a new job. I worked in -15 degrees Celsius on a construction site. It was tough, both mentally and physically, because it was my first job in a year. Before that, I'd worked for a week because work was finished. I felt bad mentally. I see that people aren't bad, but... I just feel bad around 50-year-old men who don't complain, while I'm a whiner in my head... I can't do anything in life.\n\nAfter that, I've feel nothing, for the last four days. Just fog.\nMy birthday was a couple of days ago, I even forgot it was mine. My dad and grandma congratulated me.\n\n  I feel like something is clearly wrong in my life. I clearly can't live like normal people.\n The only thing that was even slightly touching was when I was playing Minecraft with a friend... it was very sweet. But unfortunately, that quickly evaporates when I'm practically alone. And then we talked today, and she said we should stop talking at one day in future. I'm not angry or offended. Just fog.\nIn real life, I have friends, but unfortunately, I can't talk to them about this emptiness. And they can't do anything... there's just nothing. I'm asexual myself, I don't like to be proud of it, I don't like to talk about it in general. I live in Latvia, I'm Russian, Russians are not well-liked here, there's war, I have no homeland, no friends who understand irl.  I'd like to speak Russian, but I have to speak English... Life for me is like an arthouse film, in a foreign language... it seems like something is happening on the screen, but you don't understand anything.

There is no way that my wife would accept that I’m trans and she has significant physical and mental health issues. Two of my sons might accept the real me, if she were to surface. My mother and probably all of my five siblings would not accept me either. I think, however, that almost all of my 11 nieces and nephews would accept me. Minimum one who happens to be transmasc.\n\nNot sure if my assessment that no one would be  accepting of the real me, is me projecting, but I think I’ve thought about it long enough to be pretty much right.\n\nI’m not sure that I will ever be able to come out and be my authentic self. Ever.\n\nWhat’s holding me back? Mostly it’s my wife’s medical condition. If she divorced me, or worse, I would forsake the acceptance of my friends and family, in a nanosecond, to be me.\n\nBut I am pretty much resigned to never being able to be myself, to continue to fake this persona that everyone else knows and likes, for the rest of my life. \n\nAnd in doing so, I am  committing to be utterly alone for whatever length of time I have left in my life, because the real me will never speak to anyone, interact with anyone, or even touch anyone.\n\nThe real me is destined to live inside me for eternity. \n\nI’m not sure that there is anything else I can do, other than grin and bear it. \n\nAll that I guess l can hope from writing this, is that in some minuscule way, it will help to alleviate some of the loneliness I feel to the very centre of my being, every day.

I was born quite shy, and due to some kinetic difficulties I had as a child, I never learned to play and socialize with the others. Instead, I collected rocks and lived in my own fantasy world, soon to be bullied and alienated.\n\nI think I never adopted the social etiquette that is so easily followed by the majority. To this day, I've never gotten fully integrated to the communities I frequently visit and am, in a sense, a part of. Of course, I know what is appropriate and what is not, it's just that so many things do not interest me. I feel like I'm almost performing femininity, like an actor, not a genuine woman\n Talking about everyday topics feels so strange to me, no matter how hard I try to be normal.\n\n I'd rather talk about philosophy or art, but I guess I'm too boring or just lack at social skills, as people get quiet when I try to streak a conversation. When I find people who would like to talk, however, it feels special, like we are one, like I was at home, but for one reason of another we will part soon. I, of course, prefer solitude, but these moments are special. I am so sure to treasure them in my heart.\n\nIt may sound silly, but I do think that the ones who have spent much of their time of developing alone, for one reason or another, are simply a bit different from the others. Perhaps our thinking patterns have developed differently, perhaps the way we process information is different, perhaps the secret lays in the search of mindfulness and insight in relationships. Some people get a bit entitled, calling it intelligence - I'm not exactly sure about that either, I think it's just about the differences inherent to our existence. Of course, people who think in unusual ways may succeed academically, economically or artistically - and perhaps it is due to the way they - or we - were born. While others succeed at social skills, we do so in other topics.\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts!","selftext_word_count":365,"score":32,"num_comments":12,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loner\/comments\/u1xyie\/sometimes_i_feel_like_we_are_an_another_breed_of\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loner\/comments\/u1xyie\/sometimes_i_feel_like_we_are_an_another_breed_of\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loner_20260209_184005\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

By third grade or so three or four females would sit with me (male). Middle of fourth grade social anxiety bothered me so much I convinced Mom to homeschool me.\n\nThis was days before my 10th Birthday. I stayed mostly a loner for the next four years. Then, decided to go to public High School. Made it two weeks of the block schedule. Then, went back to homeschooling. \n\nThroughout my teen years I tried church youth groups, hanging with neighbor kids after school. Nothing stuck. I graduated a private Home School program. \nAfter that I went to College out of State. Living in the dorm there was some forced socializing. But, I was always a fifth wheel or invited by someone who knew I'd otherwise be alone. A year of that I returned home.\n\nI had a job at a pizza shop within days of returning home. There were usually three or four guys smoking weed on breaks. So, I was the lookout in case Corporate or a customer showed up. I went to a few work parties, but topped my run and coke off with coke so not to be drunk. I still just watched the the party from the corner of the room.\n\nFast Forward twenty years, it's just my wife son and me. Mom is close and my two siblings talk fairly often.  My wife is a loner too. She raises our son and is close to her dad and a couple of aunts.\n\nI'd honestly prefer staying home with the kiddo and dogs than grab coffee with a guy I've known twenty nine years. Is that horrible? I just don't want to waste two hours listening to the same guy talk about the same plans that he did nearly thirty years ago. I do have two friends since grade school. And I barely message either.  No hard feelings. It's just that those two are social people. Social to the extent that there's back stabbing in their  circles.

My family tends to move a lot due to low funds, and the times I do get to stay somewhere, other circumstances split me up from people I start becoming friends with. Every single year since kindergarten I have lost my best friend from either class separation, them moving, or myself moving. Around 6th grade, I gave up on making friends but still made them anyway without much effort. Even with that, they still left every year. Around this time I also started getting really involved online. I met some really toxic people just so I could have some people to talk to, but they almost have \"ruined\" me if I had to describe the situation. Nearly their entire lives revolved around monetary income and assets, which my family doesn't have much of. They would tend to not address me without some sort of making fun of my money or my looks. Now its hard to live my life without constantly thinking about how wealthy or attractive I look, and I hate it. All it does is hurt me making friends in the real, which is hard either way with COVID. Idk, it just seems like the world is working so hard against me and it would be impossible to overcome it.

Most of the activity in society is subconsciously designed to quell the voice crying in the wilderness within you.","selftext":"The mystic Thomas a Kempis said that when you go out into the world, you return having lost some of yourself. Until you learn to inhabit your aloneness, the lonely distraction and noise of society will seduce you into false belonging, with which you will only become empty and weary. When you face your aloneness, something begins to happen. Gradually, the sense of bleakness changes into a sense of true belonging. This is a slow and open-ended transition but it is utterly vital in order to come into rhythm with your own individuality. In a sense this is the endless task of finding your true home within your life. It is not narcissistic, for as soon as you rest in the house of your own heart, doors and windows begin to open outwards to the world. No longer on the run from your aloneness, your connections with others become real and creative. You no longer need to covertly scrape affirmation from others or from projects outside yourself. This is slow work; it takes years to bring your mind home.\" --JOHN O'DONOHUE, Eternal Echoes","selftext_word_count":185,"score":40,"num_comments":2,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/loner\/comments\/mvxj8x\/each_one_of_us_is_alone_in_the_world_it_takes\/","permalink":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/loner\/comments\/mvxj8x\/each_one_of_us_is_alone_in_the_world_it_takes\/","over_18":false,"removed_by_category":null,"source_file":"..\/data\/ph1\/new_1000_loner_20260209_184005\/raw\/reddit_submissions.ndjson","language":"en"}

I'm a loner who still wish I had more of a life. \n\nI (22F) have been in med school in Kerala, India for the past 4.5 years. 1.5 more years to go. I live with my parents. I commute to and from college. I speak to the few classmates in my batch who're in the same dept as me for our clinical rotations. And that's all I do. All I've been doing since high school. I did have friends in middle school. But became a loner from high school. I can't relate to most things to do with the medical profession bcz, imposter syndrome. Plus the college I'm in is of a lower tier, as it's private and not a government college, which are the best. So obviously inferiority of that too. I'm posting this as part of my coping mechanism. I don't think I'm a bad person. I'm more or less a pushover. I agree with everyone's opinions, even tho I have some of my own as well. My parents are supportive in every way. However I just spend all my life at home, looking at my phone, eating, sleeping and sometimes cooking. And I work out. Idk what I'm trying to achive by saying all this. They're all just a couple facts abt my life. Anyway, even tho I don't have friends at college, going there everyday and attending rotations, is the only thing giving me a bit of self esteem at the moment. I have one internet friend tho, they're lovely. Also I believe I'm destined to be single for life even though I'm not extremely ugly, only like half ugly. Anyway, that's for another day.

It's a mixture of events that transpired - some 'randoms' mocked me online and made youtube videos about me which I discovered to be two friends that I thought were close because we'd never really had any 'full conflicts' like the others in the friendship group. When I found out I confronted them, two of them began to punch me in a half-jokey way, but I knew it was my time to get the hell out.\n\nWell, I did. Then my school was placed on lockdown and now, a few months later, it's my time to head back to my school. Though, my only anxiety I have is that I'm going to be alone now. I'm in a school where everybody knows everybody and I'm essentially acquaintances with most people, though just not friends - mostly because we respect one another but don't have really anything in common. I only have a year and a bit until I graduate and go off to college (I'm in Britain) so I can't bring myself to focus on making any new friends.\n\nMy problem is, a lot of my acquaintances often remark when I'm alone and ask me where my usual group of friends are. I don't want to explain anything to them as to not rehash old stuff so I am unsure how to respond.

Since coming to college I’ve now truly noticed that I don’t enjoy talking and interacting with others. But I’m confused if I’m just bad with people or actually just like to be alone. It’s always been hard for me to partake in small talk and just act normal with people. Every morning I wake up and wonder what I’m even doing in this world, why was I put here? I try to answer this and tell myself this is how the universe made me and I should be happy to here. But I’m not happy. Everyone that walks past seems to give me looks as I must come off as unapproachable, but I actually see myself as a caring and helpful person. I don’t want to make it seem like I’m complimenting myself but I enjoy giving to people or helping them, if someone needs something I will always try to assist. If people would give me a chance and try to understand me I feel like we could relate. I’ve always viewed others as the “bad guys” but now I’ve realized I don’t give people the opportunity to get to know me because all my previous experiences has brought me nothing but emptiness. I want to live a normal guys life I think, but I guess it’s just not for me.  On top of it I have intense rosacea on my face and it’s seems to give off the image of me being a monster or alien to others. People will be walking with friends then stop talking when they pass to then just break out in laughter preceding to call me “red face” or “rosey” I witness that everyday, I try not to let it get to me but I can’t help it. I feel that it is a big reason why I’ve kind of just given up on people and trying to form relationships.

Please add any constructive criticism!  See below my manifesto \\(hey that rhymes!\\)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nLoneliness poses an alarming public health threat to industrialized nations. Many know \\(and feel\\) they should be more social, but for so many reasons \\(busier work, alienating technology, social anxiety\\) citizens’ social lives have grown increasingly spare and windblown, sometimes without them realizing until it’s too late. Loneliness has become a quicksand for many.\n\nResearch bears this out: A recent [Cigna survey](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2018\/05\/01\/loneliness-poor-health-reported-far-more-among-young-people-than-even-those-over-72\/559961002\/) of 20,000 Americans found that the national average loneliness score was a 44 on a scale of 20 to 80. Younger people \\(the so\\-called Generation Z\\) were disproportionately affected, with scores of 48. Their scores were higher than those 75 or older, who scored an average of nearly 39. Considering that longitudinal studies have found people with fuller social lives *are 50\\% more likely to survive than those who don’t* \\(an effect as powerful as smoking cessation\\) the need to address loneliness leaps into startling focus \\(Holt\\-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010, p. 14\\).  Put it this way: loneliness isn't just depressing \\-\\- it's lethal.\n\nAt Unalone, we believe human connection is a fundamental human need – a right – and are drafting ideas to address this urgent issue. We recognize loneliness as a mental and physiological state *distinct* from depression, although it shares many symptoms \\(Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008, pp. 83\\-86\\). We also realize that loneliness may present differently based on personality, age, situation, and culture.\n\nHere are some ideas we are currently exploring:\n\n• A decentralized organization inspired by Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\n• A hackathon on loneliness.\n\n# References\n\nCacioppo, J.

Not something centralised and top down, but rather distributed. \n* **Input:** we see potential if we go to talk to experts in the field, e.g. academics\/practitioners\/authors. Insurances may also be interested in the topic. But talking to non-experts concerned by  loneliness is an important topic.\n* **Explicite\/implicit**: Question that came up: Should we rather focus on a positive wording (e.g. \"purpose\") or actually talk about \"loneliness\". There are many meetups\/organisations that are organised with the purpose to bring people out of loneliness, where that topic is never intentionally and explicitly brought up. There seems to be a consensus that we should explicitly mention \"loneliness\" but in combination with positive wordings, in particular \"purpose\". \n**New people**: It's good to see that since we started, we had practically each time a new person joining in. \n\nNext steps: \n\n* **Google drive.** Already set up,\n* **Website:** Basic website is ready. Content under heavy work though (text now on shared google drive. \n* **Exploration:** Continue exploring \/ talk to people to get feedback and input and integrate insights into document now on google drive.\n\n**Next meetup: Saturday, May 12th, usual time. 11am CDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST.

Simple but functional. The more we talk around us, the more it's important to have it.\n* New person: Steve joined us. \n* Brainstorming: We talked about content and format of the hackathon and how to get people involved. The number of people who want to help is growing, but the concept around all of it is still very vage. We could try to connect to groups on Meetup.com who have a local presence. Spreading the word through these? Thus maybe organise a meetup that is not fully online only, but with local \"branches\" that meet face to face? And should this hackathon be part of something bigger? But how to build something bigger without a central organisation?  \n* Mission statement: Linked to the above, we thought that it might be useful to work on something like a \"mission statement\", some guiding principles (more than what is currently in the [wiki](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalone\/wiki\/index) that could be used as a general framework to guide our discussions. \n* Purpose: Based on some discussions on Reddit, it seems that lack of \"Purpose\" is something lonely people often lack.

Why is it so hard to find a guy friend who’s older, and just actually have them as a friend? I’m sure it’s because I have a shit relationship with my older brother and my father, I’m not looking for a sugar daddy or anything like that. It’s just for some reason older men make me calm.
